2022-01-26 19:30:00,2022-01-26 19:30:00,2022-01-26 19:40:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December bringing them to an end in early March. As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Amichron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. An activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs. Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Amichron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth. That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain, and we have not lost sight of the fact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health care workers on the front lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship. The labor market has made remarkable progress, and by many measures is very strong. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months. Over the past year, payroll employment has arisen by 6.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past 6 months, to reach 3.9 percent in December. The improvement in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand remains historically strong. With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who would otherwise be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability. We are committed to our price stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. And we'll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the committee left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan announced in December to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we've seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2% longer run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expected will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We'll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes. With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected. And are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, today the committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions. These high level principles clarify that the federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy, and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities roll off our balance sheet. Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily treasury securities. Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals. In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in late of economic and financial developments. The committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet, and we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you for the first question. We'll go to Chris and Reggae. Thank you. Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell. So, it's expected that the Fed will hike rates, perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting. So, I just wanted to ask, you know, our rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year is every meeting a live meeting. And on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes even if it doesn't raise every meeting? Thank you. Thanks. So, as I refer to in my opening statement, it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate. And so, at this time, we haven't made any decisions about the path of policy. And I stress again that we'll be humble and nimble. We're going to have to navigate cross-currences and actually two-sided risks now. So, and I'll say also that we're going to be guided by the data. In fact, what I'll say is that we're going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook. We'll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily in transparency, transparent. So, more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The labor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above or 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven't made any decisions. Thank you. Let's go to Victoria Guida at Politico. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you were talking about the health of the labor market. And I'm curious whether you would characterize where we're at right now as maximum employment. And also along those same lines, obviously.",-0.0057354806559753,0.007412982984352903
2022-01-26 19:30:00,2022-01-26 19:40:00,2022-01-26 19:50:00," the rate hikes on the table this year. Do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages? Sorry, just getting both parts of your question written down. So I would say, and this view is widely held in the committee that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability. And that is my personal view. And again, very broad support on the committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The other thing is maximum employment will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle. In the particular situation we're in now, it may well increase the level of maximum employment that's consistent with stable prices may increase. And we hope that it will as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises. And the policy path that we're broadly contemplating would be supportive of that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are many millions of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can raise rates and move to less accommodative and even tight financial conditions without hurting the labor market. I think there's quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market. This is by so many measures, historically tight labor market. Record levels of job openings, of quits, wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs. Plentyful look at surveys of companies, they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels really that we haven't seen in a long time in some cases ever. So this is a very, very strong labor market. And my strong sense is that we can move rates up without having to severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation. We hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come at the timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of growth this year, not of the level of economic activity. But the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing and pace of that are highly uncertain. And that inflation has persisted longer than we thought. And of course, we're prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. Thank you. Let's go to Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. The statement on the balance sheet today calls for significantly reducing your holdings. What does that mean? And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And finally, how much disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales, or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you. So I'm afraid to tell you that those are all great questions. And there are questions that the committee is just turning to now. So we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a team up of the issues at this meeting. We've gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level. And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we'll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you're asking. And I expect that this process will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings. I can't tell you how many, I can't tell you how long it will take. And then, you know, at the appropriate time, we'll provide additional information. So I did the last cycle when we went through balance sheet issues. We did find that over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought. So we're just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we'll be turning to more of the details that you're asking about. I would say this, the balance sheet is much bigger. It has a shorter duration than the last time. And the economy's much stronger. And inflation's much higher. And I think that leads you to, and I've said this, being willing to move sooner than we did in the last time. And also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it's really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be. But I would point you to principle number one, which is the committee views changes in the target rate for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. So we do want the federal funds rate. We want to operationalize that. And we want the balance sheet to be declining in a predictable manner. And we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments. So if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet, both restrained the economy, both tied in monetary policy, how should we think about the relationship between the two? For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every quarter percentage point increase in your benchmark rate? So again, we think of the balance sheet as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them its the federal funds rate. There are rules of thumbs. I'm reluctant to land on one of them that equate this. And there's also an element of uncertainty around the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and hence the economic conditions. Balance sheet is still a relatively new thing for the markets and for us. So we're less certain about that. So again, I think the pattern we'll follow is to arrive at a timing and a pace and composition and all those things. And then announce that with advanced notice. And it will start in the background. And then we'll look to have that just running in the background and have the interest rates again, be the active tool of monetary policy. That's at least a plan. I can't tell you much more about any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things. We'll be turning to all of those at coming meetings. Thank you. Thanks. Now we'll go to Neil Irwin. Thank you, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. Glad to be back. So I was wondering if the volatility we've seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy. Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some might that be desirable in some ways and achieving your tightening goals? So as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy, maximum employment and price stability. And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what we're always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough of a change in financial conditions that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goal? So that's how we're looking at that. And I don't want to comment on today's financial conditions broadly, but we're not looking at any one market or so. So that's how we're thinking. In terms of what we've seen, I would say this. We said at our last meeting, we published this summary of economic projections, the meeting of which the median participant expected three rate increases this year. And it's six weeks, seven weeks later now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working. And markets are now pricing in. Number of rate increases. Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year, perhaps we haven't made that decision yet. So we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working. And that the financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make. And monetary policy works significantly through expectations. So that that in and of itself is appropriate. Thank you. Let's go to Howard Schneider. But you know, for a year or a high thanks to your power side with words. So for a year now, the statements reference the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase. Now that we're approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?",-0.0085189296961732,0.00911854103343467
2022-01-26 19:30:00,2022-01-26 19:50:00,2022-01-26 20:00:00, you can't stipulate the path but how should we think about the criteria for the next step? Well you're right we haven't gotten we haven't gotten to that point we haven't made a decision yet and we'll make that decision at the March meeting we'll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate I would say that the committee is is of a mind to to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so we have we have our eyes on on the risks particularly around the world but we do expect some softening in the economy from Amichron but we think that that should be temporary and we think that the economy should the underlines with the economy should you know should should show through further quickly after that. If I could follow just on relating questions the December steps on this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral given development since then do you still think that's a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy? I path is highly uncertain and that we're committed using our tools to make sure that inflation high inflation that we're seeing does not become entrenched so a number of factors would be it's not just monetary policy a number of factors are supporting a decline in inflation as I mentioned fiscal policy will be will prove parting significantly less of an impulse to growth we do expect this year although we do expect now that it will come slower than than we had expected and hoped that there will be relief on the supply side so that too should should lower these supply side bearers which are a big part of the story why inflation is like in addition monetary policy will be coming significantly less accommodative so the question is you know we'll we'll be asking this question all year long and that will be our things turning out as we expect there's a case that for whatever reason the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected we'll react to that if instead we see inflation at a higher level or more persistent level then we'll react to that and again we're well aware that this is a different economy than then existed during the last tightening cycle and our policies going to reflect those differences thank you let's go to Gina Smialing let's go to Gina okay let's go to Steve Leesman thank you misshault thank you miss chairman i misshault i have one sort of technical question and one question on principle um the technical question is if you're going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won't begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes it seems to technically mean that you won't or can't begin balance sheet reduction until the summer is that correct it's the first thing second of all you suggested that the um with balance sheet running in the background that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the same time that's sort of the technical question part of it the principle question i have as you said it's going to be running in the background but the statement on on balance sheet principle says the committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach based on economic and financial developments which suggests there's something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won't be running in the background so could you give us any a sense of the discussion or a staff presentation on what is the reaction functions surrounding the balance sheet so let me let me let me start by talking about that last paragraph so you'll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one and it involves inevitably surprises and so during during the years during the prior cycle we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times now we didn't intend to do that it just events required us to do so so we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we're free to do this at any time and it doesn't mean we're going to but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought we're not going to be we're not going to stick with something that isn't working that that's all that saying it's meant to be quite a general statement rather than a hint so I mean I I like to think that our you know our philosophy of the balance sheet is embodied in these principles so you know the idea that for example the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy that will use the determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate that will begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates and on and on like that I mean that those are all the things that try to describe how we will proceed but maybe at a higher level to try to get at your question you know asset purchases were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function as they were right after the in the critical phase of the global financial crisis and then after they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand and now the economy no longer needs this this highly accommodative policy that we put in place so it's time to stop asset purchases first and then at the appropriate time start to shrink the balance sheet now the balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be we've identified the end state as you know mounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently effectively in the ample reserve regime so there's a substantial amount of of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done that's going to take some time we want that process to be orderly and predictable and so those are some of the ways I would think this this lays out our you know the way we the way we're thinking about this in terms of the timing I I can't really help you you know it just says after after we get underway so we're I would say we are we're going to have another discussion at the next meeting and I guess as we'll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that and you know we'll we'll we'll tell you as we make progress and we'll you know we'll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet well at what we find to be the appropriate time it's I wish I could say more but honestly we haven't made those decisions and we actually haven't even really had the the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings thank you let's go to crack torus chair Powell chair Powell good afternoon Michelle and chair Powell Craig George from Bloomberg chair Powell at the beginning of the conversation you said risks are too cited and I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing is fed policy or risk over tightening or what are the risks and then second chair Powell I have a quick administrative question you know Robert Kaplan's disclosure of his securities transactions and in a couple months chair Powell or maybe sooner you and I will file our tax returns and we'll list transactions and all kinds of things and next to those transactions we'll put dates and Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr Kaplan's transactions the Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates and I don't see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else I mean why can't he give us the dates will you help us get the dates of those transactions thanks so you asked about the risks first so I you know the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and certainly in my view as well there's a risk that that the high inflation we're seeing will be prolonged and there's a risk that it will move even higher so and we don't we don't think that's the base case but you ask what the risks are and that's we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes and that calls for us to be in position we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved but we've got to be in a position to address different outcomes including the one where inflation remains higher and of course that is a risk to the to the to the expansion you know we've been saying that what we need here is another long expansion which is the kind of thing we saw over the last which is the record long expansion we saw labor force participation rise we saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower and there really was no obvious imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion it could have gone on for years were it not hit by the pandemic so we'd love to find a way to get back to that that's going to require price stability and that's going to require the Fed to tighten it,0.0034962622196664,0.005636200510708755

One, the COVID is not over and COVID can continue to evolve. And it's just we have to accept that it's not over and the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be that's sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint. Another point to, you know, another risk is just further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that's their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns. It's likely to and that may play into, may play into more problems in supply chains. In addition, there's what's going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there's plenty of risk out there. And we, you know, we can't forget that there are risks on both sides. So that's there. That's what I would say. I know you've been all over this issue with my colleagues Craig on the issue of information. We don't have that information at the board. And, you know, I asked the Inspector General to do an investigation. And that is out of my hands. I have playing no role in it. I seek to play no role in it. And I don't, I really, I can't help you here today on this issue. And I'm sorry I can't. Thank you. We'll go to Gina now. Thanks for taking our question to Chair Powell and the sorry for my tech issues. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where you're thinking on inflation stands today. You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year. And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one. And if you're thinking it's changed at all, I wonder how you're thinking about that. And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deserteration. Like how do we get from here 7% CPI to where you expect to be at the end of the year. So I'd say, you know, since since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same, but probably slightly worse. I'd be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation. Let's just go with that by a few tents today. But we're not writing down an SEP at this meeting, but I think it hasn't gotten better. It's probably gotten just a bit worse. And that's been the pattern. That's been the pattern. So I think if you look at the FOMC participants are there's a range there. And that range has been moving to the right for a year now. And by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you've seen the same pattern. So what do we think about that? Well, I think we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually. And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that. If it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned, though, I think it's part of this will be that we're the Fed moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy. And then over time to a policy that's not accommodative in time. I don't know when that will be. That's those are the things that we're thinking about. That's that's part of it. Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years. That impulse will be less. In fact, will be will be negative this year. And so that's another thing. The other one is we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And you know, the ports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now what what we're learning is it's just taking much longer. I think longer than expected. And that I think does raise raise the risk that in that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think will come off of the highs that we saw in the in the early part of this episode in the in the spring last year. But really what's the question is going to be what what is inflation running at. And so we'll be watching that. And I you know we our objective is to get inflation back down to 2%. And it's also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very very strong right now. And I think that that strength will continue. There's really a shortage of workers. We see it particularly among production and non supervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other indicators. So I think that's that's what we're looking at. And we're also you know we realize I think as everyone does that this outlook is quite uncertain. And that we're going to have to adapt. And we're going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we're going to have to be adaptable and. You know move move as appropriate. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to cold. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path for for monetary policy. Does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and say doing a 50 basis points hike at some point. If inflation does not moderate sufficiently. And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle. As I mentioned we have not made these decisions. We really haven't. And what I can tell you now though is. That we fully appreciate that this is a different situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, 16, 17, 18, when we were raising rates. Inflation was very close to 2% even below 2%. Unemployment was was not at our estimates of the natural. Rate and growth was you know in the 2 to 3% range. Right now we have inflation running substantially above 2%. And you know more persistently than we would like. We have growth even in forecast even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022. We still see growth higher than substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where by so many measures it is historically tight. I think the you know in a way the least tight aspect of it is looking at the unemployment rate which is still below our median estimate of maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and job openings as I mentioned earlier and wages you're seeing and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed you're seeing a very very tight labor market. Now we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It's a percentage point and a half lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a percentage point of that is is retirements. Some part of those retirements are related to COVID rather than just regular retirements. So we think there is there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force. But it's not happening very quickly and it may not continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on. So that's that's that's how we think about that. We haven't made to your specific question. We really have not addressed those questions and we'll begin to address them as we as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that. Let's go to Rachel. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower lower income earners. And are you worried that the Fed underestimates or can't effectively measure the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households. Thank you. It's more a matter of I think the problem that we're talking about here is really that people are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck. They're spending most or all of their of what they're earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that's really the point. I don't I'm not aware of inflation literally falling more on different socio economic groups. That's not the point. The point is some people are just really in prone to suffer more. I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn't good. It's bad. A high inflation is bad. But they're going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive their cars and things like that. It's more so that's really how I think of it. And you know, we we um.",-0.0082737440410708,0.010186132654242395

Thank you, let's go to Edward Lawrence. Thanks, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here. So year over year, inflation's at 40-year high, the input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record. Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late. Now you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today. And as a follow-up that, because I have problems with the mute button. As a follow-up that you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked up at the end of the year. You talked about that today. The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023. So today, you said inflation will start to ease this year. I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we can see that relief. Thank you. So I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of the year. I do not expect them, and I have not expected them. What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly, progress. Because we're not making much progress. If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorters and inventories in some industries moving up. But overall, we're not making progress. And things like the semiconductor issue are going to be quite a long time. I would think they'll go more than through 2023. So in terms of being too late, I would just say this, our policy needs to be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said. And particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher more persistently than we'd expected. And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and we're committed to doing that. And that's really where we are. In terms of your question about the size of rate increases, we haven't faced those decisions. We haven't made them. It isn't possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the precise path will be. But in as we work our way through this meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different expansion. As I've said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy. And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in the policy that we implement. Thank you. Let's go to Mike McKee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is, are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2%, do you want to go below 2% so that on average you get a 2% inflation rate? And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side? So no, there's nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2%. So that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the answer to that is no. What we're trying to do is keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2%. That's always the ultimate goal. And we do that in the service of having inflation, we get to that goal by having inflation average 2% over time. I mean, if inflation doesn't average 2% over time, then it's not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2%. So that's the way we think about that. You know, what was the last part of your question? I was asking if you're protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there's some sort of circuit breaker there. Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market and you have growth this year at forecast to be well above potential. I mean, people are forecasting growth. You think potential growth is around two, most forecasters significantly above that for 2022. And that's even with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market's going to be strong for some time. We ideally, what we're trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2%. And we're trying to do that in a process that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take. Again, I would say that it isn't just monetary policy that's helping inflation get down. It'll be supply side improvements. And it'll be less fiscal impulse, you know, likelihood. So but monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2%. And a situation where the two goals can be intention is a difficult one. But I don't really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market and the form of higher participation over time is high inflation. And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these large wage increases that we're seeing now. So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve both of those goals. If I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions rather than the state dependency you've been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so? The dependency was particularly around the thought that if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation, actual inflation before we tightened. And so that was a very state dependent thought, because for a long time, we'd been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared. And that was the case for a number of years. So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook. Let's go to Michael Derby. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I realize I mean that is what it is, but do you feel that monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we're having right now is because the government in response collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing? So I think it's too soon to write that history really. But what I would say is this, if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really a long time to get them. And then you have economic activity drops by a shocking amount in one course. So there was a real risk of lasting damage. And I think Congress responded remarkably with the CARES Act, incredibly timely, very powerful. People will always be flaws in these things. But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded, and what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act. So now that was a lot of, that was a lot. And what we did was a lot. And you know, now, so what we have now is we have the strongest recovery of any country. And we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we've had because we've put so much support behind the recovery. And we're managing the relatively high class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage. So, and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we're working as hard as we can on. Was it too much? Again, I'm going to leave that to the historians. But in 25 years, we'll look back at this incident, which will be a two, three, four, five-year period. And we'll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took. But it was all founded, though, in a very strong reaction to a unique historical event. And I guess I'll have to leave it that. I hope I'll be around to see how that looks in 25 years. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Gene Young. Thanks, Michelle. Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield curve could flatten or even.",0.002835890283589,0.005997489423032182

So we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don't control the slope of the yield curve. Many factors influence longer term interest rates, but it is something that we watch in, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago. And we take it into account along with many other financial conditions as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that's one thing I would say. Another is currently you've got a slope if you think about two's to tens, two, two, three to tens, or a treasury, I think that's around 75 basis points. That's well within the range of a normal yield curve slope. So it's something we're monitoring. We don't think of it as, I don't think of it as some kind of an iron law, but we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what is telling us, and it's one of many things that we monitor. Can I follow up real quick and ask if it did invert, would you tie it to US fundamentals or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors? We know that's a good question in real time. Obviously, the US long-term sovereign debt is an important global asset, and the fact that our rates are so much higher than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our rates, I don't know. But it would really depend on the facts and circumstances at that time. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chong for the last question. I'm Chairman Powell Brian Chong, Yahoo Finance. Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking? And then secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it's often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don't merge. Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates? Thanks. I would describe what we're doing along these lines. This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that's going to involve a number of things. It's going to involve, it does involve finishing asset purchases. It's going to involve lifting off, and it's going to involve additional rate increases. It has appropriate. And we're going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be. It's going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this. The last thing we're going to do is we're going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and do so in a predictable manner. And that's something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I wouldn't, I don't think it's possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we're going to need to be, as I've mentioned, nimble about this. And the economy's quite different this time. I've said this several times now. The economy's quite different. It's stronger, inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much stronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make, as we make monetary policy. And you asked about financials to be out of concerns. In connection with our policy, was that your question? Yeah, within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that. I didn't know if that was part of the discussion today. I would just say this. We, of course, have a financial stability framework. And what it shows is a number of positive aspects of financial stability. But you mentioned really asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don't really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability. And that's because households are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape financially. Defaults on business loans are low in that kind of thing. The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong. There are some concerns in the non-bank financial sector around, still around money market funds, although the SEC is making, has made some very positive proposals there. And we also saw some things in the treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which we're looking at ways to address. But overall, the financial stability, vulnerabilities are manageable, are manageable, I would say. Thank you very much. Thank you.",-0.000905944388952,0.004733479457165445
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:40:00," Good afternoon. My colleague is and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high on going progress in bringing it down is not assured. In the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory and we have been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3%. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1%. Bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past 3 months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago, but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome, but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% of points, and we've decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer, if appropriate. This labor market tightness has eased, and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we've seen on inflation, and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal, and to keeping longer run, longer term, inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions. Thank you. I'm Gina. I look from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don't want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming down fully. I wonder what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? As you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth and consumer spending data against the solid inflation progress you've been seeing? Sorry, I see that last part again. How are you weighing the growth data and consumption data which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data? Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We're looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And, implicitly, we do have confidence and has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It's not that we're looking for better data. It's that we're looking at continuation of the good data that we've been seeing. And a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that's six months of good inflation data. Is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a sustainable path down to 2% inflation? That's the question. And the answer will come from some more data that's also good data. It's not that the six month data isn't low enough. It is. It's just the question of, can we take that with confidence that we're moving sustainably down to 2%. That's really what we're thinking about. In terms of growth, we've had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth, very strong growth last year, going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down. So I think, whereas a year ago, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening and economic activity. That hasn't been the case. So I think we look at stronger growth, we don't look at it as a problem. I think at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We're not looking for a weaker labor market. We're looking for inflation to continue to come down as it has been coming down for the last six months. And I'm sorry if I could just follow up very quickly. When you say that you want to make sure that the true signal is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it's a true signal at this stage? No, I think it's, I would say it seems to be the likely case that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it and we haven't yet. And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have six months of good inflation, but you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative. It's a reasonable assumption that over time goods inflation will flatten out, probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number, not so much the composition, but we just need to see more. That's where we are as a committee. We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms.",4.105006054891865e-05,0.0004719576285104008

Well, I look I think as you know we consult the range of Taylor rules and non-tailor kind of rules we consult them regularly they're in our our teal book and and They're in all the materials that we look at but you know I don't think we've ever been at a state at a place where we were we were setting policy by them And they're depending on the rule It will tell you different things are many different formulations another way to think about it is implicitly is so In theory of course real rates go up if holding all else equal as inflation comes down But that doesn't mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates Sorry as inflation comes down doesn't mean that at all because for one thing We we don't know we look at more than just the Fed funds rate we look at Brawley financial conditions, but in addition we don't know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time But that also doesn't mean that we wait around for To see you know the economy turn down because that will be too late So we're really in a risk management mode of managing the risk as I mentioned in my opening remarks managing the risk that we move too soon and Would move too late and I think to move which is which is where Almost everyone in the committee is is in favor of of moving rates down this year But the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2% I Thanks, Chair Bill I'd like you to to key it on the use of the word in the statement that inflation still remains elevated You've pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2% so that implies that there's some sort of intermediate step here on inflation and that Cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that Inflation remains elevated. What's the step down from there? Yeah, I I don't know that we worked out the particular Statement language and that kind of thing. I would just say if you look at you look at where we're 12-month inflation is and It's you know, it's still well above core is 2.9% for example 12 months, which is way down from where it was very Very positive development very fast decline and and you know I the the cases likely that it will continue to come down So so that's where that's where it is, but we're you know, we're wanting to see you know more data So if I could follow up on that this statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut But it doesn't mention the other side of the mandate a slighted employment would a slighted employment also Bring you to the point of cutting rates Yes, so Let me say that we're not looking for that's not something we're looking for Yes, if you think about you know in the base case The economy is performing well the labor market remains strong if we saw an unexpected weakening in in certainly in the labor market that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner Absolutely, and if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or Those sorts of things would argue for moving later In the base case though, we're where the economy is healthy and we have as you know, we have ongoing growth solid growth We have a strong labor market we have inflation coming down That's what people are writing their SEP around and in that case what we're saying is Based on that we think we can and should Take advantage of that and and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction Okay Claire Jones financial times just a circle back to The greater confidence aspect of the statement There's been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings and just wondering going forward when it comes to All needing greater confidence is the unanimity or at least consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that Greater confidence is and if not could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on You know what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates And also if there was any variation on how quickly that greater confidence threshold could be reached Thank you. We're not we're not really at that stage You know, we're we're there was no proposal to cut rates Some people did you know talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the SEP As as you know as good evidence of where people are although it is it is one cycle later So, you know We're not we're not at a place of really working out those kinds of details because we weren't actively considering you know a Moving moving the federal funds rate down. I will say there's there is a wide disparity a healthy disparity of views And you see that in public public statements in the minutes And the transcripts when they're released every five years. So we do have a healthy A set of differences and I think that's actually essential for making good policy We're also able to reach Agreement generally because we listen to each other we we compromise and even though not everybody loves What we do they're able to for the most part able to join in to me that's a that's a well-functioning public institution Rachel Hi, Chair Powell Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions So over the past few years there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was like Open table data or office attendance You've talked about vacancies in the past And I'm wondering at the start of this year what might be on that dashboard for you that's giving you the clearest picture of the economy Including on runs if you could touch on that Including rent Yeah Well, so we're not you know, it's not the pandemic so we can actually rely on more more traditional forms people are working they're getting wages And any economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing as you see So I wouldn't say we're looking at that that sort of more innovative data as much Um, you know, you point to rent so of course we follow the components of inflation very carefully Which would be goods inflation I talked about that a little bit you mentioned housing inflation So the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents Dejimate as measured measured in PCE inflation and we think that's coming and we know it's coming It's just a question of when and how big it'll be So that's in and everyone's forecast I would say So that will that will help but at the same time we think goods inflation will probably It's been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort and probably that the clients over time But it may well have some some more time to run you know, these the supply chains are not Perfectly back to where they were in addition It takes time for the healing process to get into prices so there may be still a tail and we'll find out with with that So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully and As you would imagine I guess this is a quick follow-up. Do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing Or is that part of looking for more confidence? No, I wouldn't I wouldn't say we would achieve that and I think We have we have a ways to go inflation is still you know Core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis 12 months is our Our target certainly I'm encouraged and we're encouraged by the progress, but you know, we're We're not we're not declaring victory at all at this point.

So I'm wondering what you could tell me, how do you believe the neutral rate is working, we're telling you right now that growth is stronger. In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? I think you do see in the interest sensitive parts of the economy, you do see, for example, housing, you see the effects. Your second question, though, really, I think, is important. And that is a lot of this has come through a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you've seen that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter policy, which is enabled to supply side to recover, I think, is that that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So we really do think that we're having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it's a joint story. It's a complicated story. But how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy? Would you say relatives of the neutral rate? Of course, you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision. But if you, a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate 5.3%, let's say, and subtract sort of a forward measure of inflation. If you do that, there are many, many ways to calculate that neutral rate, but that's what I like to do. And you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate, you will. But at the same time, you look at the economy and you say, this is an economy that grew 3.1% last year. And you say, what does that tell you about the neutral rate? What's happening, though, is the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that won't go on forever. So a lot of the growth we're seeing is not, it isn't just a tug of war between interest rates and demand. You're getting more activity because of the labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is when that peters out, I think the restriction will show up probably more sharply. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question from the chairman. You mentioned earlier we're not seeking a weaker labor market. I think you said, can you talk a little bit more about that? Do you think the labor market now is back to, quote unquote, normal? And that we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic, even with today's ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic levels. I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal, but not totally back to normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. I think the labor market is a little bit more than normal. It's an ongoing process, a healthy one, and I think we're moving in the right direction. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically. I think the labor market is, it's rebalancing. Clearly, there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened, you remember, in 2021, you had a severe labor shortage. It was everywhere panic on a part of businesses couldn't find people. So what's happened is we expected labor, the labor supply labor market to come back quickly. And it didn't. In 2022, was it disappointing year? And we were kind of thinking, well, maybe we won't get it back. And then in 2023, we did. And then the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market. And so the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market. And so the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market. And so the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market, the labor market. And so the great way to look at that is what's happening with wage increases. And you see it now across the major things that we track. It isn't every quarter, but overall, there's a clear trend still at high levels, but back down to where what would be consistent with where we were before the pandemic. And with 2% inflation. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruegaber, an associated press. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Rich's question. It sounded like you suggested that you're not worried about faster growth so much. So I wanted to see if you're seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here. And it sounds like you're saying you're not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you. I think that is a risk. The risk that inflation would reaccelerate. I think the greater risk is that it would stabilize at a level, meaningfully above 2%. That's to me more likely. Of course, if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would be a surprise at this point. But I have to tell you, that's why we keep our options open here and why we're not rushing. So I think both of those are risks. But I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is you've had six good months, very good months. But what's really going to shake out here? When we look back, what will we see? Will inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are one of factors that won't repeat themselves? We don't think so. We don't, you know, there's not what we think. But that's the question we are asking. We have to ask. And we want to get comfort on that. And just one quick follow up. Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something you're watching as well? And if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence where things are going? We'll just have to see. Yeah, we'll we look at those last year was a was it a surprise? Michael McKeeblum, Radio and television. If you don't want to use the term soft landing, would you say at least that from your point of view now, the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risk of diminished very much. And as you mentioned, below 2% inflation for on a three month basis, core PCE has been running at 1.5%. And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? So how to disagree your first question how to describe where we are. So I guess I would just say this executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4% that hasn't happened in 50 years. So it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is this is a good situation. Let's be honest. This is a good economy. But what's the outlook that's looking in the review? The outlook we do expect growth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time and it hasn't happened. But we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. Labor market is rebalancing. As I mentioned, job creation has slowed the base of job growth has narrowed. And of course, 12 month inflation is above target and getting getting down closer to target. It's not guaranteed. But we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and questions we have to answer. But overall, it's a pretty good picture. It is a good picture. Your second question was sorry. Could you get inflation that is below target end up with inflation below target and you have to do something about that. So the thing is we're not looking for inflation to tap the 2% base once. We're looking for to settle out over time.",-0.0006357018353327,0.0006977078245879933

If we have a month or two of lower and we have that now of inflation that's annualized at a lower level, that wouldn't be good. We're not looking to have inflation anchor below 2%, we're looking to have it anchor at 2%. So if we do face those circumstances then we'll have to deal with that. I think as of now the question we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. Edward. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you for taking this. So as I've heard from some district Fed presidents is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner and then when we do see that first rate cut is that to be interpreted as the beginning of a rate cut cycle or is it a one off? So I'll point to that language on your first question. We included that language in the statement to signal clearly that with strong growth, strongly of a market inflation coming down, the committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context, current context, we're going to be data dependent, we're going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that, but that's to be seen. So I wouldn't call, you know, when you say, when you ask me about in the near term, I'm hearing that as March, I would say I don't think that's probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. Then your second question is. On the, is this the start of a, when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle or is it, you could just be one off? You know, that's going to depend on the data. The whole thing is this is going to depend on the data. We're going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks and we're going to make our decisions based on that. And it could wind up, you know, we'll, we'll have another SEP at the March meeting and people write down what they think, but in the end, it's really going to depend on how the economy evolves. We talked about there are risks that would cause us to go slower. For example, stronger inflation, more, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us to, or if they happen that would cause us to go faster or sooner. And that would be a weakening in the labor market or for that matter, very, very persuasive, lower inflation. Those are the kinds of things. So we're just, we're just going to be reacting to the data. That's, that's really the only way we can do this. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth? You know, you've mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that's consistent with 2% inflation. We've obviously seen, you know, you were talking about ECI this morning in which it's cooled a little bit, but still sort of above what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about? Or do you think that productivity growth will, will fade over time? So this is a really interesting question. And I think my, my own view is, I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off and, and activity didn't decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough of productivity. And then over the last, you saw high productivity last year in 23. I think we're, we're basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the, you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy? Is there, is there a case, will it be the case that we come out of this more productive, more on a sustained basis? And I don't know, I don't know. I, I, what would it take? It would take, you know, people talk about AI, but I would, my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were because I'm not sure I see work from home doesn't seem like it's a big productivity increase or AI, artificial intelligence generative may be, but probably not in the short run, probably maybe in the longer run. So I'm not, I'm not seeing why it would, but, you know, right, you know, right now, I would say we're, the productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed. Right. So would that be behind why we've seen such strong growth, but we've also seen inflation fall that maybe there's just a higher level of productivity that's one way to look at it. Yeah. Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, again, so with marketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I'm wondering how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates and it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. So when we think about, you know, our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability and that's what we're targeting. We're not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing or any of those things. Those are very important things for people's lives, but they're not, you know, those are not the things we're targeting. We're also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt because it's a very interesting sector. On top of that, we have longer run problems with the availability of housing. You know, we have a built-up set of cities and people are moving further and further out so that there hasn't been enough housing built and these are not things that we have any tools to address. But, you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. It's really rental inflation. You're taking owners equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants and you're running that through the CPI calculation or the PCE calculation, the one we look at. And what that's telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time it has to as long as that remains the case. So. And just real quick, what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable? My response is what I started with, which is that our job, the job Congress has given us, is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is absolutely essential for people's lives most importantly for not most importantly, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges, at the margins. And so someone for someone like that high inflation about when the necessities of life right away you're in trouble, whereas even middle class people have some scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get, it's our job. It's what societies asked us to do is to get inflation down. The tools that we use to do it are interest rates. So that's how we think about that. Courtney. Courtney Brown from Exxios. Can you give us some insight into whether the committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead? Yes. So. I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well. And as the processes continue, we're getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at this meeting we did have some discussion of the balance sheet and we're planning to begin in depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those questions are all coming into scope now and we're focusing on them but we're at the beginning of that process I would say. Quick follow up. Is the case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem? Yes. We do we see those as independent tools and so they don't for example, if you're normalizing policy you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases that's normalization but from a strict monetary policy standpoint you could say we're loosening and one with tightening. So that could happen. It's not something we're planning or thinking about but right now we're thinking about getting to a place where we're going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We're watching it carefully and as I said we'll be looking into that as a committee starting in March. Thanks. Slide. Slide, Mr. Binninvich with the economist. Thank you Chair Powell. You've mentioned six good months of inflation data but not being enough to build up confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn't start easing yet in March. The implication is that eight good months might not be enough either. Roughly how many months do you think you might need of good inflation data to be confident? I'm not in the position to put a number on it. I'm just going to say and it's not that we don't have any confidence. We have growing confidence but not to the point where we feel like it's a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialing back.",-0.0021541554684775,0.004509513219668886

And we want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market inflation coming down, it gives us the ability to do that. We think that's the best way we can serve the public because ultimately we've made a lot of progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way. That's how we're thinking about it. In terms of when that'll be, that'll all come out of our communications, and we won't keep that a secret. Hi, Chair Powell. Evan Reiser with M&I Market News. Can you explain a little bit more on what you're considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there? Not a decision that we've made, but I wouldn't think we'd be taking a position that's got to go to zero. I mean, if it were to stabilize it a different way, but that's not a decision that we've made. That's what we'll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up in the committee. We'll get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let's say, year or so. Great. Thanks, Craig Grapp from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I want to change gears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that's been going on for the last nine months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates have said that they probably wouldn't want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about that. Do you want another term you've had on the Fed? What's your stance on that? I don't have a stance on that. It's not something I'm focused on. Focused on doing our jobs. This year is going to be a highly consequential year for the Fed and for monetary policy, and we're all of us very buckled down focused on doing our jobs. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Johnberger with Yahoo Finance. As you mentioned, Core PCE has been running at 1.9% over the past six months, and you guys are actually expecting Core inflation higher this year at 2.4% compared to that six month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it's been over the last six months for the next six months? So we're going to do, we'll update our inflation forecasts at the next meeting. You refer to the December meeting that's three months old, so it might be lower now given the data we've gotten. So look, as I mentioned, we're going to be wracking to the data. If we get very strong inflation data and it kicks back up, then it will go slower or later or both. If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the, that would tell us that we could go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we're just going to be, but of course we'll weigh that with all the other factors. We're setting policy based on the totality of the data. But just to follow, if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive, would that mean you'd have to trim more perhaps than you already have factored in? Well, I think if we came to the view that if the inflation were, that the six month inflation numbers, which are very close to two, were in PCE world, if we came to the, if we thought that is really where we're going to be, then yes, our policy would be in a different place. But, you know, that's the whole point is we're trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where that inflation is on a sustainable bet path down to two percent or toward two percent. Hi, Chepp. Daniela, this is Ajahn's Foreign Press. I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just wonder, is it fair to say they're moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent months? And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that and what challenges do you see going forward? Thank you. Yes, so it's been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak at a time when unemployment has been low, very low, historically low for a couple of years. But nonetheless, that's been the case. And we've asked ourselves why that is and that, you know, one obvious answer, we don't pretend to have perfect wisdom on this, is, but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So, prices went up much more than 2 percent per year for a couple of years and people are going to the store and they're paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago, three years ago, and they're not happy about it. And it's fine that inflation is coming down, but the prices are paying are still high. So that is what that has to be some part of why people are unhappy and they're right to be unhappy. You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It's why we need to do our jobs is so that people don't have to deal with things like this. In terms of it, you're right, in recent surveys, a couple of, you've seen a couple of significant increases in consumer confidence or happiness with the economy. I guess that's a good thing. That can support spending, can support economic activity. There's some evidence of that. But you're right, it is the fact that we have seen a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they've been at various times, but they certainly have come up. Thank you for taking our questions. Brian Manistino in business. Any members have said they like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data subject to large revisions, the issue with seasonal adjustments, being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So did any members say they learned anything, not you reflected in the data, or have you yourself or anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn't been captured in the data yet? Well, yes. I'm a big believer that yes. So we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like you, I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies, individual companies, individual management teams, and then building out from that. And so starting with GDP data is, and working into what's actually affecting people's lives is challenging. It's very hard. So I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 reserve banks have really the best network of anyone, that in all their districts, they're talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back, that's what goes into the beige book. But that they come back in what each reserve bank president does is during the outlook go around. They'll say in my district, and they'll talk about 100 conversations, they won't talk up. They will give you input based on 100 conversations that they've had with people of all different walks. And I personally find it very helpful in understanding what's going on. And also I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. Did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they've heard from like their district? Yes. If you look back, the last, not this beige book, but the one before, it was more, it was a lot of slower activity. I think that what you're hearing now is things are picking up a bit. You're hearing not in every district and not every person that we talk to, but you're overall, it feels like you're hearing things picking up at the margin. So that's what comes through. Good, Jeff Cox for the last question. Thank you, sir. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all together. You talked about basically the economy looking strong with 3.3% annualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might that you're in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong and you're more tilted towards that. And also perhaps are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now that inflation could come back at some point? I'm not so worried about that. It's, again, we've had inflation come down without a slow economy and without important increases in unemployment. And there's no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process if it's going to continue. So I think declining inflation, continued declines in inflation are really the main thing we're looking at. We want the labor market to remain strong too. We don't have a growth mandate. We've got a maximum employment mandate and a price stability mandate. And those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two mandates.
