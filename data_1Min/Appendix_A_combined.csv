2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today, my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizeable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A resurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation. Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. And household spending on goods has moderated, following earlier large gains. In contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals. The recently enacted coronavirus response and relief act will provide additional support. While economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months. Implement fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many industries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity. In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a million jobs, largely from restaurants and bars. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.7% in December, and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels. Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Sending large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2% longer run objective. While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several developments point to an improved outlook for later this year. Only widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic activities. In the meantime, continued observance of social distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. Support from fiscal policy will help households and businesses weather the downturn, as well as limit lasting damage to the economy that could otherwise impede the recovery. In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the economy has proved more resilient than expected in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses. Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will continue to do so. The Fed's response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.",-0.0004887908371533,0.0011900669082061425
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:35:00,2021-01-27 18:40:00," along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Today, we unanimously reaffirmed our statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, as we typically do each January. As we say in that statement, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2%. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time, so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate, until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month, and of agency mortgage-back securities by at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions, and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome-based, and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate, and a higher expected path of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. We have also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury. Although the CARES Act facilities are no longer open to new activity, our other facilities remain in place. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy, and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Gina Celia. I had your panel, Gina Smiley, come in the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that GameStop has had this week. And then, secondarily, you and your colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macro-prudential tools as a first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks, but your macro-prudential tools primarily apply to the banks. I'm wondering what your plan is. If you see some sort of large financial stability risk emanating from the non-bank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search for yield kind of activities, you know, what do you see as the solution there? Thanks. On your first question, I don't want to comment on a particular company or days, market activity, or things like that. It's just not really something that I would typically comment on. In terms of macro-prudential policy tools, so as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always on through the cycle macro-prudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests. And also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital and also resolution planning that we impose on the largest financial institutions. We don't use time-varying tests and tools as some other countries do. And we think it's a good approach because for us to use ones that are always on because we don't really think we'd be...",-0.0003650560232788,0.0010265837852136187

You really asked about non-banks, the non-bank sector. And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly. And while we don't have jurisdiction over many areas in the non-bank sector, other agencies do. And so we do coordinate through the financial stability oversight council and with other agencies who have responsibility for non-bank supervision. And in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far. And the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the pandemic really appeared in the non-bank sector. So that's right now we are engaged in carefully examining, understanding and thinking about what in the non-bank sector will need to be addressed in the next year or so. Thank you. James Politi. F.T. Thank you so much, Michelle and chair Powell. I had a question on fiscal policy. Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support. And I believe we're pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December. We now have a new president and new Congress. We have a weekening short-term outlook. Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas? Thank you. So I guess I'd start by saying that the fiscal response that we've seen to this downturn has been strong. And I think we can say now that it's been sustained after the passage of the most recent act in late December. And that's really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it's been. When we look back on the history of this period, we'll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response. I would add that we're, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery. Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That's as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the global financial crisis in the Great Recession. Many small businesses are under pressure and their other needs to be addressed. And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain. So all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the administration and not for the Fed. And these discussions are going on right now. So there's a discussion, as you know, right now around around those precise questions. And that's appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies. Thank you. Steve Leesman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if I could follow up on Gina's question here. I understand that you do address issues of evaluations through macroprudential policies in the first instance, but there's a range of assets. And I know you do watch a range of assets. But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific media or rises and stocks like Game Stock. How do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy as the purchase and zero interest rates are potentially fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should at first. Let me, let me provide a little context. The shock that from the pandemic was unprecedented, both in its nature and in its size. And in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity, there's nothing close to it in our modern economic history. So our response was really to that. And we've done what we could first to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief then to support the recovery and hopefully we'll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer run damage to the to the economy. Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability. So in a world where almost a year later, we're still nine million jobs at least. That's one way of counting. It can actually be counted much higher than that. Short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor force. The real unemployment rate is close to 10% if you include people that's the labor force. It's very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2% and averaging 2% over time. So on matters of financial stability, we have a framework. We don't look at one thing or two things we look at. And we made that framework public after them.",-0.0015337423312884,0.0017744583929233963
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:45:00,2021-01-27 18:50:00," financial crisis so that it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable. And you know, the things that we look at are we do look at asset prices. We also look at leverage in the banking system. We look at leverage in the non-banking system, which is to say corporates and households. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at across that range of readings, they're each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial stability, vulnerabilities overall are moderate. Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to shocks of all kinds. That it's strong and resilient. And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and all different kinds of non-bank financial structures as well. So when we get to the non-financial sector, we don't have jurisdiction over that, but so I would just say that our, there are many things that go in, as you know, to sitting asset prices. So if you look at where it's really been driving asset prices really in the last couple of months, it isn't monetary policy. It's been expectations about vaccines. And it's also financial, sorry, fiscal policy. Those are the news items that have been driving asset purchases, sorry, asset values in recent months. So I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that's how we look at it. And I think that the connection between low interest rates and asset values is probably something that's not as tight as people think because a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time. Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don't mind? Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit, the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values? So you know, that's, as you know, that's one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy. And we don't rule it out as a theoretical matter. But we clearly look to macro potential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in addressing financial stability issues. It's not, you know, the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well understood channels. And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability. That will mean strong, you know, well capitalized institutions and households will be working. And so we know that we don't actually understand the trade off between the sense of it is, would you, if you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, what will that even help? Will it actually cause more damage or will it help? So I think that's unresolved and I think it's something we look at as not theoretically ruled out, but not something we've ever done. And not something we plan to do. We would rely on macro potential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Michael Derby. Yeah, thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, if there is a near term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it's something that's temporary or more enduring? And how much inflation is the Fed will depower right before it acts to restrain price pressures? So on inflation, a couple of things, there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 months basis and as we, as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we'll see measured 12 month inflation move up a few tens. This is just, they're called base effects and that's a transient thing that we think will pass. There's also the possibility, indeed, it's in some forecasts that as the economy fully reopens, there'll be a burst of spending and that because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over potentially and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation. Now again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In both cases, we don't see those either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react is we're going to be patient, expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review as",0.0001856560199163,0.0010596587898696016
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:50:00,2021-01-27 18:55:00," very likely to be transient effects on inflation. I think if you, you know, it helps to look back at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades. And notice that there has been, you know, a significant disinflationary pressure for some time for a couple of decades. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century. And the inflation dynamics with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation is very much intact. Those things, they change over time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don't change rapidly. So we think it's very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation. Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that. It's far harder to deal with, with too low inflation. We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we would have those tools. And we don't expect to see that at all. In terms of how much, you know, what we've said is we'd like to see because inflation has been running persistently. Below 2 percent, we'd like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time. We have not adopted a formula. We're not going to adopt a formula. We're going to, we use policy rules and formulas and everything we do, consult them constantly. But we don't set policy by them. We don't do that. And so we're going to preserve an element of judgment. And again, we'll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we'll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent, the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it. And so that's what we're planning on doing. Thank you, Rachel Siegel. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I have a two-pronged question about vaccines. So you specifically mentioned progress in the rollout of vaccines. But there is still plenty that we don't know about supply over the coming weeks and months. So I'm curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in vaccine rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecast and what that timeline looks like. And then secondly, I'm wondering if you yourself and husband have been vaccinated along with other FOMC members. Thank you. So in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right? We see that we're vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently. And it'll take quite a while to get to the numbers that the experts say are required to get the herd immunity. And we think it's going to be a struggle. You'll notice that we said that the pandemic still provides considerable downside risks to the economy. And that's one of the reasons why is that is the slowness of the rollout. The other reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains. We don't know how to model that. We can have a base case, but we realize no one knows how this new vaccine will roll out, how successful it will be, how high we'll be able to drive vaccination and those sorts of things. We have a base case, but we always look at the range of possibilities. In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks. That's really what we do is we said policies so that we're going to be able to do that. We have remained accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook in the data. So that's how we think about that. And I would also add, there's nothing more important to the economy now than people getting vaccinated. If you think about the places where the economy is weak, I mentioned bars and restaurants. That's 400,000 jobs we lost last month. And that's all because of the spread of the pandemic. Many other areas of the economy, actually, there was actually job creation in goods production and in some service parts industries as well. But we're just not going to be able to get that last group of people back to work. It's a big group of people until we get the pandemic behind us. We have not won this yet. We haven't succeeded in doing this yet. And we need to stay focused on it as a country and get there. We clearly can, but we're going to have to stay focused. And that includes us at the Fed, monetary policy. I have been vaccinated once and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon. Thank you. Thank you.

2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:55:00,2021-01-27 19:00:00," I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential. And that is you have one tool you can use. Would you be discussing, have you discussed raising margin requirements under regulation T and if not, why not? No, we haven't done that. I mean, remember, we're focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it, the broad financial sector. And that's that's that's not, you know, over the years we we consult the fact that we have that authority, but no, it's not something we're looking at right now at all. My follow up question is a lot of people in the markets think that you're basically stuck right now because you can't really go lower with the zero bound rejecting negative interest rates. And you can't really go higher because of the threat of a taper tantrum is if I locked into a very narrow corridor now. And if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead, but New York Fed president Bill Dudley says there's no way you can avoid a taper tantrum. So how do you do that? Well, first, we think our policy stance is is just right. We think it's providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. We adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August. It's September. We implemented rate guidance that was consistent with and based on that new framework in December. We did the same for asset purchases. So we now have, you know, strong guidance on on rates and on asset purchases that's providing very strong support for economic activity. If you look at the sectors of the economy that are inter-sensitive, you will see very strong activity housing, durable goods, automobile sales. So, you know, our policies are working and we think that they are, we think our policy stance is right. That said, there's clearly more that we can do with asset purchases, for example. We can, you know, that's a tool we can do more, we can strengthen our guidance to if we were to think that that were appropriate. What you see is an economy where what's holding it back is not the lack of policy support from the Fed. It's the pandemic. It's the spread of the disease and people's reluctance or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a meaningful part of the economy. So that's what I would say. We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we're in the right place. You know, in terms of tapering, it's just premature. We just created the guidance. We said we want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our asset purchase guidance. It's just too early to be talking about dates, which we should be focused on on progress. It will need to see actual progress. And when we see ourselves getting to that point, we'll communicate clearly about it to the to the public. So nobody will be surprised when the time comes and we'll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual taper. If I might, you took your policies are working and you can maybe do more, but the question is, can you stop doing it when it's time? Yeah, so, you know, I was here. We had all the same questions back in in after the global financial crisis. We raised interest rates. We froze the balance sheet size and then we shrank the balance sheet size. So there's no reason why we won't be able to do that. Again, in fact, we learned a lot from that experience. And, you know, we understand as we understood then, but even more so, we understand that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance to do predictable things and to move gradually. And that's what we're going to do. We're going to be very transparent. But honestly, no, you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say. We're focused on finishing the job we're doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs. There are people out there who've lost their jobs. It's essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible. And we want to do everything we can to do that. And that is our primary focus right now. It's too soon to be worried about that. You know, when it when we come to exit, we have a we have an understanding of how to do that and we'll do it very carefully. But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs. Thank you, Victoria Guida. Hi, chair, pale. I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a second. You know, we just had a $900 billion package and now Congress is talking about doing more. Do you expect.",-0.0014816774705648,0.002453320602588464

I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world, look in Western Europe, look at Japan, around the world, large economies have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals for some time now. That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in, and we believe that those global forces, which are aging demographics, advancing technology and globalization. Those forces are still in effect. Now, they may slow down, and it's an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse. Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the United States have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for a long time. We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over time, but significant time. These things are changing, but they do not change at a rapid rate. I am much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people's careers and lives that they built because they do not get back to work in time and things like that. I am more concerned about that, and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy. I am more concerned about that than about the possibility which exists of higher inflation. Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems far away and unlikely in the both domestic and global contexts that we have been in for some time. Thank you. Steve Matthews, Bloomberg. Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen in a memo to her employees yesterday spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve. I am wondering how you would describe the relationship with Treasury under Chair Yellen, and if you have met with Treasury Secretary Yellen and or President Biden since he has taken office. Secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was constant criticism from the Fed, from the President, and from other officials of the administration. Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of a hands-off attitude in terms of committing on monetary policy from the administration? Okay, so I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen, and I'm sure that we're going to have a good working relationship together. Absolutely sure. We'll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury, and I expect that that'll be very good and very productive. It'll be collaborative. We'll work together. Now, the way that works is that we know the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world. We know to stay in our lanes. We know we have different authorities. We know that we work together on some things to, you know, for the benefit of the public, and I'm absolutely sure that we're going to do that. I haven't spoken to Secretary Yellen. I'm going to be calling her Chair Yellen most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me. Secretary Yellen, I haven't spoken to her since I congratulated on being nominated. I do expect very soon to begin our regular calls and ultimately meetings, which have gone on really for, you know, 70 years, the Treasury Secretary and the Fed share have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls depending on the situation. So I expect that will happen soon. I have not met the President Biden, and just, you know, I don't have any comment on your last question. I wouldn't want to comment one way or the other. I think it's just to follow up briefly.",0.0008018230477756,0.002226227075161751
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 19:05:00,2021-01-27 19:10:00," So some 13, three emergency programs that will expire March 31, the Fed and the Treasury have worked on together. Do you have an expectation of whether those will be left to expire then or whether they will be extended? So I'll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments. And I believe, say, protected the loss of millions of jobs. We're going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout the economy. And if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available. Now, I've had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven't had any discussions with anybody at Treasury, other than high level meetings with the transition team month or so ago. And once we start having those meetings, of course, I'll observe the longstanding practice of not talking about confidential discussions. But as of now, there have been many discussions at all. Thank you. Howard Schneider, Reuters. Thanks, Chair Powell for doing this. So a couple of questions on timing. In this statement, you removed the, regarding the coronavirus, you removed the time reference short-em meeting in term. When it comes to the risks to the economic outlook, it simply now says considerable risk to the economic outlook. Should we read that as a sort of a positive change that you now see in it, at the end game of this down the road? Or is it more that you're worried it could last longer than you expect? And related issue, have you given any guidance yet to the Fed staff or system on when the Fed itself might resume in person events? Yeah, so in the statement on the language, we dropped in the medium term because really the risks are in the near term, frankly. As I mentioned, it's the rollout of the vaccine. It's the arrival of new strains that are more contagious and perhaps more virulent. And those are those are the, and also just the ongoing third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus. It's in the near term. It's not in the medium term. We were thinking when we're thinking medium term, we were thinking of longer term scarring and things like that. Nonetheless, I mean, I think what to go to your second question. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there's good evidence to support a stronger economy in the second half of this year. In fact, if you look at, as we do, look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in December and what's their forecast now, right across the board, much higher forecast for 2021 growth. And that's because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines, and also because of fiscal policy expectations and the reality of the CRRA Act getting done. So there is a positive case there. But think of that as this sort of base case is a strong economy in the second half of the year. The language says that there's still, I forget the exact language, downside risks. We used an adjective. It was considerable, considerable risks of the economic outlook. So there are considerable risks of the economic outlook. Nonetheless, that is a more positive outlook. And that's really how I would parse that for you. Don't know when we're going to come back to work. And I'm actually in the Eccles building here today. And I don't know when that'll be. I mean, I can't wait to be working in person again. But we've been able to work successfully remotely. We really have. And we're not going to push people when they're uncomfortable. We're going to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it's well and truly time to get back together in person. Thank you. Hannah Lang. Hi, Sherry Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. The Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and sharey purchases. And so I wanted to ask what factors the Fed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay out in the second quarter. And when we can expect such a decision. Okay. So we're monitoring that on an ongoing basis. We're continuing to evaluate our restrictions. And we haven't made a decision about whether to continue them in the second quarter or not. We're just going to look at bank result. We're going to look at the whole range of information, including economic activity, banking activity, the success in vaccination. All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question.",-0.0003971300733366,0.001484820363250702
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 19:10:00,2021-01-27 19:15:00," I think we've been careful about rolling back those restrictions. And I'm pleased with where we are. Let's remember that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves, very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital. They've actually had higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here. But we're going to be careful about this and move based on data and all of the data when we make that decision. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question. I'm interested in the housing sector. No prices are rising, a 9% in some areas because of low interest rates. Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet? And is there a price increase that you're looking at where it might change the level of mortgage-backed securities that Fed is buying? And as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning for you? So on housing, housing is now the level of the housing activity is at its highest level since before the global financial crisis in some measures. So you've had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the tightness in housing markets, we think, which has led to the significant price increases this year, we think is a passing phenomenon. There was a lot of pent-up demand. There's a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house and they're thinking, either, I need a bigger house or I need another house and a different house. For a second house, in some cases, there's a one-time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied, also that we'll call for its supply and that we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for all of those reasons. So you asked about corporate debt, I guess. It's the disconcerter that's a bubble that you're watching. So we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully. And what's happened in the corporate debt market, beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been you've seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing, you've seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we expected. There were a lot of downgrades in some defaults at the beginning and those have really slowed down. And by the way, the same is true for bank loans. These are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic. It's just not materializing. So they're having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually. Corporate debt spreads are tight. They've tightened. They were very wide, of course, during the acute phase of the pandemic. They're now at the lower end of their typical range. And we do monitor that. It's not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do watch those things. And in a sense, it's good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period because they've been able to stay in business. They've been able to keep their employees working. And that's a good thing. And that's part of highly accommodative financial conditions. Thanks. Chris Ruggaber. Thanks. Can you, since you suggested that the concern from the pandemic is perhaps a shorter term concern, and that's why you remove some of the language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you're seeing so far? Do you feel that structural impacts have been, how would you characterize those? I know that's been a major concern. You've talked about it, this press conference and others. Do we see longer term damage to the job market or has there been some success in preventing that and compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here in terms of things like permanent job laws, and workers that need to shift industries, that kind of thing? You know, the big thing is that the jury's out. This has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job that they used to work in, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers. The same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don't have the kind of resources that you need to get through this.",5.296750443613087e-05,0.0007417022065641429
2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 19:15:00,2021-01-27 19:20:00," We've had a big concern about both of those. We haven't seen as much of it as we feared, and that's a good thing. But as I said, the jury is out here. Nine or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic. They're a big chunk of them are people who worked in public facing jobs in the service sector. And they've gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy. But the question is getting them back to work and it's harder if it takes longer empirically to find that next job if you're looking in a brand new industry. It's not easy to change careers completely mid-career. So that just again stresses the urgency that we feel and others feel at fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the job and getting back to a place where it's safe to stay in hotels to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters and all of those things. So those people are still at risk and we're very, very focused on that group of people with our policy and the way we look at the economy. So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic. We talked about that at the beginning. For many people, it's clear that they've made it across and their job is okay and their house is okay. And it's been terribly inconvenient and painful and schools are closing things like that. But there's a bunch of people yet who haven't found that bridge yet and we're very focused on that. The thing is we're going to a different economy and we're going to be learning more about that as we go. But clearly we're learning that things can be done for remote locations. We're learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought and some of that is happening. So I think as we get into this, the phase after even after the economy fully reopens, I think we're still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted because they've lost the work that they did. And I think it would be wise as a country for the longer-run productive capacity of the country if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force, even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time. Great. If I could ask this quick follow. Yesterday Susan Rice at the Nested Policy Advisor at the White House, the city group study had said closing racial economic gaps could end up to 5 trillion to the newest economy over the next five years and 6 million new jobs. Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy? And if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in incoming wealth, including potentially the regulatory policy? I strongly agree with that as a matter of fact. I think if you look at either look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homoing gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors, you will see that they're persistent and they're very difficult to explain. So the reason we talk about inequality and racial inequality in particular is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which links up with we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be. We want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody can put their labor in and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy. That's what we want. That's how the U.S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster is if we can achieve a more broader prosperity. So now in terms of our tools, of course that project that I just mentioned is one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play. And that is how we think about the labor market. And so, principally, when we say that the maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal, what we're saying there is we're not just going to look at the headline and we never did really, but we're not going to just look at the headline numbers. We're going to look at different demographic groups, including women, minorities and others, and we're not going to say that we've reached maximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we've reached maximum employment. And you haven't, if there's lots of pockets of people not participating in or not.",-0.0030985169491525,0.003393271384651324

You know, we do, we have such a focus on these issues now that we actually, we have a web page relatively new where we, where you can access all of it. But it's a lot of activities in our division of consumer and community affairs. It's lots of research. And, and it's also, you know, our enforcement of fair lending laws and things like that. So I think everybody's got a role to play here. It's a, it's a national goal and a national job. And we're just going to do our part of the job. And it's something we're strongly committed to. Thank you for the last question. We'll go to Scott Horsley and MPR. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. You said in your opening remarks that the, the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than than people expected. In fact, it affected the adaptability of both households and businesses. Are there adaptations that caught you by surprise? Maybe related to remote work or new ways to do onsite work in person face to face work. But the economy's proven tougher than you expected the outside of the pandemic. Well, yes. So I think if you go back to the, to the beginning, there was a real concern. I mean, just, just take the financial markets. For example, suddenly all of those big buildings all over the, the New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything. Everybody had to go home and they had to take their terminals with them. And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under historically difficult conditions. And yet it worked out okay. So I think people, many people in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading floors or on virtual trading floors. Now some of that's reversing now, but we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home. In many, many different lines of work. Of course, that's not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services for many people. It's not possible. And that's very much something that skews to higher income, higher educated people being able to work from home and others not so much. So I think we've learned that the other thing though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the south and the west, the wave of cases this summer. I think intuitively, having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity. And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and dealt with it. And it didn't actually, it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected. Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger, very, very large wave as was very much forecast. People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that. And even there, if you look at, I would say look at the December jobs report. So big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector. So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants. It's another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities. But if you go, if you look elsewhere, it's not having an effect, you know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly, really directly exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, they're doing okay. They are. Housing is a great example. You know, the way, the way the way the housing industry worked, when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact. They managed to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual, you know, with all of the technology. They were able to completely avoid that and the housing market's been really strong, notwithstanding that it's, it's now quite virtual rather than in person. So there's been a lot of adapting and, but you can't adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars. You just, you know, those are just going to, and that's, that's again, that's, that's millions and millions of people. And so you're just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which as I mentioned, you know, we have a plan to do that, but we haven't done it yet. And we need to, we need to finish the job. And we, it's within our power to do that as a country this year. And I would just urge that, and I know people are working hard on that, but that, that is really the main thing about the economy is, is getting the pandemic under control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks and all that. But that's the single most important economic growth policy that we can have. Thank you.",0.0002523676066252,0.001542184051689864
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:35:00," Good afternoon. I would like to start by noting that it has been a full year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores. Looking back, it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of healthcare providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice. The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear. Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any post-war economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, healthcare providers, and state and local governments. Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief and stability to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible and to limit lasting damage to the economy. We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action, from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the country. More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions. And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent. At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. Since January, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. In the meantime, continued observance of social distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain. Following the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak. Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year. In contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due, importantly, to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses, and communities. The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up notably since our December summary of economic projections. In commenting on the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations, as well as recent fiscal policy. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently. Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December in January. Nonetheless, employment in this sector is more than three million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February. This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline. The median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year, and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on, all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe-",0.0003668285772111,0.0015693818660456754
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:35:00,2021-03-17 18:40:00," for lower wage workers in the service sector and for African-Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. Overall inflation remains below our 2% longer on objective. Over the next few months, 12 month measures of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and April of last year fall out of the calculation. Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen. Particularly if supply belt bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation. The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4% this year and declines to 2% next year before moving back up by the end of 2023. The Fed's response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the financial the stability of the financial system. As we say in our statement on longer run goals in monetary policy strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well-anchored at 2%. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement with inflation running persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1.25% target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2% as seems likely to occur this year would not meet this standard. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate along with our balance sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. Our guidance is outcome-based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Howard for Reuters. Hi, Chair Powell. And thanks for that. So could you talk us through how the forecast for 2021 map into the substantial further progress definition, you know, 2.4% of inflation, I understand that's considered transitory. That still seems like some progress there, 4.5% unemployment. Is it time to start talking about, talking about tapering yet? Not yet. So as you pointed out, we've said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And that's actual progress, not forecast progress. So, and that's a difference from our past approach. So, and what we mean by that is is pretty straightforward. It is, we'll want to see that the labor markets have moved, labor market conditions have moved, you know, have made...",0.0029588791664558,0.0030600374285569255
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:40:00,2021-03-17 18:45:00," substantial progress toward maximum employment and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2% goal. That's what we're going to want to see. Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see, we'll be carefully looking ahead. We also understand that we will want to provide as much advanced notice of any potential taper as possible. So when we see that we're on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we're on track to perhaps achieve substantial for their progress, then we'll say so. And we'll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper. If I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots, why wouldn't that suggest a weakening of the commitment here? I know a whole lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems. I don't see that at all. We have a range of perspectives on the committee. I welcome that. And we have, we debate things, we discuss things, and we always come together around a solution. But the strong bulk of the committee is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period. And as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecast to move up. It's probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for a lift off. Nonetheless, the bulk of the committee, the largest part by far of the committee, is doesn't show a rate increase during this period. And again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point. We do expect that we'll begin to make faster progress on both spending labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we're getting. We expect that to happen, but we'll have to see it first. Great. Thank you. Victoria. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio. There's been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this month, which I'm happy to hear an update if you have one. But just sort of more broadly, do you think long term that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large? And if so, do you think that changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem? Victoria, we'll have something to announce on that in coming days. And I'm not going to expound upon your questions. Why don't you ask another question if you'd like to? Because that one I'm just going to say that works something in coming days. Sure. OK. Well, then I'll ask about unemployment. You know, the unemployment rate is you all have projections for the U6 rate, but you've also been really emphasizing the fact that that's not the only thing that you all are looking at. You're also looking at labor force participation and things like that. So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you're projecting the unemployment rate to the summary of economic projections? Well, let me say, as we say in our statement, our longer-run goals in monetary policy strategy, we look to a range of indicators on labor market. We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of labor market outcomes that's in the SEP. We look at a very broad range. You hear us talk all the time about participation, about employment to population, which is the combination of the two, about different measures of unemployment. So it wages. It's the job flows. It's all of those things. They go into an assessment disparities of various groups. All that goes into an assessment of maximum employment. The trying to incorporate all of that into the summary of economic projections would not be practical. Obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that's a very insufficient statistic. So it doesn't include a lot of other things that we do look at. And I wouldn't want to say that we're looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP. But from time to time, we do look at adding different things. But I would just say the SEP is a summary. It's one device. It's not going to include all of the things that we look at. I think you know the things that we look at, which we talk about them all the time. So we're not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now. Thank you. Chris Ruggabur, Associate of Press. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask if I have the forecast overall. You're forecasting.",0.0026475705388436,0.0030010339696871727
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:45:00,2021-03-17 18:50:00," So, very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation or the Fed overall is in the SEP forecasting inflation at or above 2% by 2023. I get no rate hike in any of this forecast horizon. So, is this telling us that you see a higher inflation rate than what's projected or do not, as you've been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient or what is this telling us about the Fed's reaction function that it seems you're meeting the Fed's dual mandate by 2023. Yet again, no rate hike expect. So I guess the first thing to say is that the SEP is not a committee forecast. It's not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve and say this represents our reaction function as a committee. It's a compilation of projections from different people. Since we don't debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say exactly why each participant did what they were going to do. So all I would say about this is that we laid out what I think is very clear guidance on lift-off. And it's really three things. Labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment. And as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate. Inflation that has reached 2% and not just on a transitory basis. And inflation is on track to run moderately above 2% for some time. The first two of those three are very much database. The third does have a little bit of an element of expectations in it. So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way. It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework. And to meet these standards, we'll need to see data, as I mentioned. So what does this SEP really say? It says that we're committed to our framework and to the guidance we've provided to implement that framework. We will wait until the requirements set forth and that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate. And the last thing I'll say is this. The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain. And I wouldn't want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future. So that's how I would think about the SEP. Thank you. Paul Kiernan. Thank you, Chairman Powell. My question is twofold. One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise? There is some ambiguity in your new target, as you mentioned, expectations driven. And do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely? Is that a concern? Thanks. So we've said we'd like to see inflation run moderately above 2% for some time. And we've resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that. Part of that just is talking about inflation is one thing. Actually having inflation run above 2% is the real thing. So over the years, we've talked about 2% inflation as a global. We haven't achieved it. So I would say we'd like to perform. That's what we'd really like to do is to get inflation moderately above 2%. I don't want to be too specific about what that means because I think it's hard to do that. And we haven't done it yet. When we're actually above 2%, we can do that. I would say this. Fundamental change in our framework is that we're not going to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part. And we're going to wait to see actual data. And I think it will take people time to adjust to that and to adjust to that new practice. And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it. So that's how I would think about that. Thank you. Matthew Bosler. Hi, Chair Powell. This is Matthew Boser with Bloomberg News. So there's widespread presumption at this point that the US will reach herd immunity sometime this year. And all along, you've said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus. I'm curious, based on the projections that you released.",-0.0009179157026456,0.0015358275844705514
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 18:50:00,2021-03-17 18:55:00," that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023. Do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines if you will? Thank you. So on herd immunity, I'm really going to leave that question to the experts. We don't control that. We're not responsible for defining it. And we'll leave that whole discussion to the experts. I mean, what we're focused on is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy. And there we provided very clear guidance. And in the case of asset purchases, it's at their current level until we make substantial further progress. There is an element of judgment in that and therefore will supply clear communication well in advance of actually tapering. And we just went through the criteria for raising interest rates. They're very specific. And we're very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly. I would agree with you that the path of the virus continues to be very important. We have these new strains which can be very quite virulent. And we're not actually done yet. And we're clearly on a good path with cases coming down as I mentioned. But we're not done and I'd hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job. So that's how I would look at that. If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year? But full employment taking longer to achieve. Is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years? Is that how to interpret the forecast? I think there's some of that. Sure, there'll be some of that. There'll still be some social distancing. People may be, for example, going into spaces that involve close contact with others. Some people will do that right away. Others will hold back. And so I think there'll be some of that. In addition, though, remember, there are 10 million people in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work. And it's going to take some time for that to happen. It can happen maybe more quickly than it has in the past because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers. This could be a different sort of a process and it could be quicker. We don't know that. But it's just a lot of people who need to get back to work and it's not going to happen overnight. It would be, it's going to take some time. No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go down. And so will participation. So that's all I can say. I think the faster the better, we'd love to see it come sooner rather than later. We'd welcome nothing more than that. But realistically, given the numbers, it's going to take some time. Thank you. Steve Leesman. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I wonder if you could kind of a three-parter here, but all related. Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and some other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy? And if not, is there a level that would give you concern? And finally, the third part, other central bankers have expressed concern about what's happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action. But not you. Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market? Do you like that idea? Do you not like it? Is it the top of your toolbox or is it something that you think is the top of your toolbox? Sure. So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions. And we're always attentive to market developments, of course. We're still a long way from our goals. And it's important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goals. And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you'll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative. And that is appropriate. So that's how we look at it. I would add, as I've said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals. We think the stance of our monetary policy remains appropriate. Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy. And we're committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly done.",0.0005160218491203,0.001234070417569156

Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don't really prefer? You know, we the tools we have or the tools we have, what I'm telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today we believe is appropriate. We think that our asset purchases in their current form which is to say you know across the curve 80 billion in treasuries 40 billion in mortgage back securities on net. We think that that's that's the right place for our asset purchases now we can we can change them of course in a number of different dimensions should we team at that appropriate but for now we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate. Thank you Rachel Segal. Hi, chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. You've spoken about the pandemics disproportionate tool on black Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and other groups in the labor market. I'm curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans. And relatedly since you've described vaccines as key to the economic recovery is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color and what barriers do you think exists there. Thanks very much. So which measures so we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market disparities in the labor market let's say so the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated. And so is the Hispanic unemployment rate so we look at those and we see those as you know it's it's slack in the labor market it's it's sad to see because those disparities had really come down fair to record lows since we started keeping the data that way as recently as a year ago February of last year we had those those disparities quite low what happens in a downturn though is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment. So we monitor those things we are tools of course affect unemployment generally but we're going to look at those as as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that you know that there's progress there and in this particular downturn of course was just direct hit on on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower paid workers the public facing workers in the service industries. In many cases don't have a lot of financial assets they're not tremendously well paid they might have other jobs and things like that so this was a direct hit on that part of the economy and it's the slowest part of the economy to recover so you know we like to see those people continue to get supported you know as we as the broader economy recovers which which is very much doing now in terms of disparate levels of vaccination that's some. There's a facts unfortunate facts there really not something we we have within our policy. Toolkit to address but it is it is true though that we the data we have suggests that there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and you know but that's that's not for us that's for fiscal authorities and the government were generally to to work on. Thank you Gina Smialik. Hey, Chair Powell thanks for taking our questions and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy's potential in the longer term just in the sense that you've talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our sort of future prospects and I wonder whether you see that sort of working universe you know if we pull people back into the market more quickly just that improve our chances. So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very very concerned about at the beginning and I think that's just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered you know with the CARES Act and since then has is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment. It's going to make a huge difference in people's lives and it has already as I mentioned in my remarks opening remarks the recovery has been faster than we expected part of that just is very hard to predict given we've never seen an event like this but part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response which I think will will look good over the years longer term. You know to really that's it that the first part of is about avoiding school.",0.0004528529737345,0.0011326168483048215
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 19:00:00,2021-03-17 19:05:00," And I think we've not avoided all of the scarring, but we've probably avoided the worst cases there. And I hope we keep at it. We will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that continues. Longer term, though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked to raise living standards over time is investment. Investment in people's skills and aptitudes. Investment in plan and equipment. Investment in software. It takes a lot of investment to support a more productive economy and raise living standards. And that hasn't been the principal focus with these measures, our measures certainly. We don't have those tools, but what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to support people as the economy returns to normal. But there should be a focus on a longer term focus, I think, would be healthy on the investment front. Thank you. James Politi. Thank you, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a question about the eurozone. While the outlook for the US economy has much improved progress in the eurozone has been far less encouraging and it's showing signs of serious weakness due to the slower vaccination roll out and renewed lockdowns and restrictions. How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that trouble in the eurozone and weakness in the eurozone could drag down the US recovery as it did in a way in the aftermath of the financial crisis? You're right. The pace of the recovery is, we're having diverging recoveries here as we did after the last crisis and in this case, as well as the other one, the US recovery is leading the global recovery. And, you know, we conduct policy, of course, here. Our focus is on, you know, our objectives are domestic ones. It's maximum employment and price stability here in the United States. We monitor developments abroad because they know that they can affect our outcomes. So, I think US demand, very strong US demand if, as the economy improves, is going to support global activity as well over time. That'll be through imports and, you know, when the US economy is strong, that strength tends to support global activity as well. So that's one thing. I don't worry in the near term. I mean, I'd love to see Europe going faster. I'd love to see the vaccine roll out going more smoothly. But I don't worry too much about us in the near term because we're on a very good track. Very strong fiscal support coming now, vaccination going quickly and cases coming down. I think we're in a good place. It's all ahead of us, but the data should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here. Thank you. Handling. Hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and sharey purchases that are currently in place into the second quarter. And if you're considering at all the scenario analysis and mid cycle stress tests that were in place last year, this year, and kind of what would make you consider doing something like that again. So we haven't made a decision on that. We're a couple weeks away from announcing that decision. I won't foreshadow it here today. I will say we're going to continue our data driven approach. You know that we restricted by-backs in dividends. We're the firms are preserving capital through 2020. The banks actually increased their level of capital and their level of reserves. And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we use in December, which were quite stringent. We're right in the middle of our 2021 stress test and we'll release those results before the end of June. And that layer is very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year with the unapply rate going to 11% and stock prices falling more than 50%. But all of that, the results of the stress test and the decision on distributions, all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned. Thank you.

2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 19:05:00,2021-03-17 19:10:00," Thanks, Chair Boff, for taking these questions. You laid out the standards to lift off. And back in June of 2020, you said, you're not even thinking about raising rates. But I see seven members seeing lift off in 2023 and four next year. How much debate and how can you characterize that conversation? Has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled? Well, you know, it all depends. We've set out very clear criteria for lift off, right? Where we've said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment. And that doesn't just mean unemployment. It means a much broader set of criteria. We want inflation at 2% and not on a transitory basis. And we want inflation on track to be moderately to run moderately above 2% for something. Those are the three conditions. Everybody on the committee agrees to that, right? So it comes down to what's your projection for the economy. If you want it, people will have a range of assessments for how good the economy is going to be. And I would say that we're in a relatively highly uncertain situation. If you look at the uncertainty, people on the committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is very high compared to the normal level. We haven't come out of a pandemic before. We haven't had this kind of fiscal support before totally and all up. So you're going to have different perspectives from committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will hear how fast. Sorry, inflation will move up. And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of lift off. Of course, this isn't a decision to lift off now. We make that decision then, but it's an estimate based on assumptions about growth. And it's meant to be a tool to generally show the public how our objective function works, how we think about the future. It isn't meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off. We're not going to make that decision for some time. The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it'll be. So sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they're not a committee forecast. You know this, but it's not a committee forecast. It's just compiling these projections really of individual people. We think it serves a useful purpose. It's not meant to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the committee will act. That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Chung. Heather Sherman Powell, I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus. So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even maybe more investment, at least from Congress, to support the more productive economy as you answer to Gina's question. So we just have $1.9 trillion in spending. So what do you see the fiscal space right now? Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right now where it wouldn't be a concern? If there were to be more spending at this time. So Brian, it's not up to us to decide what Congress should spend money on or when I was answering Gina's question, which really was. How do we assure lack of damage to, if scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity economy? And I think what's happened so far has done a pretty good job of that. But really, I wanted to make the longer run point that if to work on the productivity, on productivity over longer periods, that is, that is, comes down to a number of things. But one of those things is investment, investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things. I'm not, in any way, suggesting that that's something Congress should work on right now. Or that, you know, that's just not my, that's not our job. I'm just saying that, that is what, what fiscal policy can do that really monetary policy can't do is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth. Those things are completely tools that Congress has. And again, I wasn't making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting. Thank you. Next to Michael Derby. Thank you for your question. I just wanted to get your, an updated view on your sense of your, your view on financial stability risks. And whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you either, you know, specifically to that, that area of the market, or as in terms of like the threat that it could propose to propose to the overall economy. Or so, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework. It's not one thing. It's not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.",-0.0001884469459031,0.000653496204695096
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 19:10:00,2021-03-17 19:15:00," framework that we have, we report on it semi-annually, the board gets a report on it quarterly, and we monitor every day. And it has four pillars, and those are four key vulnerabilities. Asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions, those four things. And I'll just quickly touch on them. So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history. I think that's clear. In terms of households and businesses, households entered the crisis in very good shape by historical standards. Leveraging the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the financial crisis. Now there was some negative effects on that. People lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they've also gotten a lot of support now. So the damage hasn't been as bad as we thought. This is by the same token, it had a high debt load coming in. But many so-their revenues declined, but they've done so much financing, and there's a lot of cash on their balance sheets. So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out is really troubling. Short-term, I mentioned funding risk as the last one. So we saw, again, in this crisis breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets. It came under tremendous amount of stress. And they've been quiet since the spring, and we shut down our facilities and all that. But we don't feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that those some aspects of the short-term funding markets and more broadly non-bank financial intermediation didn't hold up so well under great stress, under tremendous stress. And we need to go back and look at that. So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back. And this will involve all the other regulatory agencies. It does involve all of them as well, and see if we can strengthen those things. So that's a sort of a broader detailed look. Thank you. Michael McKee. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the SEP and your forecasts? The inflation that you're talking about for this year, say, is transitory. And by 2023, you're back down to 2.1%. There's no forecast for a rate increase for 2023. If you get to 3.5% unemployment, but inflation's only at 2.1%. Are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there, or roughly zero going forward from there? But we be in a jabtand-like situation where rates just stay low because inflation does. Well, again, I wouldn't read too much into the March 2021 SEP dot plot. Remember what it is. It's a compilation of individual projections by individual members. They're all making different assessments. They have different forecasts, economic forecasts. Some have more optimistic ones. Less optimistic. And also remember that the SEP doesn't actually include all the things that go into maximum employment. It's only includes unemployment. So I would just say we've sent out clear guidance. The message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is we sent out clear guidance. I mentioned what it was. It's inflation up to no sorry, it's labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment. And that's not just unemployment. It's all the other indicators. But overall, totaling up to maximum employment. It's inflation at 2% and not on a transient basis. And inflation on track to exceed 2% for moderately for some time. Those are the criteria. We're committed to robustly implementing that guidance. That's what this says. That's really all it says. We're going to wait until those requirements are met. And again, the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain. And I wouldn't want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far in the future. I'd like to follow up. I'm just wondering. Before 2019, I always say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low. How are you saying we're willing to live with it until we reach these goals, even if you get the picture goal on maximum employment? So what I would say is we're committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of",-0.0013819707974165,0.0017872876022655244
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 19:15:00,2021-03-17 19:20:00," maximum employment and price stability. And to the extent having rates low and support from monetary policy broadly to the extent that raises other questions, we think it's absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the broader financial system. And to carefully monitor financial stability questions, if that's what you're getting at, we do that, we monitor them very carefully. I would point out that over the long expansion, longest in US history, 10 years and eight months, rates were very low for, they were at zero for seven years and then never got above 2.4% roughly. During that, we didn't see actually excess buildup of debt. We didn't see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy. We didn't see the things, we didn't see a housing bubble. The things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the US, we didn't see them build up despite very low rates. Part of that just is that you're in a low rate environment. You're in a much lower rate environment and the connection between low rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is. That's not to say we ignore it, we don't ignore it. We watch it very carefully and we don't think there is a connection. I would say there is, but it's not quite so clear. We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully and we didn't do that before the global financial crisis 12 years ago. Now we do and we've also put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system are much stronger, much more resilient. That's true of the banks. I think it's true of the CCP's. We want it to be true of other non-bank financial intermediation markets and institutions. So I think that's, you know, monetary policy should be to me for achieving our macroeconomic aims. Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn't, frankly. And we learned that in 2008, 910, this time around the regulated part of the financial system held up very well. We found some other areas that need strengthening and that's what we're working on now. Thank you. Yanikin, CNN. Thanks for taking my question. Geron Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent and systemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation? Does the former offset the ladder to some degree? I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You broke up there for a second. Oh no, I was hoping that wouldn't happen. Can you hear me now? Yes, yeah. Okay, great. I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation. I'm wondering whether the former offsets the ladder and to which degree you guys are monitoring this. You're asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation? Is that the question? Yes, exactly. Okay. They offset each other, the persistent, systemic unemployment. Yeah. I think I'm hearing you're correctly. So I would say a couple things. There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation. That time is long gone. We had extremely low unemployment and not extremely low. We had low unemployment in 2018 and 19 and the beginning of 20 without having troubling inflation at all. We were 3.5%. We were bouncing around with unemployment, 3.5% to 4%. And it wasn't just unemployment. Participation was high. Wages were moving up. It was a very healthy thing. And we didn't see price inflation move up. There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. But that has not, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices. And that seems to be a feature of late cycle behavior. So we're not, when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data.",-0.0002569458425609,0.0012965107497104535
2021-03-17 18:30:00,2021-03-17 19:20:00,2021-03-17 19:25:00," without worrying too much about inflation. Thank you. Going to Greg Rob. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit. I understand what you're saying about the dot plot and and the message you're trying to send with the dot plot, but does it same apply for the taper tantrum? You've said that it's going to take some time to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like some time could now be any time. So we've said substantial further progress. Now if you go back October November sorry November, December and January progress in the labor market slowed very sharply. So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month. If you go back and look at the the level of job creation before that was very, very high, very high. So we weren't making any progress on the labor market from November through January. February we saw a nice pickup, a good job report, 379,465 private sector. So that's good. It can go so much higher though and it would be nice to see it to really make faster progress. That's different from substantial progress. We'd like to see it be higher than that and I think it will be. That's the expectation is you'll see now I think really strong job creation return, not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but nonetheless very strong. Okay, so what I'm saying is to achieve substantial progress from where we are having had three months of very little progress is going to take some time and it's we don't want to get into. I don't want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace because it's going to be data dependent. When we see ourselves on track to make substantial for their progress, we're going to say so. We understand fully that that test is one that involves judgment. If you remember during the global financial crisis recovery, we said we quantitative easing number three was the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. What does that mean? Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and that we would communicate when we thought we had that. This is just like that in a way. What we're saying is substantial further progress toward our goals. We'll tell people when we think until we until we say until we give us a signal, you can assume we're not there yet. And as we approach it well in advance, well in advance, we will give a signal that yes, we're on a path to possibly achieve that to consider tapering. So that's how we're playing to handle it. It's not different really from QE3. And I think we've learned what we've learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly well in advance and then follow through with with your communications. In this case, it's an outcome based set of guidance as our rate guidance is and it's going to depend on the progress of the economy. That's why it's not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet. Thank you. Thank you. Don Lee. LA Times. Hi, Chair Powell. As you know, households are sitting on a lot of excess savings and I wonder if combined with that, you have an unleashing of pent up demand. How much do you think that would affect that would affect inflation? And would you expect that to be a transitory? We, you know, we, everyone who's forecasting these, what we're all doing is we are looking at the at the amount of savings we were looking at, you know, we have reasonably good data on that and we're looking at the government transfers that will be made as part of the various laws and we're trying to make an assessment on what will be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume. And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring and ultimately on inflation. So that's what we're all doing. And we have, you know, we have, we can look at history and we can make estimates and those are all very transparent and public and you can compare one to the other. And of course, we've all done that. And I think we've made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.

That will be a fairly significant pop in inflation. It will wear off quickly though because just the way the numbers are calculated. Pass that as the economy reopens, people will start spending more and you can only go out to dinner once per night but a lot of people can go out to dinner and so they are not doing that. They are not going to restaurants, not going to theaters. That part of the economy and travel in hotels. That part of the economy is really not functioning at full capacity. But as that happens, people can start to spend. It also wouldn't be surprising if you're seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy. They will be bottlenecks. They won't be able to service all of the demand maybe for a period. So those things could lead to a lot of demand. We've modeled that. Other people have to. What we see is relatively modest increases in inflation. Those are not permanent things. What will happen is the supply side, the supply side in the United States is very dynamic. People start businesses. They reopen restaurants. The airlines are will be flying again. All of those things will happen. So it will turn out to be a one time sort of bulge in prices but it won't change inflation going forward because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2%. We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time. There was a time when inflation went up. It would stay up. That time is not now. That hasn't been the case for some decades. We won't suddenly change to another regime. These things tend to change over time. They tend to change when the central bank doesn't understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2% is the key to it all. Having them anchored at 2% is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy is really weak. If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2% of course we would conduct policy in a way that would make sure that that didn't happen. We are committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2% not materially above or below 2%. If you look at the savings look at all of that model it. That's kind of what comes out of our assessment. There are different possibilities. I think it's a relatively unusual, very unusual situation to have all these savings and this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support. Nonetheless that is our most likely case and as the data come in and the economy performs will of course adjust. Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is. Thank you. We will go to Scott Horsley for the last question. Thanks, Jeremy Powell. My question is about those supply chain bottlenecks especially on the good side. Are they getting better or are they getting worse? We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers that came out yesterday and what do you expect them to do to prices in just in the short run? I think it's been possible to say frankly with any confidence but I would expect it's very possible, let's put it that way, that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time and you will probably see that over a period of time because really the strong data are ahead of us. Right now the checks are going out just now and that will add to spending. COVID cases are coming down. Vaccination is moving now quickly. The really strong economic data is coming. It should be coming assuming we stay on this track and that's when you'll really know where the bottlenecks are. But you can see though that these are not permanent. It's not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things. The market will clear it just may take some time and some of the answer to that may be price. In many cases it won't be price. You'll see that people are reluctant to raise prices. It's a little bit of the story about the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down wages move up but companies choose not to try to pass that price increase along to their customers. You'll see a lot of that here too I think. Anyway we'll see but that's my basic sense. Thank you very much. Nice.",0.0004408726759712,0.0009069837750679149
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizeable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. White spread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery. Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Household spending on goods has risen robustly. The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also increased. Spending on services has also picked up, including at restaurants and bars. More generally, the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have shown improvement. While the recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it remains uneven and far from complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and the measures undertaken to control its spread. Since March, progress on vaccinations has limited the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. While the level of new cases remains concerning, especially as it reflects the spread of more infectious strains of the virus, continued vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year. In the meantime, continued observance of public health and safety guidance will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Employment rose 916,000 in March, as the leisure and hospitality sector posted a notable gain for the second consecutive month. Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic. For the economy as a whole, payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6% in March, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. Readings on inflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating. In the near term, 12 month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2%, as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also likely to see upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on inflation. The Fed's response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As we say in our statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer term inflation expectations well anchored at 2%. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time, so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-214% target range for the federal funds rate. Until we...",-0.0002427745830813,0.0011265310035714084
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:35:00,2021-04-28 18:40:00," The labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. I would note that a transitory rise in inflation above 2% this year would not meet as standard. In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-back securities by at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. The economy is a long way from our goals and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals. This outcome-based guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, we'll go to Paul Kiernan. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for doing this. I guess since I'm first, I'll go ahead and re-appower this question from the last press conference. Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet? Have you and your colleagues had any conversations? Those affect? Thanks. Thank you. So no, it is not time yet. We've said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation. And we said we'd do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases and we will do so. In the meantime, we'll be monitoring progress toward our goals. We first articulated this substantial further progress test at our December meeting. Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter. And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. John L. that borders. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much. My question is about what's going on with the virus and what if we don't reach a level of herd immunity per se? So in your scenarios thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have a model where you might start to still normalize policy even if there's like a baseline of infection still going on or how can you talk about how you're weighing those things? Yeah. So we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts. But I would certainly say that what matters the most of the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus. Economy can't fully recover until people are confident that it's safe to resume activities involving crowds of people. There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won't come back in unless they feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example. And there may be parts of the economy that will just won't be able to really fully re-engage until the pandemic is decisively behind us. We've articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates. So for asset purchases, we've said that we would continue with the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals. And that is what it is, substantial further progress. For interest rates, as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment. We want to see inflation at 2%, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2%. So those are our tests. We don't have an independent test to do with the virus. I will say, though, as I started with, you know, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests. Great. Thank you. Gina. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated. You've obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move. But I guess I wonder what happens if it's",0.0025025744186603,0.0028498544176815584
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:40:00,2021-04-28 18:45:00," inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employment. You know, it seems like a lot of sort of this stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable. And I guess I wonder how your reaction would be, or a sort of how your reaction to that is, is how do you think you about that? Right. So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market. I won't say that it's impossible, but it seems unlikely. It's much more likely that we would having achieved maximum employment conditions, we'd also be seeing 2% inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2%. They tend to move together. So that's not to say inflation might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to, that would take some time. And you would think that it would be quite likely that we'd be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening. If that actually were to happen, though, there is a paragraph in the statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the time it would take to get back and forth. So we do, it doesn't really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them. Were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state? Thank you, Steve, Niceman. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Janelle's question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better. You're thinking about how COVID infection rates in the virus calibrate with monetary policy. As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall. I'm wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn't such a resurgence coming before you began? I mean, for lack of a better term, thinking about, thinking about capering. And what kind of comfort level would you need? Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization, for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic before you had the comfort level to reverse course on policy? Thank you. We really have, or just articulated the goals that I've just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial for their progress toward our goals before we taper. Now, that's very likely for us to achieve that. It's very likely going to be the case that we've also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and other. Those two things should more or less coexist. We haven't articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we'd like to achieve, because we're not experts in that area. We're really focused on the economic outcomes. And again, my guess is that we, it's very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates. We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control. Not necessarily fully under control. There is a possibility, of course, that we will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer of various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter as well. But we'll be looking for substantial progress toward our goals, substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases. Thank you. Thank you. Victoria. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you've talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there's not long-term scarring in the economy. And I was just wondering, given all the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long-term scarring? And if so, what are you most worried about? Where are you most worried about that showing up? So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of the labor market for an extended period of time. The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult. You're out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had. Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations, where we're going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily. That was a big concern. I would say that so far, here we are in late April of 2021, we haven't experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses. So we're not living that downside case that we're very concerned about a year ago. Notwithstanding that, we're a long way from full employment. The labor jobs are 8.4 million.",0.0003738474033729,0.0006211476898083781

So we've been hearing a lot from companies that they are, they've been looking at deploying better technology, perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people. You know, it may well be, it seems quite likely that a number of the people who had those service sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had. These were people who were working in February of 2020. They clearly want to work. So those people are going to need help. And so while I would say we haven't seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for, you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we've still got a lot of people out of work. We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible. And that's really one of the things we're trying to achieve with our policy. Thank you, Rachel Siegel. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you to your panel for taking our questions. The housing market in many American cities, the scene, booming prices, bidding wars, and all cash offers well above asking price. And this is happening at the same time that housing is becoming much more expensive for lower income Americans and people who are still struggling from the pandemic. Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles or that there's the potential for that? And what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this? Thank you. So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course. And I would say that before the pandemic, it's a very different housing market than it was before the global financial crisis. And one of the main differences was that households were in very good shape financially compared to where they were in addition. Most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores. There wasn't the subprime low-doc, no-doc lending practices were not there. So we don't have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are over-levered and owning a lot of houses. There's no question though that housing prices are going up. And so we're watching that carefully. It's partly because there's clearly strong demand. And there's just not a lot of supply right now. So builders are struggling to keep up with the demand clearly. Inventories are tremendously low. We're all hearing those stories. And if you're an entry-level housing buyer, this is a problem because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house and that's a problem. I mean, it's part of a strong economy with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing. So in that sense, it's good. It's clearly the strongest housing market that we've seen since the global financial crisis. And my hope would be that over time, housing builders can react to this demand and come up with more supply. And workers will come back to work in that industry. So it's not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much and we're watching it very carefully. I don't see the kind of financial stability concerns though that really do reside around the housing sector. So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing. We really don't see that here. We don't see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing. Thank you. Chris Rougaber, Associated Press. Hi, I'm taking my question. I wanted to ask about the labor market. I'm going to ask you a question. Do you see things such as in the beige book, you saw in the beige book, anecdotes about businesses, not able to find worker. You're back to the labor market for fear of getting sick. Child care concerns and so forth. Do you see these as also just sort of temporary bottlenecks that won't have much effect on the long term health of the labor market? How are you thinking about these kinds of issues? Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question. So I think there are a number of things going on there. The tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can't find an elevate number of companies saying they can't find workers. So what's really going on there? It should be a number of different things. They're workers who don't actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for. So there are some difficult differences. It may also be that, for example, one big factor would be schools aren't open yet, so there's still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce. But can't be yet. There are people afraid of their virus fears that are weighing on people. So it's some...",-0.0008119015211213,0.0015776263893868007
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:50:00,2021-04-28 18:55:00," people don't want to go back to work. They're also a significant number of people who say they've retired. A large number of people say that they're retired. Now, it's hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID becomes in the rearview mirror in the history books, if you will. But clearly there's something going on out there as many companies are reporting labor shortages. We don't see wages moving up yet and presumably we would see that in a real, you know, in a really tight labor market and we may well start to see that. I do think so what will happen? What we saw during the last expansion and maybe a different expansion we don't know, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up. In other words, if you were worried about their, about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did. You know, the labor force participation held up. People came in the labor force. They stayed in the labor force longer than expected. So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force and these jobs will be. The labor market will reach equilibrium. Maybe pay will go up. But I do think that, and I do think also the unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September. So to the extent that's a factor, which is not clear. It will no longer be a factor fairly, a factor fairly soon. So my guess is that we'll come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand. It may take some months though. Thank you. Heather Scott. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Chris. We lost you, Chris. Let's go on to Heather. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you know you've been hearing, of course, these concerns raised by Larry Summers and others about inflation. And the fact that they think the Fed might be might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance. So my question is, can you tell us what is different this time versus previous periods like in the 60s when inflation got out of control? Why are you confident with the lags and monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and make sure it doesn't go too far above the 2% target? Thank you. So actually I have a couple of things I'd like to say about inflation, including addressing your question. So let me start with just saying that we're very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum permanent employment and price stability. Our price stability goal is 2% inflation over the longer run. And we believe that having inflation average 2% over time will help anchor long term inflation expectations at 2% with inflation having a persistently below 2% for some time. The Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for 2% for some time. So with a little bit of context, we're making our way through an unprecedented series of events really in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies many places around the world. In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support. Vaccinations are now widespread and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum. During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices and I'll discuss why. But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process. In an episode of one time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as and is not likely to lead to persistently higher year over year inflation into the future inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2% inflation over time. Indeed, it is the Fed's job to make sure that that does not happen. If contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2% in a matter that threatened to move longer term inflation expectations materially above 2%, we would use our tools to bring inflation and expectations down to mandate consistent levels. I would say if I may, that is a principle difference from we are all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and 70s of course. We know that our job is to achieve 2% inflation over time. We are committed to that and we will use our tools to do that. That is a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s. Many, many differences actually. So let me talk quickly about the two reasons, two or you could say three but really two main reasons why we think inflation.",0.0002151000215099,0.0005521560378621153
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 18:55:00,2021-04-28 19:00:00," will move up in the near term. The first is the base effects. Twelve month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2% over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April last year drop out of the calculation. That process has already started to show up. You saw it in the March CPI reading and you'll see it later this week in the PCE price data. These base effects will contribute about one percentage point to headline inflation and about seven tenths of a percentage point to core inflation in April and many. So significant increases and they'll disappear over over the following months and they'll be transitory. They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods. So that's base effects. The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks. So this is what we're seeing in supply chains in various industries and we're in close touch with all of these industries. You know the the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter too. So what do we mean by a bottleneck? A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply change for for a particular good or goods. Something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market. We think of bottlenecks as things that in their nature will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they're temporary and expected to resolve themselves. We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months. It's much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks or for that matter the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime. So you know I'll just sum up and say we understand our job. We will do our job and we are focused as you've seen for many years. We've been focused on inflation deviating below 2% and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2% if if we see inflation moving materially above 2% in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2%. No one should doubt that we will do that. This is not what we expect but no one should doubt that in the event we will be prepared to use our tools. Thank you James Politi. Paul you said a few weeks ago that it would thank you Terpile. You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal. Can you define what your definition of a string of months is more specifically? And on inflation the FOMC said the rise in inflation we are beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors as you just described. But why use the word largely and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be transitory based on the initial data that you are seeing? So what is a string? What do I mean by a string? Well I would say what we have right now is one really good. I can tell you what it's not. It's not one really good employment reading which is what we got in March. We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading and I was just suggesting that we would want to see more like that. We are 8.5 million jobs below where we were in February of 2020 and that doesn't account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy that trend we were on. So we have we are a long way from our goals and we don't have to get all the way to our goals to tap our asset purchases. We just need to make substantial further progress. It's going to take some time. On largely, there are a bunch of factors. I was really thinking we were thinking of of the base effects and also the energy effects. I wasn't meaning to say there are some real effects. I mean there are always there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation. There's a basket for CPI or PCE. There are many many many factors that go into it. Relative prices are always moving up and down. This we would we think it's very fair to say that the increases we see and frankly are about to see later this week or largely due to base effects. It would have been more contentious to say entirely due to base effects because there are some things that are always going up and so we just said largely. Hi, Terri Powell.

We supervise banks to make sure that they have risk management systems in place so that they can spot these things. We don't manage their companies for them or try to manage individual risks. In the grand scheme of these large institutions, the archaegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions. What was troubling though was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be, to carry relatively well understood risks. The prime brokerage business is a well understood business and so what surprisingly their number of them would have had this. And it was essentially, I believe the fact that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms and some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things. I wouldn't say it's in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms. In some cases, it may be there were, it seems as though they were risk management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them. And that's what we're looking into. Thank you. Nancy Marshall-Ginzer. Hi Chair Powell. I'm wondering, are you planning to visit the homeless encampment that's near the Fed in Washington that you drive by? Have you been invited and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there? You know frankly, I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I've been very busy, but I will visit. I don't want to visit at a time of a lot of media attention because I don't want that to be part of the story. But I will go visit when it's no longer a news story. And I have met with homeless people many times, a number of times anyway let's say. And I think it's always good to talk to people and hear what's going on in their lives. What you find out is they're you. They're just us. I mean, these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and they have lives. And they've just found themselves in this place. It's a difficult problem though. There are many, many facets of it and I'm well aware that this is not something that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that. But I will do that when the need arises in when it's not so much in the public eye. And is there anything specifically that you would be looking to learn there? Not really. I mean, I think I know what I'll find there. I think you connect with these people and what you, again, what you find is they're like you. That could be you. I mean, that could be your sister. That could be your kid. You always feel that way in that sort of an encounter and it, you know, it's just it's an important thing to engage in. I think and I think it, you know, we bring that understanding into our lives and frankly into our work, the work that we do as well. Thank you, Hannah Lynn. Hi, I wanted to ask about digital currency. You've previously said a few times that you think it's important for the US to get central bank digital currency, right? Rather than be first, but with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of moving to slow on digital currency. Right. So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well. Central bank digital currencies are now possible and we're going to see some of them around the world. And we need to understand whether that's something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve. How would it work in our system? And there's some very, very difficult question to answer, but I think we and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues. I am, I would say this, we're the world's reserve currency. And that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world far more than any other currency. And that's because of our rule of law, our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world, our economy, our industrious people, all the things that make the United States, the United States. That's why we're the reserve currency.",-0.0002258982143283,0.0008848076141282362
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 19:05:00,2021-04-28 19:10:00," And of course we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you're going to be the reserve currency. So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency. I am less concerned that someone, another country might have a digital currency first. You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that if you were a company that's doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your international transactions? Or would you still do them in dollars, which is what everyone does? And I'm not so concerned about that. I am really concerned about getting it right. It is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate. In a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system, we have FedNow and other immediately available funds pretty soon. Everybody will be able to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just to use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time. It'll be normal. And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment? Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead. I mean, the currency that's being used in China is not one that would work here. It's one that really allows the government to see every payment that's used for which it is used in real time. It's much more to do with things that are happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with the global global competition. Thank you, Michael Derby. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations. A number of different surveys and market indicators are showing multi-year highs in inflation expectations ratings. So I wondered if that was something that you saw as consistent with your inflation outlook. Is that something that worries you or do you see that as maybe the success of the Fed's new inflation framework, making it out to the broader public? Right. Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit, and here we think of survey market-based survey being either households or economists and market-based. You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2% inflation target, particularly our 2% inflation target, which calls for 2% average inflation. So they were at the low end. Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they've just moved back up to levels broadly where they were in 2018, or in some cases, 2014. I would say more consistent with our mandate. We want them to be higher, and on a persistent basis. We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it had been running for the last quarter of a century. We want it to average 2%, not 1.7%. And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2%. We don't really see that yet, but I would say that break-even have moved up in a way. Break-even are based on CPI, of course, but there are now at levels that are pretty close to mandate-consistent, whereas before they were below. We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, as you would obviously know. So that's where I would say it is. One small follow-up. Do you have any red lines on inflation readings where if you hit like a certain number on, say, you know, CORE-PC, that would be a trigger response from the Fed? Doesn't work that way. Inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile. We expect, as I mentioned, we expect CORE and Headline-PCE to move up because of base effects. And we expect that to go away. We also expect these bottleneck effects to come in. We don't know how persistent they'll be. We think they'll, you know, it's a matter of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through, but we can't be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them. They don't seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we don't know. I mean, you know, this is all about the reopening of the economy. That's what's happening. We were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we're seeing a strong rebound in activity. And what's happening is it's, you demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and the saved up fiscal transfers and people going back.",0.0003347440403605,0.0009089386944769906

The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed. And you're seeing some of that, that'll happen over a period of time, overcoming quarters. You'll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time. Thank you. Thank you. Brian Chung. Brian Chung with, yeah, I chairman Powell Brian Chung with Yahoo Finance. I wanted to ask about financial stability, which is a part of the Fed's reaction function here. It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they're paying attention to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin. And it seems like there's interesting reach for yield in this market to some extent also archaic. So does the Fed see a relationship between low rates and easy policy to those things? And is there a financial stability concern from the Fed's perspective at this time? Right. So we look at financial stability for us is really we have a broad framework. So we don't just jump from one thing to another. I know many people just look at asset prices and they look at some of the things they're going on in the in the equity markets, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets. But really, really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability. So we can so we can talk about it the same way each time. And so we can be held accountable for it. So one of the areas is asset prices. And I would say some of the asset prices are high. You are seeing seeing things in a capital markets that are that are a bit frothy. That's a fact. I won't say it has nothing to do with with monetary policy, but it also it has tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy. That's really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast, a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening. So that's that's part of what's going on. The other the other things though, you know, leverage in the financial system is is is not a problem. That's that's a that was one of the four pillars asset prices was one leverage in the financial system is is not an issue. We have very well capitalized large banks. We have funding risks for for our largest financial institutions are also very low. We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they're not systemic right now. And and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape. It was it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis is sorry the pandemic crisis hit. There were real concerns of course with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all that that the that the household sector would would would weaken dramatically that hasn't happened. So with with the fiscal transfers money that's on household balance sheets they're in good shape. You see relatively low defaults in that kind of thing. So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but on balance it's you know it's manageable I would say and it's by the way I think it's appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity. Again eight and a half million people who had jobs in February don't have them now and you know there's there's a long way to go till we reach our goal. So that's what I would say. As a follow up you mentioned money market pressures the Fed didn't make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves. What was the logic behind that seems like so far has been drifting closer to zero so just hoping for clarification on that. Right so the federal funds rate has been well within target and target range and money market funds money market conditions are fine. We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case. We do expect further downward pressure on on rates through asset purchases and also that runoff in the in the treasury general account but at this point we didn't see a need for to deploy our tools to to support rates and of course we will do so if if the need does arise. Thank you. Team Young. Hi Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a similar question. We are seeing elevated market valuations and some economists are concerned that the economy might overheat at least for a period of time. So should the Fed and other regulators be thinking about tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the non-bank sector so that financial stability risk stays as low as it has been. Thank you. So I think capital requirements for banks are to me to the the the went up tremendously really over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic and the banks.",-0.0014341715269146,0.003140658339526749
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 19:15:00,2021-04-28 19:20:00," really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three of our stress tests and that is another one that's pending. So capital is in a good place as far as the market's heard in the banking system. But to your point, what we saw was so what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that requires attention. And number one is is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again and we need to we're looking at that. So we're looking at ways and people around the world are looking at ways to make those vehicles resilient so that they don't have to be you know supported by the government whenever there's a you know severely stressed market conditions. It's a private business they they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others around the world to come in. So that was that the other one is treasury market structure. Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago and the need for capital is higher because there's so much more supply of treasuries and so there are some questions about treasury market structure and there's a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there's something we can do about this because we you know the US Treasury market is probably the most single important single most important market in in the economy in the world. It needs to be liquid. It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens so it's not clear what what where that takes you but we we're taking a careful look in the treasury department is really going to be leading this at at treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient strong treasury market that can work even in difficult times as you know at the very beginning of the financial of the of this recent crisis there was such a demand for selling treasuries including by foreign central banks that really the dealers couldn't handle the volume and so what was happening was the market was was really starting to lose function and that's that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases and you know so we'd like to we'd like to see if there isn't something we can do to well is that do we need to build against that kind of an extreme tail risk and if so what would that look like? Thank you Edward Lawrence. Thank you Fed chairman for the for the question so I'm interested in your thoughts there's so much fiscal help and accommodation from the Fedors are you said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or lead to more normal economic conditions later this year when do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet so to speak and along those lines with the fiscal spending and the accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation does more spending need to be injected into the system or without effect that transitory nation nature of the inflation thank you. What will the economy be able to stand on its own feet? I'm not sure I'm not sure what the exact nature of that question is. Well what I'm saying is is you know when will the when you need to lower the the amount of treasuries you're buying it just sort of taper off a little bit when can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side and then and then for the transitory. Okay sorry so we have you know we've articulated our test for for that as you know and that is just we'll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress and we're going to communicate well in advance of any decision we're going to let you know the public know that that's what we're thinking and and so there'll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing but it's about substantial further progress toward our goals that's that's really all it is it doesn't have any any external virus related specific requirement although again I do think it'll you know the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals but it's really the economic goals now your second question sorry just just say again I didn't quite get that question yeah sure with with all the fiscal spending that's happened in the accommodation in it does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward upward pressures on inflation long term so it's really up to Congress we we're not an advisor to Congress",-7.181156644957085e-05,0.0010298414523159621
2021-04-28 18:30:00,2021-04-28 19:20:00,2021-04-28 19:25:00," You know, we don't weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals. That's really between elected parties. You know, basically fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and they get to be accountable to the voters. We didn't do any of that, and we don't have a seat at that table. We don't seek a seat at that table. So that's really something for Congress and the administration to deal with. Thank you, Greg Rob. Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I want to circle back to the housing market. It's just kind of confusing that the question and your answer, you know, the housing market is strong, prices are up, and yet the Fed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets. Why is that? And are those purchases playing a role in all in pushing up prices? Thank you. Yeah, I mean, we're, we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we've sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that. It's not meant to provide direct assistance to the housing market. That was never the intent. It was really just to keep that is, it's a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own. And so that's why we bought, as we did during the global financial crisis, we bought MBS too. Again, not in intention to send help to the housing market, which was really not, not a problem this time at all. So, and you know, it's a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time, and that time is not yet. Thank you. And for the last question, we'll go to Mike McKee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I am last, let me go back to Paul's question, the first question, and ask him to ask you whether, not whether you're thinking about thinking of tapering, but why you're not. For seeing Bank lending fall, the market seem to be operating well. Are you afraid of a taper tantrum, or is it as one money manager put it, if you get out of the markets, there aren't enough buyers for all of the Treasury debt. And so rates would have to go way up. Autumn line question is, what do we get for $120 billion a month that we couldn't get for less? So it's really not more complicated than this. We articulated the substantial further progress test at our December meeting, and really for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals. And remember, substantial further progress from December, from our December meeting. And then, vaccination started to get more widespread. The economy reopened. We got a really nice job report for March. It doesn't constitute substantial further progress. It's not close to substantial further progress. We're hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal. And we believe we will, just as a question of when. And so when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we'll do that. But that time is not now. We're just not, we're not that far. We've had one great jobs report. It's not enough. We're going to act on actual data, not on a forecast. And we're just going to need to see more data. It's no more complicated than that. Well, if we leave rates where they are, it doesn't change anything. But does it change anything if you fully tapered a bit? If you spent less, would you still get the same effect on the economy? If we bought less, you're very faint. So if someone has a vine, they turn it up. But if we bought less, you know, no, I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy. It's really part of overall accommodative financial conditions. We have tried to create a accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity. And we did that. And we articulated the tests for withdrawing that accommodation. And we think, you know, so we're waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled, both for asset purchases and for lift off of rates. And you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we'll go ahead. You know, we've done this before. We did it in the last, after the last crisis. And you know, we'll do it in, it may be, we'll do it as those tests are satisfied. We'll do it. And the only thing that will guide us is, are the",2.8486618470744275e-05,0.0006225904552093841

2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Wide spread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Each of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in activity from depressed levels. The sector's most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have shown improvement. Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions. The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March summary of economic projections. Even so, the recovery is incomplete and risks to the economic outlook remain. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven. It rose 419,000 per month on average in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8%, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should weigh in in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5% at the end of this year, and declining to 3.5% by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. The population has increased notably in recent months. The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6% in April, and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation, as well as the past through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending, as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation notably for this year. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from 3.4% this year to 2.1% next year and 2.2% in 2023. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum employment goal.",-0.0006998066635828,0.0023044759099115518
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:35:00,2021-06-16 18:40:00," Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2%. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we'd be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy. The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed and new strains of the virus remain a risk. Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time so that inflation averages 2% over time, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now. More important than any forecast is the fact that whenever lift-off comes, policy will remain highly accommodative. Reaching the conditions for lift-off will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near 0. In addition, we are continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least 80 billion per month, and of agency mortgage-back securities by at least 40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the committee had a discussion on the progress made toward our goals since the committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. While reaching the standard of substantial further progress is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue. Incoming meetings, the committee will continue to assess the economy's progress toward our goals. As we have said, we will provide advanced notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases. On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve's administered rates. The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by five basis points in order to keep the Federal Funds Rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets. This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the Federal Funds Rate or stance of monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Mr. Chair, first we'll go to Rachel Segel, the Washington Post. Thank you, Michelle and Helen. Thank you to your Powell for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023. And I'm curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with child care perhaps they've retired early, many barriers that you see keeping people from the labor market as you consider a full employment going into 2023. Thank you. Thank you. So I would say if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it's clear and I am confident that we are on a...",-0.000379830975216,0.002543500998383553

I mean, I think that's shown in our projections. It's shown in outside projections. And if you look through the current timeframe, you think one and two years out, we're going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market. In terms of exactly what that means, we'll have to see how things evolve. I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend. And I have no reason to think that that won't happen again. At the same time, we have seen, in terms of participation, we've seen a significant number of people retire. So we don't actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I would tend to look at it and think that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that. But overall, this is going to be a very strong labor market. In terms of the near term, you ask as well. So we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply. There are very large amounts of job openings in there, a very large number of people who are unemployed. And the pace of filling those jobs is somehow slower than it might be. So I'd point to a number of things. The first of which is just that most of the active sort of going back to one's old job, that's kind of already happened. So this is a question of people finding a new job. And that's just a process that takes longer. There may be something of a speed limit on it. You've got to find a job where your skills match what the employer wants. It's got to be in the right area. There's just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job. So that's sort of a natural thing. In addition, I would say that we look at, for example, a significant number of people still say that they're concerned about going back to work in jobs where there's a lot of public facing because of COVID. So that's clearly holding back some people. And that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead. There's also the question of childcare. Many are engaged in caretaking. And as schools reopen and childcare, daycare centers open in the fall, then we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers. Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into the fall by the end of September. And I'd like some of that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs. So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well. So you put all those together. I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into the fall. I will also say, though, the last thing I'll say is this is an extraordinarily unusual time. And we really don't have a template or any experience of a situation like this. And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data. It's not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy. We need to see more data. We need to be a little bit patient. And I do think, though, that we'll be seeing some things coming up and coming once that we'll inform our thinking. Thank you, Paul Kiernan. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for the question. Your, the committee's medium forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year. As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4% in the CPI. And I'm just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those kinds of rates before you get nervous. Thanks. So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you'll see that the incoming data are consistent with the view that prices, the prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. So the, for example, the experience with lumber prices is elustered as the thought is that prices like that have moved up really quickly because of the",-0.0024935879167854,0.0027617732488929695
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:45:00,2021-06-16 18:50:00," shortages and bottlenecks and the like. They should stop going up. And at some point, they in some case, you should actually go down. And we did see that in the case of lumber. Another example where we haven't seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It's going up at just an amazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop. And then in fact, it would reverse over time. So we think we'll be saying some of that. When will we be saying it? We're not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, though, although, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the timing of that is pretty uncertain. And so are the effects in the near term. But over time, it seems likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be temporary. And we'll be wanting, we're going to be looking. We'll be looking at the monthly pricing data. I'll also say that the labor market is going to be important both for the maximum employment goal, but also for inflation. And we'll be looking at that. And as I mentioned, what we expect, and I expect, that we'll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply, abate, wane, move down. So I can't give you an exact number or exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down. If you look at the forecast for 2021 and sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, you'll see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the full range of inflation projections for 2023, it falls between 2 and 2.3%, which is consistent with our goals. Thank you. Now we'll go to Elon Moui at CNBC. Hi, thank you, Chair Powell for doing this. My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you're making to more of your goals in order to consider to keep bringing your asset purchases. In that discussion, you said that you didn't have a major substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress in that discussion. Did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases? All right, so I expect it will be able to say more about timing as we see more data, basically. There's not a lot more light I can shed on that. But you can think of this meeting that we had as the talking about, talking about meeting, if you like. And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has served its purpose well, I think. So committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in December, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective. And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the committee will continue to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, and we'll give advance notice before announcing any decision. The timing, of course, the line will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar. Thank you. Now we'll go to Chris Regaber, AP. Right. Thank you. Well, you mentioned, let me ask about inflation expectations. You said they were, I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target. Does that mean that some of the shorter term measures we've seen out there, such as the New York Federal Reserve's three-year outlook, which jumped a bitch? Should those sort of be dismissed? And are we only looking at longer term inflation expectations? And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point? And on a related point, I think we should note, with the Fed, consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis. Thank you. So we do tend to look at the longer term inflation expectations, because that's really, we think, what matters for inflation. So the shorter term ones do tend to move around, based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you'll see, if gasoline prices were to spike, you'll see.",0.0008332738137752,0.0025956088965089657
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:50:00,2021-06-16 18:55:00," the shorter term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up. And that's maybe not a good signal for future inflation if gas happens to spike and then go back down again. So yes, I think if you look at the broad range of longer term inflation expectations, they have moved up, they moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins. So that was a concern. So it's good actually to see long term inflation expectations move back up to a range, it's a range that's consistent with what our objectives are. These are not precise measures and they contain risk premiums of various kinds and that's why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of indicators, which are from surveys of economists, surveys of the public and also market-based. It's a wide index, as I'm sure you know. We look at that and we see them back in the range where they were and by the way they've been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago. At a time when inflation was still anchored and at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below. So the answer is yes, I think they are anchored and they're at a good place right now. It's gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. And as you know, it's fundamental in our framework, our new framework to assure that our inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal. We think that's an important reason. If inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that's consistent with your goal, it's not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term. So it's important. Okay, now we'll go to James Politi with the FT. Paul. Hi, thanks, Trapal. Your economic projections today forecast us 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment for 1, a half percent and core inflation of 3 percent. If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress in your mind? And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in the past 3, showing not one, but two interest rate increases at the time. I mean, is this kind of, can you describe the sort of tone of the discussion in the committee? And are we really moving towards sort of a post pandemic stance? Is there greater confidence that the recovery will be a full recovery sooner than expected? Well, your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the committee will make, and it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not qualify. That is, you know, the process that we're beginning now at the next meeting, we will begin meeting by meeting to assess that progress and talk about what we think we're seeing, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases. In terms of the two hikes, so let me say a couple things, first of all, not for the first time about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They're not a committee forecast. They're not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriated any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be highly premature, it wouldn't make any sense. In our, if you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you'll see that sometimes people mention their rate path and their interventions often they don't. And the last thing to say is the dots are not a great forecaster of future rate moves, and that's not because it's just because it's so highly uncertain. There is no great forecaster of future dots. So dots to be taken with a big grain of salt. However, so let me talk about this meeting. The committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements, the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made. And it's outcome based. It's not time based. And as I mentioned, it's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment inflation.",0.0016176225705925,0.002403331350386653
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:55:00,2021-06-16 19:00:00," and on track to exceed 2 percent. And the projections that give some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case. And I honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants, many participants, are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the committee's forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals. So the other thing I'll say is, right increases are really not at all the focus of the committee. The focus of the committee is the current state of the economy, but in terms of our tools, it's about asset purchases. That's what we're thinking about. Lift off is well into the future. The conditions for lift off are very far from maximum employment. For example, it's a consideration for the future. So the near term thing is really the real term discussion discussion that will begin is really about the path of asset purchases. And as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to at future meetings continue to see you think about our progress. Thank you. We'll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. Continuing, Chair Powell continuing in that vein, when you're ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that? So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent. And I can just tell you, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is. And we'll try to be clear. And as I mentioned, we'll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so all I can say is that we think it's important. We think where the balance sheet's concerned, a lot of notice is much transparency as we can give, and as far as as far in advance as we can, to give people a chance to adjust their expectations. And we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on time. It wouldn't be appropriate to say we're going to have to see more data. We're a ways away from substantial further progress, we think. But we're making progress. So you can't say generally how far in advance you would signal. Again, as we approach that goal, it will provide as much clarity as we can. Great. Thank you. Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg. Craig Torres at Bloomberg. If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2% inflation. In other words, does the FOMC have a look back period? Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years? Is over the next three years you're going to be above inflation? So what is your look back period? Does the committee have one? And if not, why not? And if they don't, why isn't this just flexible inflation target targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2 and a quarter percent? Thanks. You know, we, so as part of our year and a half long process, the review that we did came out with at the end of that with the new statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, we look carefully at the idea we've all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded in a, you know, I strongly agree that it's not wise to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that. So we did adopt a discretionary. There's an element of discretion in it. You know, it says that we will seek to seek inflation that runs moderately above 2% for some time. And it's meant to create a broad sense that we won inflation to average 2% over time. But and that under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was 2% was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. They were always getting back to 2%. So you were bouncing back and forth between 1 and 1 and 1 and 2. And we wanted them to be centered around too. So that's the approach that we're taking. And you're right. It's not a formula like approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework. Was there another part of your question, Craig? Craig? That's pretty much answers at Chair Powell. Thank you.",0.0014275875172183,0.0026141926897666782
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 19:00:00,2021-06-16 19:05:00," Thank you. Now we'll go to Michael Derby. I'm particularly my question. So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage. And we've seen lately. I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility. And do you believe that the changes in the feds rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that. And then in a related question, do you think that fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets. So on the on the facility, we think it's doing its job. We think it's doing the reverse repo facility is is doing what it's supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its range. So we're not concerned with it. It's doing you have an unusual situation where the treasury general account is is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there's there's downward pressure. We're buying assets. There's downward pressure on short term rates. And that that facility is doing what we think it's supposed to do. Sorry. Your second question was again. Yeah, I mean change the rate control toolkit. Well, that have any impact on you think that will reduce the amount of money coming into reverse repose will that have any impact on money market conditions that you know beyond the fed funds rate setting. It could have some impact. I think we'll have to see empirically, but it's designed to keep the federal funds rate in in you know within the range and. I do think it could have some effect on on broader money market conditions below as it relates to you know the very low rates and the downward pressures. And will it will give me will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility or that's just not even really a focus of what the change was. It's not honestly and you know that the funny thing you would think that it would. But we'll have to see it's it's that they're it's possible that that that would not be the case. Well, that's going to be an empirical question. Thank you. I will go to Gina smell like the New York Times. Hey, Javier, thank you for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that as you mentioned it's pretty royal all the data is pretty been pretty royal by the pandemic and we're not really sure where E pop is going to settle in. And wages are already looking decent. So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and sort of how you're thinking about those wage data. Yeah, as you well know, there isn't one indicator we can look to and there's no one number that we can therefore point to we look at a range of indicators and it's a very broad range you can count to a high number just quickly. Certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that. So how do we think about it? A couple things. We're all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time. Now that was that hadn't happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle. So we're going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different it's a different economy. We we have had a slew of retirements and that may weigh on participation. That that effect though should wear off in a few years and and you know as as you move through that window because they would people would have retired anyway and you'll be back where you would have been. So I think we're I think the lesson number one is is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment and I think if you during the last cycle, there were there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, you know, as as 2012 when I arrived at the Fed and you know, you know, nine years later, eight years later, we were still creating jobs and and you know, it's quite remarkable. So we're all going to be informed by that at the same time we understand this is a different economy. You know the demographics are people are getting older and that should have a secular effect to of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what what can be done, but I think we're going to be we're going to lean into the optimistic. Yes, about wages, you know, we we're seeing wage increases that's that's sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy and.",0.0004743045509521,0.0012576825419424614

We don't see anything like that now. We do see high wages We see them for for people who are mostly new, you know entering into new jobs many of them in low-skilled jobs and But we do think so you've got to you've got to think in the labor market right now where where supply and demand are just not matched up Well, and you know, we think it's a flexible economy and and it will clear there will there will be a level at which Supply and demand meet and that'll that we think that'll that'll be happening in coming months So but the last thing I'll say is again If you look at the forecast we're going to be in a very strong labor market Pretty quickly here. We there are still a big group of unemployed people and you know, we're not going to forget about them We're gonna we're gonna do everything we can to get people back into work and given the chance to to work But there's every reason to think that we'll be in in a labor market with very attractive numbers with low unemployment high participation and rising wages across the spectrum so That's that's a little bit how We're looking at the at the labor market Thank you now. We'll go to handling at the American banker Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now As the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits and do you ultimately believe a permanent fixes needed and Any information on the timing around that would be would be helpful I can say as we're working on it um Don't have anything to to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now unfortunately, but um we we've always our position has been for a long time and it is now that we we like the leverage ratio to be a backstab To risk-based capital requirements When leverage requirements are are are binding It does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower risk assets for it for high risk ones It's a straightforward thing And because of the substantial increase in reserves, treasuries and other safe assets in the banking system The SLR is rapidly ceasing to become To ceasing to be the intended backstop that for a big firms that we want it to be so we do think it's appropriate to consider uh Ways to adapt it to this new high reserves environment and and we're looking hard at the issue We would also just to be really clear. We will take Whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements Sorry, I can't give you anymore. That's just something we're working on Thank you now we'll go to Anakin Tappa at CNN business I there thanks for taking my question Chairman Powell the price gems we've seen and some raw materials lumber for example you mentioned it earlier I seem to be easing and it looks like we're in the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand But I wonder if you worried at all if we're going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages And if we just continue this mismatch As we're recovering and you know we're getting out of the pandemic economy And I wonder how that would affect the feds outlook at all Um, well that is really not the problem we're having right now But but and and actually people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that because they know that You know, they don't want to build Build capacity and then find out that it's not necessary um, so really the problem now is is that uh Demand is very very strong incomes are high people have money on their in the bank accounts Demand for goods is extremely high and it hasn't Hasn't come down we're seeing the service sector Re-opening and so you're seeing Prices are moving back up off their lows there Um, but in terms of of over correcting. I mean, I think there there is a possibility on the other side of this that That inflation could be could actually be quite low Going forward, but that's not that's not really where our focus is right now. We're our focus right now is um We need to Our expectation is that these uh, these high inflation readings that we're seeing now Will start to abate and that's that's what we think and it'll be like the lumber experience and like we expect to use car",0.00123449122985,0.0014224076620359934

We expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there's no reason to think that they're going to keep going up a lot, because if they are, people will build new hotels. There's no reason for supply and demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time. So, we think that will happen. I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there's a lot of uncertainty. The overall story is one that we think is right, and we think the incoming data supported, and so do many, many forecasters. If you look at the forecast on the FOMC, you will see that as well. But, we don't in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that this goes on longer than expected, and the risk would be that over time. It does begin to affect inflation expectations. And if we see inflation expectations and inflation or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently, so we wouldn't hesitate to use our tools to address that. That's a price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that. We do not expect that, though. That is not our base case, and in that we're joined by many other forecasters. But there's a lot to be humble about among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It's highly uncertain business, and we're very much attuned to the risks and watching the data carefully. In the meantime, I would say we should, as I mentioned earlier, there's so much uncertainty around this. It's just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider at Voiders. Howard Schneider-Roters, thanks, Chair Powell for taking this. I want to miss the moment here, and I just noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy. So is this the effective end in your view of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it's still cited as a risk? You know, it's a continuum, right? What you've seen with the pandemic is sharply declining, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. And that's great. And that should continue. But you also saw in the United Kingdom, which, as I think at least as high, if not higher vaccination rates, they've had an outbreak of the Delta variety, and it's causing them to have to react to that. So you're not out of the woods at this point, and it would be premature to, in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory. Vaccination has a way to go to get to levels. It would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And that can only help. So look, you're right. The statement language is evolving. I would expect it to continue to evolve. There's a lot of judgment in that. But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that's what you do with statement language. It's great to see the progress, but again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. Who doesn't want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated. If I could follow up on that, if you view this statement in Toto and the dots and the steps as well, do you think this is more of a mark to mark an exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there? I think it's both. I think clearly, since March, what's happened is people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes that they'll be achieved. Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved. There's more grounds for confidence. We've seen growth come in higher than we expected. We've seen very strong labor demand. We've also seen, we have seen inflation above target, though. And I think, even though in our forecaster's case, they do see inflation coming back down over 22 and 23 into areas that are very consistent with our mandate. Nonetheless, the risk is something that can factor into people's thinking about appropriate monetary policy. The thing is, these are 18 different forecasts. And I can't stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people's minds.",0.0010180165250124,0.0013259145258671771

We'll go to Victoria Guita with Politico. I'm sure, Paul. I want to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you're thinking about this. So in the projections, inflation is expected to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a lift off in 2023. You know, I know that's obviously that, you know, take that with the great of salt, but that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2%. And so I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation? What would be because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn't caused by a trend. Is where factors in the in the next couple of years. So would that be the result of a tight labor market? Would that be because this full situation is raised people's inflation expectations? How are you thinking about that? So what we're seeing in the near term, again, our base cases that what we're seeing in the near term is principally associated with with the reopening of the economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints really. So, but you're right. When you get to in the forecast, all of that, the supply and demand sides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adapted, you know, flexible economy more so than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, you know, rising resource utilization or to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment or high employment is the way to think about it. So that's what that's about. That's that's about the kind of broad inflationary pressure. The results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. That's why, and that's why you would see it then because by then, you know, in the forecast, and it's just a forecast, they're just individual forecasts in people's forecasts. That's what's happening. So it's so it's so that the change of the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation. Yeah, I think there may be an element of the latter as well because inflation expectations have continued to move up. It's in, you know, it's all in people's individual thinking and it can't it's hard to say it's not something that committee debates. In terms of, you know, what what the outlook is for 2023. So I'm a little bit speculating which I shouldn't do, but I wouldn't surprise me if there's an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we've had. And thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2% that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought. And then inflation expectations may move up to a level they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2%. They might move up as a consequence of this or as a consequence of the new framework. You know, we did see inflation expectations moving up in the wake of the announcement of the framework, but you know, we don't really know that. So ultimately, I think it's consistent with both those things. Thank you. Now we'll go to Greg Robb at Market Watch. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I'm just looking at the forecast and the one thing I just don't think it's been talked about all that much is how much you got the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year. I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year as with higher inflation. And what do you think about that? We're looking at an economy that will not have the degree of fiscal support. The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year. So, but you've still got a very strong growth well above the longer run potential output of the economy. You've got you've got growth meaningfully above that and inflation is lower next year and all of our in all of our forecasts. I think the range of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you're right. You're seeing I can't remember the number, but it might be in the threes, 3 3 1 1 2% growth for next year. That's a really good year. Coming on the back of a 7% growth year, that's a really good year. That's a year with a lot of momentum. That'll see, you know, that'll cause significant job creation.",0.0008254103400974,0.000993471473176308
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 19:20:00,2021-06-16 19:25:00," I mean, we would take three and a half percent. We didn't have a three and a half percent growth year. We didn't have a three percent growth year between the global financial crisis and the end of the expansion. So that will be a good year. Doesn't it seem like there's a risk of, like, stagnation where that, you're gonna go from seven percent and down, that means the economy's really dissolling, dropping. And so we haven't seen that, right? Well, it's, the economy's not, not, dec... The economy is still growing and growing at a very healthy rate. Our estimate, I mean, different people have different estimates, but broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow it around 2 percent per year. If you're growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining. People should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up. Lots of things should be happening. Businesses should be investing. So, you know, I guess to answer your question in a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think? Yes, as I said earlier, you know, we don't have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening. And therefore, we don't think that, we think it's unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economies had for a quarter of a century. The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that we think have, you know, really held down inflation. All that's out there still. You know, when we get through this, we may well be facing those same forces. Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we thought? Yes, and if we see inflation moving above our goals in a time, sorry, to an extent, to a level or persistent, or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that. Thank you going to Brian Chung with Yahoo. I'm about Brian Chung Yahoo Finance. On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity. I noted that the medium projection for R-Star, the longer-term interest rate is still the same at 2.5%. But there's been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe change productivity in addition to combine with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or R-Star might be higher. What would the applications of that be for monetary policy? Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate and what might be the impact of that? A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount. And that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn, for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their policy rate was well below zero when the pandemic hit. So we don't want to be in a place where we can't react. A higher neutral rate would be, from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room in there for it than that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You can't estimate it with great precision. I think we would be alert to, I mean, studying our stories as a whole industry unto itself. And I think we would be alert to factors that might raise our star, the neutral rate of interest. And we'd try to keep up with that. And I think we're all thinking about that and the possibility of that. There are a lot of stories right now that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher our star. We don't know which of those stories will come true, but I mean, I'll give you an example. It's just there are a lot of startups, a lot of early stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don't know, but we'll be watching those things carefully. Great, thank you for the last question. We'll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. Mr. Chairman, of course, you'll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street. And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them. One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you're relying on...",0.0007089349434033,0.0012647455142905015
2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 19:25:00,2021-06-16 19:30:00," on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy. I wanted to get your view on how you square that. Another is that you have a long runway you've said for tapering with announcements. But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by a fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper? And finally, you've said the Fed knows how to combat inflation but raising rates also slows the economy. And there's a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly. So that's a few questions there. But so let me say first, I think people misinterpret the framework. I think there's nothing wrong with the framework and there's nothing in the framework that would, in any way, interfere with our ability to pursue our goals. That's for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework. We're certainly committed to it. We think it's well suited to our goals, including in this unique time. And I think if you look at the forecasts that we've written down, our committee is solidly behind them. The forecasts are all consistent with that. Your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve? And that's not the situation we're facing at all. The situation that we addressed in our statement and longer run goals and monetary policy strategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels. But inflation was low. And what we said was we wouldn't raise interest rates just because unemployment was low, employment was high. If there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling and balances. So that's what we said. That is not at all the current situation. The current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target. The question we face with this inflation is nothing to do with our framework. It's a very difficult version of a standard investment, sorry, a central banking question. And that is, how do you separate in inflation? How do you separate things that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of video-syncratic factors in a particular, due to a particular thing? Because I mean, a classic example was to pick a narrow example was the cell phone price war back in 2017, if you remember. There was a, prices were incredibly low. And it held down core PCE by three tens or something for a year. And then it fell out. So this is much bigger than that. And of course, it's not easy to tell in real time, which is which. But that's the question you would face under really any framework. And we're trying to sort that out. I've tried to explain that today about how we think about that. And we do think that these are temporary factors and that they'll wane. We can't be absolutely certain about the timing of that. And we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Your second one was, oh, you know, we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress. And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that. And that's what we're doing. That's what we're going to do. And we will follow through on that. There's no, I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction. But ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will taper as appropriate. The third thing was, what was the third thing? If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy. And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far. That's right. And we have to balance the two goals, maximum employment and price stability. Often they do pull in the same direction, of course. But when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there's no question that has an effect on activity. And that's one of the channels through which we get to inflation. We don't think that we're in a situation like that right now. We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole and an unusual hole, actually, because it's to do with shutting down the economy. It turns out it's a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to bring supply back up to snuff. That's happening all over the world. There's no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely. But we're going to watch carefully to make sure that evolving inflation and our understanding of what's happening.",-0.0012515940112406,0.0015842239667075548

2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in activity from depressed levels. The sector's most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement, but have not fully recovered. Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support. The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Nonetheless, the labor market has a ways to go. The unemployment rate in June was 5.9%, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should weigh in in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector, and on African Americans and Hispanics. African Americans has increased notably, and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply affects a bait, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal. Very low readings from early in the pandemic, as well as the past through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices, also contribute to the increase, although these base effects and energy effects are receding. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum employment goal. Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2%. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we'd be prepared to adjust the stance of policy. The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas. Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.",0.0001708194779756,0.0006835892995488569
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:35:00,2021-07-28 18:40:00," our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. As regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. In addition, we are continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic, and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition once economic conditions warrant a change. Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of substantial further progress. Incoming meetings, the committee will again assess the economy's progress toward our goals, and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset purchases will depend on the incoming data. As we've said, we will provide advanced notice before making any changes to our purchases. On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks, and another for foreign and international monetary authorities. These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Let's go to Steve Leesman with CMBC. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you might be able to put some, I don't know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of substantial further progress. What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or citing data if you could, that you cited in the statement today? And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like, if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets. Thank you. Great. Thank you. So, more detail on substantial further progress. So, let's talk about the maximum employment part of that. As you know, with maximum employment, unlike with price stability, where we can target a number 2 percent on average, with maximum employment, there isn't a single number that we can target. We monitor a broad range of data about different aspects of the labor market. There's unemployment among different age groups and such. There's participation. There's wages. There's all kinds of flow data. We look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what is maximum employment. So, there isn't, I can't give you a set of numbers. For example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was. We didn't do that here. What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals and what we said was we would keep effectively, we would give advance warning as we, and more and more clarity as we move forward. That's what we're going to try to do. So, what would substantial further progress be? I'd say we have some ground to cover on the labor market side. I think we're some way away from having had substantial further progress toward the maximum employment goal. I would want to see some strong job numbers. That's kind of...",0.0003302021064616,0.0021894813666013696

You didn't mean you feel like you've reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side. Thank you. So inflation is running well above our 2% objective and has been for a few months and has expected to run, certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it will move back to our target. The question whether we've met that objective formally is really one for the committee to make. I can't do that by myself, but it's clear that at this time inflation is actually running above 2%. And again, has been and will be at least we expect it will in coming months before returning down toward our target. Thank you and severe with orders. Hello, can you hear me? Hello, can you hear me? I'm sorry. Yes, yes, we can hear you. I apologize. I just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you know, is it is correct to see this as the start of the advanced notice process. You know, before a taper and and also can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into your thinking on on the taper. Thanks. As you know, we're in a process now where what we said is that at this meeting and in coming meetings, we're going to be continuing to assess the economy's progress toward our goals and give advanced notice. We'll be trying to provide additional clarity about our thinking both in the post meeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make. You know, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can. We have not reached substantial further progress yet. So we're not there and we see our ways is having some we see ourselves is having some ground to cover to get there. So that's what I would say in terms of in terms of of COVID and the delta strain. I'll say a couple things. Of course, it will have significant health consequences for many and we need to keep that in mind before we start before we mention and move to the economic questions. This is a rising cases in a number of parts of the country and some forecasts are for them to rise quite significantly. We'll see what we've seen though is with successive waves of of COVID over the past year and some months now. There is tended to be less economic less in the way of economic implications from each wave and we will see whether that is the case with the delta variety, but it's, you know, it's a, it's certainly a not an unreasonable expectation. So it certainly is possible that people would pull back from some activities because of the risk of infection, dining out, traveling schools might some schools might not reopen. We may just we may see economic effects from some of that or it might weigh on on the return to the labor market. Some people might choose again. We don't have a strong sense of how that might work out. So we'll just be monitoring it monitoring it carefully. Thank you. We'll go to Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. Hi, chair Powell. Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise and inflation above 2% this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2% for some time. And I noticed you didn't repeat that qualification last month or today. And so in your view, has the rise and inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2% for some time? That would again be a question for the committee, but I would really say the guidance that you're talking about is really the guidance to do with lift off. Right. That's what the guidance is for looked up. We had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment. Inflation at 2% and on track to run to run moderately above 2% for some time. It really isn't relevant now. It because we're really we're looking at a tapering asset purchases were clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It's not something that that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of lift off, which we are not at all at now or near now, that's when we'll ask that question. That is when that will become a real question for us. Thank you, Gina.",0.0008764541170578,0.0011364596333682366
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:45:00,2021-07-28 18:50:00," me all like it the New York Times. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about re-acting. You know, does that affect in effect how you're thinking about tapering? Does it affect how you're thinking about potential lift-off down the road? And if you could just talk a little bit about that. I'm sorry for the first 15 seconds of your question. You froze. Could you say that again? I apologize. Oh, yeah, no, sorry. Yeah, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergencing global growth and the sort of multi-speed recovery we're seeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies. So do you take into account that sort of multi-speed recovery when you're thinking about tapering QE and do you take into account when you're thinking about lift-off? Thanks. So it's an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is. And in many cases, it's related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to vaccines. And so they're seeing significant outbreaks in its wing on economic activity, whereas other countries such as the United States in particular are having a very strong rebound. And now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well. It's a feature of our economy. Now, how does it affect our policy? In a couple of ways, potentially, one just is that in general, economies and through financial markets and through trade are deeply interconnected now. And so a stronger global economy will lead to more US exports and that'll help economic activity. To the extent that global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it will wind up exporting some of our demand through imports rather than having a lot of exports. That's one way. Another way, though, is more on the risk side. And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there's time and space for the development of new strains, no one's really finally safe. These strains, there's no reason they just can't keep coming. And one more powerful than the next. We don't know that, but that's certainly a plausible outcome. Now, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity. But it is both the right thing to do and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason. Thank you, James at the FT. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, how would you describe the risk to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected? Do you believe the risk are tilted to the upside? And does the committee share that view? Or are they in balance? Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from the Delta variant? That could tilt them sort of to the downside again. You could give us a sense of that. That would be very helpful. Sure, I'd be glad to. So if you look again, if you look at the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected. But essentially, all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn't the kind of inflation that's spread broadly across the economy. It's new used and rental cars, it's airplane tickets, it's hotels, and it's a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it that is really about the reopening of the economy. So we look at that and we think that those are temporary things because the supply side will respond. The economy will adapt. We have a very adaptable flexible economy and labor market. And it's a real asset that we have. And so we think that inflation should move down over time. Now, we don't have much confidence, let's say, in the timing of that, or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say in the near term that the risks to inflation are probably to the upside. I have some confidence in the medium term that inflation will move back down. Again, it's hard to say when that will be. I will say, though, that inflation is half of our mandate. Price stability is half of our mandate. And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently, that were above significantly, materially above our goal. And particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2%. So we won't have an extended period of high inflation. We think that some of it will fall away naturally as the economy is.",0.0009780507221653,0.001046310617778265

In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2% over time. Thank you. Victoria at political. Hi, Mr. Chairman. So one market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the Fed might eventually over tighten. So my question is, do you think that markets have bought into the central banks new framework and how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns? Well, so in terms of what's been happening in bond markets, I don't think there's a real consensus on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting. We've seen the long-term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real yields which may have been connected to some speculate connected to sentiment around the spread of the delta variant at concerned about growth. There was also some decline in inflation and compensation which is significantly reversed. And there are also so-called technical factors which is where you put things that you can't quite explain. So I don't see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the credibility of our framework if that's really your question. We are committed to achieving 2% average inflation over time. What we said was that in particular when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won't be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We've got you know seven or eight million people, fewer people at work than where it work before the pandemic. So we're you know we're we're a ways away from full maximum employment. But we have high inflation so it's kind of the opposite case. And we have to we have to deal with that. Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad-based and likely to be persistent and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that could cause them to rise. So we're monitoring that very carefully and we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. But again, I think our I think our framework is pretty well understood and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it's time to think about raising interest rates and how we assess that set of issues. Thank you. We'll go to Richard Bloomberg. Thanks very much, Michelle. Chairman Powell, you you you just alluded to the fact that you're prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to if inflation looks like it's getting out of control. I want to just try to understand that in the context of the framework and the forward guidance. Does that mean you'd be prepared to raise interest rates even if we're not at maximum employment at that point? Should you see this danger-remincation and two? Does it also mean you'd be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets? Thank you. So there's a there's a part in our statement on longer-run goals and and monetary policy strategy which Rich, I'm sure I'm sure you're familiar with which which talks about that case in which the two goals are intentioned. Most of the time if you have high inflation you also have high employment that they tend to go together. This is a situation where they're temporarily in different directions. We're not at full employment but we are having high inflation. We feel like we're going to be making good progress over the next the course of the next year, a couple of years really toward maximum employment. This is a very strong labor market. If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it's we're clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum. That's that's the path that we're on and it shouldn't take that long in macroeconomic time to get there. So that's that's what I think is really the likely case and again it's not it's not timely for us to be thinking about raising interest rates right now. What we're doing is we're looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we how close we are to substantial further progress and then and then tapering after that. The question you ask about would we raise rates if we hadn't finished cutting hadn't finished the taper hypothetical question.",-0.0009770506703022,0.0017518713170887965
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:55:00,2021-07-28 19:00:00," circumstance at the time, we could always just, you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that. But it's just hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation. Ideally you wouldn't be still buying assets and raising rates because of course you're adding accommodation by buying and removing accommodation by raising rates. So that wouldn't be ideal. I'll say that. Thank you. We'll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for taking the question. Now, so you're talking about jobs. You just said they're going to path. They're a very strong job market. You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor market survey and 9.2 million job openings. So what's the disconnect is it a skills gap? Is it the extended unemployment benefits? Is it the fact that people just aren't willing to relocate? What is the disconnect there? It's a really unusual situation to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high. And we think there are a number of things that work there. Maybe the place to start is just to say that this is now not so much about people going back to their old jobs. It's about finding a new job. So that's a time intensive labor intensive process. And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There's research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that. So it's not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they're just going back to their old job. This is about job selection, things like that. There may also be some factors that are holding people back. And this is what surveys say. They're people who are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID. These could be jobs where there's a lot of interaction with the public and where perhaps there's a family member who's vulnerable or whatever reason. There's also caretakers who are where schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of older people. And there's also been very generous unemployment benefits which are now rolling off. There'll be fully rolled off in a couple of months. And all of those factors should wane. And we think we should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward. I mean, ultimately, it's unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that many unemployed people. That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market. Of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it's very hard to hire people. And that may be because people are shopping carefully for their next job. I mean, I think the bottom line on this is people want to work. If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire. Some people will retire. But generally speaking, Americans want to work and they'll find their way into the jobs that they want. It may take some time though. Thank you. Rachel, go at the Washington post. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I wanted to follow up on what you said about their tending to be less in the way of economic implications from each way of COVID cases. Could you elaborate on what you've seen to that end during previous waves? And then looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor market to the Delta variant? I'm thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back and travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering their travel plans or if caretakers were suddenly faced with a prospect of schools not reopening. How do you see some of those risks going forward? Thank you so much. Sure. So if you remember the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better than anyone expected. We were coming off the spring wave where there were a lot of shutdowns and then this big second wave hit. And I think the natural thing to do is to expect that it would have a real impact on the economy. It was much less than people thought. People who what's happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated. They're going on with their lives. Secondly, we've kind of learned to live with it. A lot of industries have kind of improvised their way around it, particularly for example, buying a new home. That process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process. And so they were able to do that. Other industries as well have gone to take out and no contact things. So that can all, it seems like we've learned to handle this. Now I think people would like to get back to",2.4336472889932777e-05,0.0006141388408698905
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 19:00:00,2021-07-28 19:05:00," the way things were, and I hope to some extent we will over time. Of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects particularly in hospitality and leisure and other entertainment, other areas with a lot of direct contact, a lot of jobs were lost in that because that was a very strong wave that happened in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived. So with Delta, we're just going to have to watch. And with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective, we're not experts on this, but it seems like a good going in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less. There probably won't be significant lockdowns and things like that. But again, those are not decisions for us or others. It's something where we be expert in. In terms of the channels, this is kind of speculation, but it's just that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the Delta wave to quiet. I'm not saying this will happen, but it's easy to imagine that. It's also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what, I'm just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn't be hard to imagine that happening. If schools don't open, then caretakers have to stay home. And if people don't go back into the labor force and the job growth won't be as strong, those kind of things. So I don't, it doesn't, it doesn't, again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future. It doesn't seem as though the effects will be very large, but there may be effects. And it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months. Or not. There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect. And we're just going to have to see what the economic effects are. Thank you. Now we'll go to David Gurra at MPR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to ask if you've started drafting your Jackson whole speech, but I'm going to go in a different direction here. Steve, please, I'm going to ask you about semantics. I'm going to take a cue from him and ask you about the term transitory. Because I think if you as somebody who's so lucidly explained policies and programs and made a real concerted effort to explain them to the American public as a whole, I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don't know it definitionally. Don't know what it means and see prices going up and wonder how long they're going to have to wait. So just some broader definition from you. I'd like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it. And quickly as well, you've talked about vaccines a bit and your colleague and Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that better reserve bank. And I wonder if that's something that you would like to see or expect to see system wide going forward. The concept of transitory is really this. It is that the increases will happen. We're not saying they will reverse. That's not what transitory means. It means that the increases in prices will happen. So there will be inflation, but that the process of inflation will stop. So that there won't be for. When we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That's inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it may be, I'm just taking an example and not making an estimate, then you have a price increase, but you don't have an inflation process. And so part of that just is that if it doesn't affect longer term inflation expectations, then it's very likely not to affect the process of inflation going forward. So what I mean by transitory is just something that doesn't leave a permanent mark on the inflation process. Again, we don't mean, I don't mean that producers are going to take those price increases back. That's not the idea. It's just that they won't go on indefinitely. So to the extent people are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs are something's going up, you know, the question really for inflation really is, does that mean they're going to go up the next year by the same amount? So you're going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process gets going. And that happens because people's expectations about future inflation move up. And we don't think that's happening. There's no evidence that it's happening. All the evidence is that it's not happening. But nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is, you know, we have two mandates, maximum employment and price stability. Price stability for us means inflation averaging 2% over time. And so we've got to be very careful about that. But I think it's a good point that it's a term. What it really means is temporary. But then you got to understand that it doesn't mean that the increases will be.",-0.0001785308164656,0.001208156020298965

In terms of, so we're working virtually here and we'll be coming back down the road in a couple of months starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington. And we're going to follow public health guidance and things like that. We really haven't made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like, and it will depend on, to some extent, on what CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in. Thank you. We'll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. Everyone, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your tapered timeline in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data, and the statement says that the Fed is going to use, to evaluate the developments in the two markets in jobs and inflation in coming meetings. Does that suggest that we wouldn't see anything before September or November in your meetings? And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you're going to lay out your tapered plans at Jackson Hole. Is that, is that the plan or are we not going to see anything until the fall? So any decisions about the timing, and I did not, if I said we're looking at one, a couple more months of data, I'm not meaning to suggest anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that decision. All I'm saying is we're not at substantial further progress. There's a range of views on what timing will be appropriate, and those views ultimately track back to people's views about the economy and what will happen as we make progress towards our goals. So that's really what it is. And we will, of course, as we, you know, we're going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on timing, pace, and composition. But today I've given you what I can give you, because again, this was the first really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition, and it was a good meeting, but no decisions are made, and I'm just not in a position to give you much guidance, really, any guidance on the actual timing. But I will say we're making progress, we expect further progress, and we expect that if things go well, then we will reach that goal. And when we reach it, and the committee is comfortable, that we have reached it, then we'll taper at that point. I really, there's nothing I can say about Jackson Hole. You know, we're in the process of writing that speech, and I am going to give a speech, but I wouldn't want to say what will be in there at this point. Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that the Fed has got the markets working well, and you've got bank loans up, in other words, you've stimulated demand, but savers and companies like insurance companies and pension funds are getting hammered by the low rates, and they're wondering if the balance hasn't started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good. We, asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis. They really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which are very, very important to our economy and the global economy. And then they were a big part of creating a combative financial conditions to support demand. They were strongly needed. It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now. So we said we would taper when we achieved substantial further progress, and we're going to honor that commitment. Again, we're talking about it right now, and meeting by meeting and moving in that direction, we will taper when we reach that goal, and we'll provide more clarity on that as we go as is appropriate. Thank you. We'll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. Hi, you've been asked a lot previously if the Fed's monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed's regulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed's bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower income households seeking loans. Basically, is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access? Thanks. Well, I say…",-0.0002615895546153,0.0008194109345837248
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 19:10:00,2021-07-28 19:15:00," I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks. And I think that an under-capitalized banking system, as we've seen, can be a real threat to the economy and mostly to the greatest extent to people at the lower end of the income spectrum. So if you look back at not this crisis, but the previous one, the banking system was under-capitalized. So higher capital requirements are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform. I think it's other tools that we have to, and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools, other agencies have some of these tools, to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly the low- and moderate income communities. So that's CRA. We enforce CRA. We're working on a new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it's going to be good. And we'll support the flow of credit to low- and moderate income households. It's also the anti-lending discrimination statutes that we enforce. And it's some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate income communities. I don't think it's capital standards at all. I think capital standards work the other way. And capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate income communities. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Ruggabour at the AP. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last, when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of, it won't take too long before we see if you're right about inflation and its temporary aspect. You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy. Can you tell us a little more what you mean by that? When do you think you'll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we're seeing now? Great. So with inflation, as I mentioned, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation. And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that widely across the whole range of goods and services that are in the economy, we're seeing upward pressure on prices. That's not really what we're seeing. What we're seeing is a handful of things that are really account for the overshoot of inflation. When we mentioned, it's things like cars, new used and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage, because of the semiconductor shortage. And housing, sorry, hotels and air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before. So that's a big, big part of why the inflation readings are so high. Those frankly don't carry significant implications in the long run for inflation or for the American economy. So what I said was we're going to see whether these things, we don't need to see everything do what lumber prices have done. So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. So what we want to see is these other things, do the prices flatten out? Do they actually move down? If they flatten out, then their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time. So they're not contributing to inflation. So if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the things that have really moved up quickly, then they won't all happen at once or happen quickly, but we'll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct. And I don't think it will take what I said was, I don't think it'll take a very long time to see whether that's the case. It is probably the case that frankly the overall reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time. This is a world historical event that the global economy is now reopening. It's not going to happen quickly. It's going to take some time and it's going to be very uneven as we discussed before. But I think we will know when we know, but I don't think it will take that long. I don't want to put a number on it, but I do think that if we see those things happening, we'll know that we have the story, basically, right. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Chung at Yahoo Finance. Sure. Hi, Jim. I'm Brian Chung at Yahoo Finance. I just want to give you to provide a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking",0.0004780433397139,0.0005688411567953764

Within the context of home prices continuing to rise, we've heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they'd like to cool off on specifically the MBS purchases. Is that more because of the optics or is it because there was an observed relationship from the committee's view between MBS purchases under QE and housing market? Thanks. So a number of participants raised that the questions around MBS and tapering at today's meeting as a matter of fact, in yesterday's meeting. And I'll just say that generally speaking, I don't think that Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways. There may be modest differences in terms of contribution to housing prices, but it's not something that's big. It's not, so where I think we are is, there really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries. I think we will taper them at the same time. It seems likely based on where people are now. The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people. Others not so much. And I think it's something that we'll be continuing to discuss. Thank you. Let's go to Michael Derby. Thank you very much. Yeah, so I wanted to ask you about the standing repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions. And also kind of an assembly related point. The reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting. And are you concerned to see nearly a trillion dollars a day pouring in through that facility? So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do? So it really is a backstop. So it's set at 25 basis points out of the money. And it's there to help address pressures in money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy. So really it's to support the functioning of monetary policy and its effectiveness. That's the purpose of it. And it's set up with that purpose in mind. Your question on the RRP. So we think it's doing what it's supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal fund's rate stays within the target range. It's essentially what's happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of federal reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves in a higher amount of federal reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances. So that's all that's really happening there. And we expect it to be high for some time. It's being driven, of course, by the relatively lower quantity of treasury bills and also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that. So we don't have a problem with what it's doing. It's kind of doing the job we expect it. And you don't see any issues with like disaggregating markets from investing in private money market securities. Like the idea that the Fed's footprint in money markets is getting too big. You don't see any issues there. Not really, not at this point. I mean, money markets, private money market funds are choosing to invest because the rates are attractive. At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as the whole rate cluster normalizes and you'll see a shrink back down. Okay, thank you. Thanks, let's go to Greg Rob at MarketWatch. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, I'm going to go back to inflation a little bit. I'm kind of surprised by your tone. It seems like you're just sort of warning that if inflation gets too high, you know, the federal act, isn't it true that I mean, a little inflation is good for the economy and that we, it's somehow maybe we can get the economy out of this sort of place where we're always going to be close to the zero lower bound. Isn't there a good story to tell in your sort of panicking people? I certainly don't don't have that in mind. No, look, we, as you know, we were targeting a moderate overshoot of 2% inflation for some time. We want inflation expectations to be centered on 2%.",-0.0003413535886473,0.0008190939910355024
2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 19:20:00,2021-07-28 19:24:42," we feel like they may be a little bit below that. So the bigger picture is that that would be a healthy thing. This is a different thing. This is not that. That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from a very, very strong labor market and a booming economy. That was the kind of inflation. This is something different. This is really driven by the supply side, which is not able to handle this big spike in demand. They were seeing as the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side, just all over the world, you're seeing the same thing, which is it just can't keep up. And their labor shortage is in a lot of places, the same sort of thing. So there's absolutely no sense of panic. I just I've explained, I think several times here today, that my best estimate is that this is something that will pass. It's really a shock to the economy that will pass through. And if you look at where forecasters are, people who actually write down a forecast for a living very, very strongly, they see it that way. Now, we're actually responsible for this, though. So we have to take seriously the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent that it might actually move inflation expectations up and that we might, that the kind of things it might require a response. Again, we don't see that now, but we have to be on the alert for it. And people have to understand and believe that we will react if we need to, and we will. But again, it's not my base case. My base case is that, as I've said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down. And no, we're not, we have not at all changed our view. And I haven't changed my view that inflation running above 2% moderately above 2% is a desirable thing. This is not moderately above 2%. This is well above 2%. But it's also not the kind of inflation we were looking for. This is really driven by a supply side shock. Thank you. Thank you. We'll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the last question. Hi, Chair Powell. One if you could talk about wages, many workers seem to have gotten some good wage gains in recent months. Working workers generally expect going forward. And it doesn't sound like you're concerned about rising wages, feeding into broader inflation. Is that right? So wages have moved up. A lot of that is driven by new hires. And a lot of it is driven at relatively low paid jobs in the service industries as people come back. So that's not troubling. And we don't see, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation. And we're not seeing that right now. And that really is what we call unit labor costs move up. And which really puts it move up in a way that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it happens gradually, we've seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and put some pressure on margins. In a long expansion, that's been happening late in the expansion. That's not a problem either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices, it was called the wage price spiral. We don't see that now. This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the great inflation. But it's not a feature now. We don't see that now. Of course, we'll be watching it. And this is one of the reasons why we're watching, so carefully, to see whether labor force, whether people do come back in and accept jobs, given the very large number of job openings, and the very large number of unemployed people, we'd like to see some matching going on there, so people get back to work. We think labor supply would be a healthy thing. But wages moving up across the spectrum consistent with inflation and productivity is a good thing. Thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you all for coming.

2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4% pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half. The sector's most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year, but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June summary of economic projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the past three months. In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project a labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year, and 3.5 percent in 2023 and 24. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector, and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants' inflation projections for this year. While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal. The median inflation projection from FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next year. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints, could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation. Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum employment goal. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer run inflation goal of 2 percent. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.",-0.0004323487916988,0.0018341098871054258
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:35:00,2021-09-22 18:40:00," The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus and risks to the economic outlook remain. The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic, and since then have helped foster a combative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals. If progress continues broadly as expected, the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the committee's guidance. While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate left off, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test. We continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-4% target range for the federal funds rate, until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favourable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year. As a result, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022. Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer run level through 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. More important than any forecast is the fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum employment and price stability goals. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you. We'll go first to Rachel Segal. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. When it comes to the taper and eventually to any rate increases, I'm wondering if you can walk us through what substantial further progress looks like given the latest batch of productions that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, you know, employment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June. If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what substantial further progress looks like, that would be great. Sure, so, so the the test for beginning our tapers that we've achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of inflation and maximum employment. And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress substantial further progress. So that that part of the test is is achieved in my view and in the view of many others. So the question is really on the maximum employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that since last December, when we articulated the test and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate, unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate, 50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that's that could be substantial for their progress. Many on the committee feel that the substantial for their progress test for employment has been met. Others feel that that it's close, they want to see a little",-0.0015935892182306,0.0024860303341316726
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:40:00,2021-09-22 18:45:00," more progress. There's a range of perspectives. I guess my own view would be that the test, the substantial for their progress test for employment is all but met. And so once we've met those two tests, once the committee decides that they've met and that could come as soon as the next meeting, that's the purpose of that language is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting. The committee will consider that test and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider. Thanks Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. So looking at the steps, we are now basically four years of inflation above target and policy never gets to the long run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives. One, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year. And second, from the perspective of the average household that's now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running, which for some this year, our real wages have actually gone down. Sure. So as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the out years. And that's really, I think, a reflection of, and they've moved up significantly for this year. And that's, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottle next insured is that that are being that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation is going to be higher this year and a number, I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tents. Why, there's a very modest overshoot. You're looking at 2.2 and 2.1, two years and two years and three years out. These are very, very, I don't think that the households are going to notice a couple of tents of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to, we want to foster a strong labor market and we want to foster inflation averaging 2% over time. And I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. In terms of the framework, I see this is very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2%. We want, we're, that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework. And you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2%. I wouldn't put too much on a couple of tents over 2% in 2023 and 24, one 10th and 24, but you're right, those are the numbers. Thank you. Let's go to Colby Smith. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline. And I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been for those that want to move a bit more quickly. Is it about maintaining optionality for 2022 interest rate increase or is it about financial stability risks or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? Thank you. So let me say that there's very broad support on the committee for this plan both us to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today and I'd say quite, quite broad support for this approach. You're correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner and they've made their arguments publicly for some of them. It's a financial stability concern and for others, it's other concerns they can make their own, make their own arguments. This is an approach that the committee will broadly support and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the in the early stages of the crisis. They were essential in restoring market function in the treasury and other markets. Then as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand as they will do. And now we're in a situation where they still have a use but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their use is usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework, the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go in. Again, broad support in the committee.",-0.0006384676775738,0.0021699406121516414
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:45:00,2021-09-22 18:50:00," Thank you. We'll go to Nick Timrose. Hi, Nick Timrose, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you have said the test for a lift off is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate lift off and not just a taper may be closer at hand. Does the committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for lift off that you've articulated, or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? Well, so again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months and everyone's figuring. So you're going to be well away from satisfying the lift off test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the lift off test, though, you know, it is what we adopted last September. It's it's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment. And while we while we have interesting signs that in many ways the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market. And we think that that those imbalances will sort themselves out. Inflation at 2% and on track to to achieve moderately higher inflation over 2%. You know, that really depends on the path of inflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of of 2000 and 22, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach lift off. So I just think if you look at if you look at what people are writing down for year and 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low on employment rates. And that's only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they're writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test. There's a range of perspectives about where the economy will be. But by the way, all but one participants have a lifting off during 2023. So it's not it's not really an unusually wide array of views about this. Thank you. We'll go to Gina. Sneha like. Hey, chair, pal. Thank you for taking our questions. Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that presidents, Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year? And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate. So. No, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that's why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics, ethics rules are on permissible financial holdings in activity by federal officials. So those rules are in many respects the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. One of those is sort of three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictions. One is ownership of certain assets is not allowed and that's bank securities and other things. Secondly, there are times when we're not allowed to trade at all, where to buy and sell financial assets and that's the period immediately before during an FOMC meeting. And third, there's regular disclosure. So all of these everyone's ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis. So I would have had to go back and read people's financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time. And I guess you'd say it served us well. The other thing you would say that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of of really sustaining the public's trust in us. We need to make changes and we're going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thorough going and comprehensive review. We're going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards. Great. Thank you. We'll go to Steve Leasman. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on Jean's question. The issue of ownership of these stocks and trades. Do you think it's appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you're looking at? And in that these you said yourself, they don't clearly not seen as appropriate in that the Fed's code of conduct says federal.",-0.0020991626166517,0.002624645503613602
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:50:00,2021-09-22 18:55:00," that officials should avoid even the appearance of conflict, do those trades in fact, and holdings violate the Fed's code of conduct, find that you have a timeline as to when you might get done with your review. Thank you, sir. Don't have a timeline yet. We can start with that. So let me address the Muni question since that's in there. I personally own municipal securities for many, many years. And in 2019, I froze that meaning. I, they're no, I'm holding all the securities, my wife and I, to maturity. And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because as you, as you know, the law was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities. So it was not an uncommon thing. And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis. And I reversed that policy. And I did it without hesitating. And the reason was that, that the financial markets, and including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse. And it was time to go. And we did. But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and who looked carefully at it and said that I didn't have a conflict. So that's, that's one answer that I wanted to share with you. Secondly, as you're right though, as a, we're going to be looking at all of those things. I really, I don't want to get ahead of the, the process here and speculate about particular outcomes. But this again, comprehensive and deliberate process, we're going to make changes. I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well. And what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public's interest and the institution that we're all a part of. I'm sorry, Chair Powell, I just want to follow up. You said I was right. When you said it right about that the Fed should not own, the Fed was official not on the same assets they're buying. I think that's a reasonable thing. And of course, for the most part, we don't. I mean, it was a real coincidence. I happened to pre-own these munis. They were, they were bought many years ago actually. And so we started buying munis as part of the municipal liquidity facility. So it's really not a, it just was an unforeseen event and I couldn't sell them. So, so what I did was I just held them check with the ethics people and went ahead. So, but it's a general principle. Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Regaber. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, Chair Powell. Why did question about jobs and the Fed's schedule in the Fed's policy framework of you laid out here? You and other Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September. As more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating. You mentioned in the past, the extra unemployment benefits expiring. There's some real time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply. So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports? And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans? Thank you. So you're right. We have a really, I'll call it a unique situation where by many measures, the labor market is tight. And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying, it's quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that cuts are quite a tight labor market. So our view, I think widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall including kids back to school, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the exploration of unemployment, extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply. And so we get out of this strange world where there are lots of unemployed people in a high unemployment rate, but a labor shortage. And so what happened was delta happened. And you have this very sharp spike in delta cases. And I think so that affects, for example, when schools are open 60% of the time or when they're always at a threat of being closed because of delta variant, you might want to wait, rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you're going to wait until you're confident of that. So some of that may not have happened. Also, people didn't, as you know, hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months. So really the big shortfall in labor in jobs was largely in travel and leisure. And that's because of the clearly.",0.0010975191494225,0.0034127347686668625
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 18:55:00,2021-09-22 19:00:00," because of Delta. So that all happened. And so what we know is that didn't happen. I think there's still, it may just be that it's going to take more time, but it still seems that that inexorably people will, these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020. They'll get back to work when it's time to do that. It just may take longer time. You're right, though. It didn't happen with any, any force in September. And a lot of that was Delta. In terms of the, you asked also about the test for November, I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think, and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting or not, depending on whether we, whether we feel like that those tests are met. Well, this quickly, if I just quickly follow up, I mean, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September? And I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead? Or are we at a point where you've accumulated enough progress? So it is, it's accumulated progress. So, you know, for me, it wouldn't take a knockout, great, super strong employment report. It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met. And others on the committee, many, many on the committee, feel that the test is already met. Others want to see more, more progress. And, you know, we'll work it out as, as we go. But I, I would say that in my own thinking, the test is all but met. So I don't, I don't personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I'd like to see a good decent employment report. I mean, it's, it's not, it's, again, it's not to be confused with, with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher. Great. Thank you. Hey, thank you. Well, good. Victoria Guita. Hi, Chair Powell. So I wanted to ask about the vice chair of supervision position. And just, I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you deferred to that person on regulatory policy. And then just sort of a related question. As you know, Randy Corals is vice chairmanship ends next month. And I was wondering if he's going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he's replaced in that role. Sure. So Dodd-Frank created this position, vice chair for supervision. It's, it's, there's actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank, Frank Languages. I'm sure you know. And effective probably what it means is that the vice chair for supervision is charged with, with setting the regulatory agenda. And you know, it's a, it's a specific grant of authority. And in the 10 years, almost that I've been at the Fed, that person has really done that. Dan Tarula certainly did it. And, and, and, right, Chair Corals did it as well. And I would, you know, I, I think I respect that authority. I respect that. That's the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward. And I would accept that. And, and, and furthermore, I, you know, it's fully appropriate to, to look at, for, for a new person to come in and, and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and, and, and, suggests appropriate changes. And, and I welcome that. In terms of vice chair Corals term, we're, we're, we're not currently in that situation. And I actually don't have any updates for you on that today. We'll keep you posted on that. Thank you. We'll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg. Thank you. Uh, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework. In particular, uh, Bloomberg surveyed economists. And we found that they predict lift off will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8%. But the black unemployment rate is 6.1%. Now, I'm wondering if, if a 6.1% unemployment rate for African Americans is consistent with full employment, or whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy. Right. So the, the, the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group. Really, we look at a broad range of, of, of, a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is. And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing. So we will do all of that. So I think if you, if you look back, what were we really, what were we really thinking? So we all saw the",-0.0005024666544855,0.0017842845705136215
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 19:00:00,2021-09-22 19:05:00," benefits of a strong labor market. If you look at the last two or three years of before the pandemic hit, you saw, after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market. And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else, something that's great to see. We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minority and minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates. We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics. And by the way, we also, there was no reason why it couldn't continue. There were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic. We were not, there was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession. So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this. It would have been great. So we're all quite eager to get back to that. We also said we wouldn't raise rates just in response to very low unemployment in the absence of inflation. So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way. That's, of course, not the current situation. We have significant slack in the economy, and inflation well above target, not moderately above target. So that's really how we think about it. It isn't really just targeting the headline numbers, but it's about taking all of those things into account and you're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment. I guess just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about, or should the gap be narrowed if not down to zero? Well, you really, I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn't be any gap, of course. We would all love to see no such gap. This is a persistent gap, and it's very hard to explain based on typical metrics. It's quite troubling. But it really is, we have famously broad and blunt tools, I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination, racial disparities, and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies, frankly, education policies and that kind of thing are better at focusing on. I think we've identified the part that we can do, and we'll do that part, but I would always been clear that it's going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems. Thanks. Thank you. Let's go to Michael McKee. The plan for dealing with a debt default, that included prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations, and possibly selling non-defaulted treasuries and buying those that are. Are all of those still on the table? Do you think any of those would work? And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised? So I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question. So it's just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come to. That's a critically important thing. The failure to do that is something that could result in severe damage to the economy into the financial markets. And it's just not something that we could contemplate. That we should contemplate. I'm not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that. I'm just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn't default on any of its obligations should pay them when and as do. And that no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure, fully protect in the event of a failure to make sure that we do pay those. That's when they're doing. If I could follow up, have you discussed options with members of Congress? I don't generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected officials or other appointed officials. But you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it and including elected people. Thank you. Let's go to Hannah Lang. Hi, thanks so much.

I was just curious under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding companies license and if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo in your opinion warrant such an action. So we're, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems. They represent a serious matter to us and the firm is required to remediate them and we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation. We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems and we're not going to remove that asset cap until that until that's done. So bottom line is we'll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging and unsafe and unsound practices are violating laws but I can't speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank. Thank you. Now we'll go to Michael Derby. Thank you for taking my question. You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren't aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed bank presidents. As you know, those all 12 regional Fed bank presidents just went through the re-nomination process earlier this year and Governor Brain or described it as a rigorous process at the time. So I want to note did anybody know, did anybody at the board level know about the stock trading activity and going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston Fed bank presidents to do their job? So these, I don't need to tell you, people file these reports annually and I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020. So I don't have any reason to think people at the board would have known about particular trading that's going on. They will see that they're people at the Fed who see the trading reports when they're annually filed. You know, in terms of having confidence in that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. That's something we take very, very seriously. This is an important moment for the Fed and I'm determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time. I'm very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate though about about different things and you know, when we have things to announce, we'll go ahead and do that, but that's really what I have for today. So what one small follow up, I mean, I know that you didn't have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past year forms in hand, in the case of like the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past. So that in theory could have been something that came up in the re-nomination process. So that's, yeah, that's a good question. So, you know, the five year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the reserve bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things. And if there were a concern, a public concern or a private concern about something that someone had done, we wouldn't wait for the five year, we wouldn't wait that day if we, if there were concerns. You're right though, these, these, as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time and it's similar to what other government agencies have, only it's a little stricter. And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt. You can't trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting, that blackout period and during the meeting. And then you disclose all this and we have disclosed it for years. So all of these things have been going, to the extent they've been going, they've been a matter of public record. And, you know, but nonetheless, so that, you know, it was seeming to work just okay. And now you, now you look at it and you see this and you think we need, we need to do better and we will. But you're right, but it has not been part of the process and appropriately, I don't think it should have been. I mean, I wouldn't blame the people who conduct that review. I really think if someone had raised concerns or if we'd had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn't have been part of that process, it would have been raised instantly rather than once every five years.

2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 19:10:00,2021-09-22 19:15:00," Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate. If inflation stays elevated, but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal, would you hold off on raising rates? How would you think about that? Thank you. Well, let me say one thing. You're looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off. And those conditions can change over time. So you're not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point, really, we actually have a paragraph in our framework and something like this has been there for a long time. It's I think it's paragraph six. And you're talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complimentary. They're somehow intention. And if we judge that's effect, that is the case. What it says is we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judge consistent with mandate. So we used to call that the balanced approach paragraph because it had those words. So it's a very difficult situation for for any central bank to be pardon me to be in a situation where the two goals are intention. And in that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two. How long will it take and how big are the gaps and that kind of thing? We don't really think we're in that. Well, we're sort of in that situation. I'd say in a short term way. But we think we do expect that that this is sort of a because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that you're seeing this temporarily. Great. Thank you. We'll go to Edward Lawrence. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for taking the question. So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we've been watching? Is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that's out there in the past? You said you're watching the level of corporate debt. So is what's your level of concern right now? And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue a sort of a warning signal? About the United States? No. Corporate defaults are are very low in the United States right now. Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic. We were very concerned in the last year. So we were concerned in the last year or so. And then I'd say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that if you've got a little highly leveraged company in your revenue stops for an uncertain period as it things happen at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults. Didn't happen potentially. I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES act and the response that we undertook and all that, it was a much stronger response than we've ever had. And I think for whatever reason now you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt. You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had. And the government has been working to get that under control. This is part of that effort. The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies and Evergrande is dealing with those strictures and it's something they're managing. In terms of the implications for us, there isn't, there's not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed, but you know that you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn't draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Chung. I'm sorry. I'm focused on doing my job. Focus on doing my job every day for the American people and I don't have any comment on that, Brian. Sorry about that. Let's go to Greg Robb. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, Chair. I was wondering if in your discussion about the tapering that you said that officials think it's appropriate to end around the middle of the year. If there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then I've heard some federal officials say that they wouldn't.",0.0021238210509488,0.0027876793711727158
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 19:15:00,2021-09-22 19:20:00," the balance sheet. Was that discussed? And what's your stance on shrinking the balance sheet? Thanks. So my thinking on this has been let's get through the taper decision and then let's turn to those issues. There are a number of related issues that you mentioned one Greg, but you know, and which you need to start to think about and we'll do that. But I want to get we want to get through this taper decision and then turn to those issues rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are you know focused on on those issues. Because we're really not and you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time. We've watched other countries and what they've done. So I think we'll be able to to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it's time, but it's it's just not time yet in my thinking. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Scott Horsley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You talked a little bit about inflation expectations and there does seem to be something I would divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists, which are pretty much in line with the FOMC members and lay people's expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey. How much weight do you put on lay people's expectations and what do you think accounts for that divide? So within let's just take the household surveys generally. The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically and this is from the New York Fed. It's only an eight-year-old survey and it does it does seem as though the they're looking three years out and it seems like there's a high correlation between three year and one year. For the most part surveys are showing that that households expect higher inflation than near-term but not in the longer term and that's also what expectations are showing. So there are many, many different inflation measures of course and that's why we have this thing called the CIE which is the index of its market-based measures, its professional forecasters and its household surveys and you just put them all, it doesn't have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in and you measure the change. Also you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing. So you can look at all of that and it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up. Many of the many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in say 2013 which was before the really drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in 14 and 15 around then. So that's not a troubling thing but you know inflation expectations are terribly important. We spend a lot of time watching them and if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate then you know we would certainly react to that. But we don't really see that now. We see more of a moderate increase that is that is in the first part of which is welcome and because you know inflation expectations had drifted down and it was good to see them get back up a bit but again we watch carefully. Thank you. Let's go to Heather Scott. Hi, sorry. You caught me off guard. Thank you, Chair Pearl, for taking my question. I really appreciate it. Again on the taper timing you say it's going to last a little bit of middle of next year but with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to inflation would you think you might need to have lift off happen before you finish the tapering? That's not my expectation of course we can always say we haven't decided to taper yet and we haven't decided to pace yet. So you know it's not my expectation that we would have to. We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if it becomes appropriate though. Absolutely. In fact back in 13 when we tapered we always said we weren't on a preset course. I think this will be a shorter period. The economy is much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013 so it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen. It's a very gradual taper. It will be when we agree on it but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate. But you wouldn't expect rate lift off to happen until you're finished with that process.",0.0012533898498211,0.001665678854746086
2021-09-22 18:30:00,2021-09-22 19:20:00,2021-09-22 19:24:18," It wouldn't know you because you know when you're as long as you're buying assets You're you're adding accommodation and it wouldn't make any sense to you know then lift off I mean what you would do is you'd speed up the taper I think if if that were the situation you're in not we don't expect to be in that situation But I do think it would be Wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper just because the two are then working in the same direction Right. Thank you. Thank you Okay for the last question. We'll go to Jeff Cox Thank you Mr. Chairman for taking the question. I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an updated all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency I believe that the report is supposed to come this summer and Vacations that's going to come this month, but drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the Fed's heading on this and just wondering if you can Provide some update there Sure, I'd be glad to so We think it's really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public's benefit That's one of our jobs We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trust worthy currency and payment system So there's extensive private innovation a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter and Innovation is fantastic. It our economy runs on innovation But where the public's money is concerned we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place and today They really are not in some cases So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency like products We're working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and if so in what form? We have two broad work streams one of which is really technology Both at the board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's work with MIT the other of which is Is to identify scope out deal with analyze the various public policy issues as you mentioned We do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement Engagement with many different groups including elected officials around these issues We think it's our obligation to do the work both on technology and public policy to form a basis for making an informed decision the ultimate test will apply When assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is are there clear intangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks We're also as you know investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S It'll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system since the 1970s We found the case for this quite compelling For consumers businesses and and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to the payment system So bottom line we haven't made a decision about the CBDC But we will be in issuing a discussion paper soon in order to in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we'll have Thank you very much Can I get a quick follow on that? Thank you I'm just wondering if you're okay Are you concerned that all was kind of falling behind in the global race for digital currencies? I think it's important that we Get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously I don't think we're behind I think it's it's more important to do this right than to do it fast We are the world's reserve currency And I think we're I think we're in in a good place to To make that analysis and make that decision by the way, which we which will be a government-wide decision We would we would do this we would have to have Meeting of the minds with with the administration and also probably with Congress We would we would really like to have broad support for this. It's it's a very important innovation And I think we would need that to go ahead and and that's the process we're engaged in thanks very much",-0.0001138018936635,0.0013891419202040755
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero, and in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases. With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery. Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments. Economic activity expanded at a 6.5% pace in the first half of the year, reflecting progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support. In the third quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace. The summer's surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sector's most adversely affected by the pandemic, including travel and leisure. The recovery has also been restrained by supply constraints in bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry. As a result, both households spending and business investment flattened out last quarter. Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. With COVID case counts receding further and progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong growth for the year as a whole. Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve and demand for workers remains very strong. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases. In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July. The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education. The unemployment rate was 4.8% in September. This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued. Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements. But participation for prime-aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels. In part, reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings. These impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus, supporting gains in employment and economic activity. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics. The supply and demand of balance is related to the pandemic, and the reopening of the economy, have contributed to sizeable price increases in some sectors. In particular, bottlenecks and supply-changed disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound and demand in the near term. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2% longer run goal. Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, specifically the effects on supply and demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself. We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation. Our tools cannot ease supply constraints. Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances, and that as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2% longer run goal. Of course, it is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation.",8.002370431885275e-05,0.0011254436845294386
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:35:00,2021-11-03 18:40:00," Global supply chains are complex. They will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain. We are committed to our longer run goal of 2% inflation and to having longer term inflation expectations well anchored at this goal. If we were to see signs that the path of inflation, or longer term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability. We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic, and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. Last September, the committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least 120 billion dollars per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. At today's meeting, the committee judged that the economy has met this test and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by 10 billion dollars for treasury securities and five billion dollars for agency mortgage-backed securities. We also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-December, since that month's purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to our December FOMC meeting. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year. That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. Our decision today to begin our tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy. We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the Federal Funds Rate. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery and employment and achieve our price stability goal. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. We'll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. Hi, Nick Timmerow, so the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year. Are they wrong? So, I would say it this way. We try to focus on what we can control. And that is how to communicate as clearly as possible in this highly uncertain world, how we're thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve. In that case and also in the cases which are frequent where the economy evolves in unexpected ways. So, the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases not on raising rates. It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured from last December. We don't think it's time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation. Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year and elevated inflation as well. And that as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate and job growth will move back up. And as that happens, inflation will decline from today's elevated levels. Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain, but certainly we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter. The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy. We think we can be patient if a response is called for, we will not hesitate. So, what I will tell you is we watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations and policy will adapt appropriately. And that's what I would say.",0.0002378892733564,0.0009519482486315695
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:40:00,2021-11-03 18:45:00," Well, based on your current outlook for the labor market, do you think it's possible or likely even that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year? So if you look at the progress that we've made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be yes. I do think that that is possible. Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility. Thank you. Thank you. Next we'll go to Gina at the New York Times. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you're thinking about wages at this moment. Obviously, we were seeing strong wage growth particularly for people in sort of lower income fields. I wonder if you see that as a positive thing or as a potential start to wage price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two things. So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly. And in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday. Now, in real terms, they had been running a little bit below inflation. So real wages were not really increasing. I think with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase. So, wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It's very important. And it's generally a good thing. You know, the concern is somewhat unusual case where if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on downward pressure on margins and cause companies to their employers really to raise prices as a result. And you can see yourself find yourself in what we used to call a wage price spiral. We don't have evidence of that yet. Productivity has been very high. The ECI reading is just one reading. Again, if you look back, we, so we'll be watching this carefully. But I would say that at this point, we don't see, we don't see troubling increases in wages and we don't expect those to emerge, but we'll be watching carefully. Next, we'll have Steve Lisbon from CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. You talked about the shortfall on employment or employment. That was before the pandemic. And yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody. Are we at or close to a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you've for recovering these lost jobs so that now from a risk management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate. So kind of a related question. The statement today says you'll keep policy accommodated. So you hit that 2% inflation target are surveys show looking for 5% inflation this year, 3.5% next year. It sure seems like you're on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2% target. Thanks. Yeah, so I'm not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say effect that could you just quickly succinctly say your first question again. Sure, the idea that the tradeoff between inflation and employment that you that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks are finally 5 million jobs again at the same time. So all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation. Is that tradeoff worth it or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate. Yeah, so you know, this isn't this isn't the traditional Phillips curve situation where there's a direct trade over where that's really what we're talking about. So the thing that we're seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It's due to bottlenecks and it's due to shortages and it's due to very strong demand meeting those. So I think it's not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff. So in this situation, we do have a provision in our statement on longer run goals, as you know, that says when when those two things are intention, what we do is we take into account the employment and shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judge consistent with the mandate. So we used to call that the.",0.0007999481114738,0.0014166297189449303
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:45:00,2021-11-03 18:50:00," balanced approach paragraph, we have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take. And we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are intention. It's very difficult. But what it really boils down to is something that's common sense, and that is risk management. We have to be aware of the risks that were particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year. We see well in next year, we see higher inflation persisting. And we have to be in position to address that risk. Should it become really a threat to create a threat of more persistent longer term relation. And that's what we think our policy is doing now. It's putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes. Thank you. I'm going to call B Smith at the financial times. Thank you. Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering? And I'm wondering how you would also characterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually. Thank you. So I guess as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month. And we're prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. So I'm not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be. Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we'll communicate very transparently and openly about that. But I'm just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement. So was there a second part? Yeah, it's just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have to do so later on. You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here. We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it's warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And again, if we feel like something like that's happening, then we'll be very transparent. We wouldn't want to surprise markets. We'll say in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this and then we would either do it or not do it. But I'm not going to start making up examples of what that might be today. Thanks. Thank you. That's what a Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post. Hi, Drew Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. You mentioned at the beginning that the Fed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means. What does your message to those families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now? And do you feel that your expectations around transitory inflation is that message is reaching them? Thank you. Yeah, so first of all, it is our job too and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term. We're accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we're also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control. We don't think it's a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further. And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the delta variant declines, so which it's doing now. So transitory is a word that people have had different understandings of. For some, it carries a sense of short-lived. And there's a real time component measured in months, let's say. Really for us, what transitory has meant is that if something is transitory, you will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation. So that's why we took a step back from transitory. We said expected to be transitory. First of all, to show uncertainty around that. We've always said that, by the way, in other contexts we just hadn't done in the statement. But also to acknowledge, really, that means different things to different people. And then we added some language to really explain more what we're talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three. We said that supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases. Then we said progress on vaccinations.",0.0018340101961461,0.0019442644199611885

So we're trying to explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about transitory. So it's become a word that's attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible. Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is look, we understand completely that it's particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes, we understand completely what they're going through. And we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn't become a permanent feature of life, really. That's one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment. And that's our commitment. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Rougay-Burrow, the Associated Press. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Well, I wonder if you could update us. You talked about getting back to full employment. And so could you update how you define that? I mean, you've, you know, a few months ago, yourself and other federal officials talked about getting back to the pre-COVID labor market. There was even a hint you might try to do something better than that. Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring. And there's talk of not being able to get back as all the jobs back because of that and other trends. You did mention the prime age folks. So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at, specifically to measure full employment? Will you be looking at prime age employment population ratio, for example? And if so, do you need to see that get back to pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment? Or is there something short of that that would work? Thank you. So thanks. So maximum employment is, it's a broad, we say, broad-based and inclusive goal that's not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors. You can't specify a specific goal. So it's taking into account quite a broad range of things. And of course, employment levels of employment, participation, or part of that. But in addition, there are other measures of what's going on in the labor market. Like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is. The level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states. So we look at so many different things. And you make an overall judgment. Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that's the goal. Because we didn't know any, that's what we knew. That we knew that was achievable in a context of low inflation. I think we're learning that. We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very COVID affected, by the way. A lot of what we're seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta. We were on a path to a very different place. Delta put us on a different path. And we see these things. But so I think we're going to have to, ideally, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn't another COVID spike. And then we would be able to see, I think, a lot. We would see whether how does participation react in that world, in that sort of post-COVID world? Right now, people are staying out of the labor market to do because of caretaking, because of fear of COVID, insignificant to a significant extent. We thought that the schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply. That doesn't seem to have been the case, interestingly. So I think there's room for a whole lot of humility here as we try to think about what maximum employment would be. We're going to have to see some time post-COVID so that we know or post-Delta anyway, to see what is possible. And I think the learning for those of us who live through the last cycle is that over time, you can get to places that didn't look possible. Now, what we also have now, though, is we have high inflation. So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation. And we have to balance that with what's going on in the employment market. So it's a complicated situation, and I would say we will. We hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year. Thanks, we'll go to Howard Schneider at Roeders. Thanks, and thanks for doing this. So given that answer about employment, I would like to get back to Steve's question a little bit. On a headline basis, just as it's evolved this...",0.0005067276177333,0.0013375328989947027
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 18:55:00,2021-11-03 19:00:00," do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met? Sorry, the two tests. The two tests in the state of the guy said it has to hit 2% of the contracts moderately, but above it for 2%. Has the economy cleared that? That's a decision for the committee. I would put it to you this way. When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a statement, a state where labor market conditions are maximum, or at maximum employment in the committee's judgment, it's very possible that the inflation test will already be met. We're aware that that language sounds a little out of touch with what's going on, but we're not at maximum employment. When that is the case, we'll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there's a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation is evolved in the last year and a half. So to follow up, you're not willing to commit that the current levels of the inflation and their persistence have met moderately at first some time. So given that, I mean, how we should rent, how should we render what moderately and first moderately over at first some time? What I'm really saying is that question is not before us right now. We're, we're, you know, we were, we had the question on when to taper. We've now answered that question and the speed of it and all that. We're not, we have not focused on whether we meet the lift off test because we don't meet the lift off test now because we're not at maximum employment. What I'm saying is when given where inflation is and where it's projected to be, let's say we do meet the maximum employment test, then the committee's, the question for the committee at that time will be, has the inflation test been met and, you know, I don't, I don't want to get ahead of the committee on that, but the answer may very well be, yes, it's been met. But we're not asking that question today because we're not, we're not running the lift off test. We're not evaluating the lift off test today. We didn't have that discussion at today's meeting. We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn't ask ourselves whether the lift off test is met because, you know, it's clearly not met on the maximum employment side. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Matthew Bozler at Bloomberg. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Bozler with Bloomberg. So when you're looking at this question of assessing whether or not the US economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing? And if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we're seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market. Thank you. So we don't actually define maximum employment as we don't, we define it in terms of inflation, but of course there is a connection there. Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices. But that's not really how we think about it. We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things. You can't just look at unlike inflation where you can have a number, but with maximum employment you could be in a situation hypothetically where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in. And so you wouldn't really be at maximum employment because there's this group that isn't counted as unemployed. So we look at a range of things. And you know, so the thing is by many measures we are at a very tight labor market. I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things like many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is how persistent is that because you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own, they're holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID or for whatever reason. They're staying out and it's clear that there are, you know, with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we're set up to go back to a higher job creation. So that would suggest that you're not at maximum employment. So at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing, but of course at the end of the day, it also has to be a level of employment that's consistent with price stability. And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be intention and how you would have to balance those two things. Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed's process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that say, come next year, you decide there's a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls? Yeah, I mean, again, it's a risk management thing. It's not, I can't reduce it to an equation, but ultimately, it's about risk management. So you want to be in a position to L ...",-0.0001293103448275,0.0008731741497332605
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 19:00:00,2021-11-03 19:05:00," act to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case. And in this case, the risk is skewed for now. It appears to be skewed toward a higher inflation. So we need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so. And we think we will be. So that's how we're thinking about it. And I think, though, that judgmentally, too, it's appropriate to be patient. It's appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further. We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived. And Delta stopped. It stopped job creation. It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there's excess demand for goods because their services are not available, people are not traveling. That transition itself could help bring inflation down because presumably people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that. So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is. And we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation. Butelnex should be abating. We start to see that now with some of them. But overall, they haven't gotten better overall. And we're very aware of that. So that's really how we're thinking about it. We're thinking that time will tell us more. In the meantime, we don't think it's time to raise rates now. If we do conclude that it's necessary to do so, then we'll be patient, but we won't hesitate. Thank you. Let's go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call. So the Federal Reserve, I want to talk about climate change. The Federal Reserve released a statement today. Says the Federal Reserve supports the efforts to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges, most relevant to central banks and supervisory outcomes. Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, like coal plants or fossil fuels? So that's not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That's a decision for elected representatives. So we feel that any role that we have, and we do think we have a role in climate change, it relates to our existing mandates. And our existing mandates are really prudential regulation of financial institutions. We expect them and the public will expect us to expect them to understand and be in a position to manage their risks. So that's physical risk and it's transition risk for climate. And by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already. And we think that's right within our mandate. There's also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system. And so from that standpoint, we can do research. We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change affects the economy, both physical risk and transition risk. But that's what we can do. And that's what we will do. And we'll do it well within the frame of our existing mandates. We'll do it well. We're not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change. That has to be elected people and not so much us. But we feel like we have that narrow mandate and we will do it well. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Victoria Guida, Politico. Hi, Chair Powell. So the FED recently announced that there's going to be new conflict of interest rules for investments by federal officials. And this follows obviously the resignation of two regional FED presidents. And I'm just wondering, do you think that there's more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the FED, such as requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts? And also, if you could speak to whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by federal officials, thank you. So we, let me just say that the system, the ethics system we had in place, had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well. And then that was no longer the case. And so we had no moment of denial about that as a group. We stepped in and we took the actions that we took. And within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to try to put us back where we need to be, which is we need to have the complete trust of the American people that were working in their interest all the time. Absolutely critical to our work as it is for any government agency. And I feel like this call that into question. So we reacted, I would characterize it strongly and forcefully.",0.0002155544059319,0.0009704131803674386
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 19:05:00,2021-11-03 19:10:00," or other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them. So you ask about blind trust. The overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE. And they have a long-held position, which is not favorable to blind trust. They do not encourage them. They don't think they're effective. They think they're cumbersome and they think they're better ways to get at the things that need to be done. And those are the things that we're actually doing. So I don't know that there are any blind trusts for that reason because they are the regular or they say this on their website if you look. In terms of laws broken, I ask the Inspector General to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there were laws broken. And I won't speculate on that. But that is with the Inspector General now and of course out of my hands. Thank you. We'll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg. Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that given the long and variable legs with which monetary policy works that you are likely to end up given inflation by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and therefore send the economy into recession. Given the fact that basically your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year and now you're talking about it not coming down to the second or third quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that? Well, so let me say what's happened and we're very, very straightforward about it is that inflation is coming higher than expected and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent. We see that just like everybody else does and we see that they're now on track to persist well until next year. That was not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters. Now let me say, it's difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times. When you're talking about global supply chains in turmoil, it's a whole different thing and you're talking about a pandemic that's holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample but we don't have a lot of experience with this. It's very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy. We have to set policy though. That's what we're doing. To look at your question this way, I don't think that we're behind the curve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes and that's what we need to do. I do think it would be premature to raise rates today. That's not, I don't think that's controversial, certainly. I don't know anyone arguing for that today. The reason is that there's still ground to cover to get to maximum employment and we don't want to stop that when there's good reason to think. There's still good reason to think although it's been delayed clearly, there's good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past significant outbreaks of COVID. That's when we're really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are. I think the bottlenecks that we're seeing in global supply chains around goods and frankly now at our own domestic ports because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports. Those things are going to work themselves out. We have a flexible economy. It will take some time but it took experts managed to create a vaccine faster than certainly than I expected and I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year. That is my baseline understanding and that's very widely held among people. But we are prepared for different eventualities and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment and we're going to let the data lead us to where we need to go. Our policy will adapt and has already adapted to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply side story which is also partly a demand story. So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate. Thank you. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. So you announced that the Fed is going to keep it a rate of starting at $15 billion a month and that's more than twice the pace of the last paper. So why are you tapering faster this time? The economy is in a quite a different place than when we tapered back in. I guess it was 2013. We were much farther away from maximum employment.",0.0005818714710573,0.0008837349657283809
2021-11-03 18:30:00,2021-11-03 19:10:00,2021-11-03 19:15:00," inflation was much lower. This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people. So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013 where we still had quite a ways to go. I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, little on price stability. So this is quite a different situation and the committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we'd articulated and this was appropriate and this is faster than what people had expected six months ago. It's earlier and faster and that's because our as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it's clarifying itself and that's partly because we see inflation becoming in higher. So. Thank you. Let's go to Mike Derby. I, yeah, thank you for taking my question. I wonder if the Fed has given any thoughts yet to the end game for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady or will you allow to start passively winding down? And then in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what Fed bond buying actually does for the economy in terms of its economic impact? Have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any any fashion? You know, because I'm sure you know, there's often been questions about what is bond buying actually doing to help the economy? Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mentioned, we haven't gone back to them now that we've tapered. I expect that that's exactly what we'll do in coming meetings and we'll do it in an orderly fashion and we'll talk about reinvestment and all those things. And we don't have to make decisions on those yet, but, you know, typically when we're doing a new subject like that, we'll have a series of briefings and discussions and that's what we will now begin to do. In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so there's a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this and, you know, you can kind of, you can find different people coming out with different views, but I would say most mainstream view would be that you're at the effect of lower bound. So how do you affect longer term rates? There are two ways. One, so you can't lower rates. Let's say you can't lower rates any further hypothetically. So you can, you can give forward guidance. You can say we're going to keep the rate rates low for a period of time either a specific period until certain conditions are met. The markets will do the math and that'll have an effect on longer term borrowing because even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing. So that's one thing. The other thing you can do is you just go by those securities, by longer term securities, that will drive down longer term rates and hold them lower. And, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers. So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People that you can service your debt, you have more free cash flow, you know, it's, it's not different from what we do with the short end. So that, that's, that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was, I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were a pin to the lower bound many, many years ago. So anyway, that's, that's how it's supposed to work. And, you know, the, it's, it's quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy and you can't run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. But most people thought, most of the findings are that, that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, which is to say at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do it. We do more, more, more accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity over time with a leg. So I think that's, that's the main finding I would, I would, I would say on, on QE. Thank you. We're going to go to Paul LeMonica at CNN. Yeah, Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you've addressed already questions about the, the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional Fed presidents and, you know, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the Fed. I was wondering also in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term. What would you say to the president and to senators that potentially, you know, will be voting on a re-nomination about this specifically with regards to your future as a, as Fed chair for a possible second term? So I'm not going to, I won't have any, I will answer your question, Paul, but I, I'm not going to have any comment whatsoever on.",-2.153919055719927e-05,0.0006894917153260934

I will say, though, that I have briefed administration officials and I've briefed people in Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction. But I, you know, this is part of my job, is Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously. So if you're on hour, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I'm in regular contact with you probably and, you know, when something like this comes up, I'm on the phone, I'm offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have. That's just part of my job. So I do that. I don't talk about particular conversations, but you can assume I'll always do that, and I certainly did it in this case. Thank you. Let's go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. Hi, I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio is the Fed still planning on seeking comment on ways to permanently adjust that, and how concerned are you ultimately about banks' willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix? So I don't have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now. We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel. We're also, we also have a, there's a working group, it's by Treasury, about over Treasury markets and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic and what structural things may need to be done. So that would be part of that work stream. And I know that there's a lot going on. I'm not sure when that report will be out. But so it's work underway. That's one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasury is greater central clearing and many other ideas. It's important that we have a liquid Treasury market. It's a huge public benefit that we do. And I think we need to do those things that enable that. While also assuring safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions who tend to be the main dealers. So we have to make sure that that's always a first-order concern as well. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chung at Yahoo Finance. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Chung at Yahoo Finance. So just to expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill and in the administration. You talked about what you've done already. But I'm just wondering if you could take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that, either from the public's view or from the financial community's view of the Federal Reserve's independence. And then secondly, do you look back on the whole episode and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened? Hi. You know, it's, I think it's too soon to say what the reputational damage is. I think from the very beginning, my reaction was we need to deal with this straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully. And that's what we're going to do. I mean, it means everything to me that we take, do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this happens again. I like to think we've made a real good start on that. If you think about it, you cannot execute a trade unless it's pre-cleared. And then you have to say, execute, it's not even a trade. Really, there's no trading going on. This is for investment and getting liquidity for life's expenses. But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or purchase. So I think it's a pretty good system. We'll always be looking to make it better. So in terms of our independence, look, I think we will address this. And I think we have. And I like to think it's enough. But it's going to, you know, we're just beginning to implement it. We have to write the rules, which we're doing, you know, as quickly as possible. We need more people. We're going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the board. And also, we're going to need appropriate technology. Because, you know, we have, the Fed has more than system, has more than 30,000 employees. Not all of them far fewer of them will be covered by this. But the senior officers who will be covered by this will have to have technology access and it's going to have to work efficiently. So there's a lot of work to do to implement it. You know, again, I would just say, this system has been a place for decades. And I, it was in place when I took over, it was in place for the last, at least the last three or four chairs. And, you know, it was what it was. And, you know, it proved to have, you know, it proved to have,",-0.000333864644811,0.000624919191483904

I'm a big believer in the value of the Federal Reserve System and the Reserve Banks, but you had 12 different ethics officers at 12 different banks and you had ethics people here. And you know, compliance wasn't all exactly the same. It was a little bit different and uneven. And also the rules were, you know, we didn't imagine the problems that happened. And they may have actually been, I don't know this, but they may actually have been in clients with the specifics of our rules. They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said, don't do anything that would create a bad appearance. I mean, that's clear. This was a bad appearance. So, anyway, what can we do? We are where we are. It happened. And we just have to deal with it forthrightly in transparency and own it and step up to this, you know, meet this moment. That's, I'm totally committed to doing that. And again, if they're better ideas, I'd love to hear them. But I think we have, I think we have so far made a good start. Can you speak with administration officials that that include the president? I'm not going to, I'm not going to answer who I spoke to at all. I just, I'm not going to, I'm not going to give you any names. So, don't take that as a yes or no. I'm just not going to start down that road. Okay. Thank you. We're going to go to Jeff Cox for the last question. Yeah. Thank you. Sure. I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment. We've seen what's been called the, the great resignation with folks leaving their jobs and the record numbers. Is there any feeling there that maybe you've been accused of fighting the last war that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment? And that full employment may not look like what it looked like before? Yeah. So, what's happening is people are leaving their jobs. They're quitting their jobs in all time high numbers. But in many cases going back into employment and getting higher wages. So, a lot of the higher wages you're seeing are for jobs, which are rather than incumbents. So, that's just, that's a sign of a really strong labor market as opposed to people just running off and quitting. There've also been, there are significant number of retirements and we'll just have to see what that means. So, toward, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economist estimate was the trend. And part of that was people staying in the labor force, or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire. So, maybe this was just catch up on that. I am a believer that over time you won't know how far, you won't know what can happen with labor force participation in advance. And you're just going to have to give it some time because we saw that over and over again. We're, there are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where, this is where the limit is. Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me. And so, I do think we need to be humble about what the limits are of labor force participation. But we expect labor force participation to participation to pick up. We don't know the pace at which it will do so. So, in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do is to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. It was so much to like about that labor market, really historically good labor market, never perfect, but a good labor market. We're in a different world now. It's, this is a, it's just very different. The pandemic recession was the deepest and the recovery has been the fastest. And wages didn't really go down and, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy. All of this is completely unusual. You know, the, an economy where inflation was driven by, by services is now inflation where all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter century. So, you ask about full employment. I think we have to, I'm very open to the thought that, that it's going to be an empirical question of where it is located. And we're just going to learn more and more. I mean, one thing we'll learn, I think, I hope we'll learn in the next, in the near term is once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what's going to happen to employment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again? If you look back to three,",0.0002557583331537,0.000711314206884625

2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the committee's forward guidance for interest rates. In addition, in light of the strength thing labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases. As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy. Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Aggregate demand remains very strong, void by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose risks to the outlook. Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply constraints, FOMC participants continued to foresee rapid growth. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5% this year and 4% next year. A mid-improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate has declined substantially, falling six tenths of a percentage point since our last meeting and reaching 4.2% in November. The recent improvements in labor market conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November but remains subdued in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. At the same time, employers are having difficulties, filling job openings and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. How long the labor shortage will, George's will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of the year. Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next. Supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2% longer run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year. While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, but thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation. We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put to upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to levels closer to our 2% longer run goal by the end of next year. The median inflation projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year. This trajectory is notably higher than projected in September. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are committed to our press stability goal. We will use",0.0003786690324465,0.0009089630246827089
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 18:35:00,2021-12-15 18:40:00," our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched. We will be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the committee reaffirmed the 0-24% target range for the federal funds rate. We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate. With inflation having exceeded 2% for some time, the committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessments of maximum employment. All FOMC participants forecast that this remaining test will be met next year. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 0.9% at the end of 2022, about a half percentage point higher than projected in September. Participants expect a gradual pace of policy firming with the level of the federal funds rate generally near estimates of its longer run level by the end of 2024. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. At today's meeting, the committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases. Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March. A few months sooner than we anticipated in early November. We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support. In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery and employment and achieve our price stability goal. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. We'll go to Rachel from the Washington Post. Thank you very much, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum employment. And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year. In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like, when will you know that that threshold has been met, and how will that be communicated? Thank you. So maximum employment, if you look at our statement of longer run goals in monetary policy strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force, and various parts of the labor force. We'd also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups, and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers. So that's a judgment for the committee to make. The committee will make a judgment that we've achieved. Our market conditions consistent with maximum employment, when it makes that it is admittedly a judgment call because it's a range of factors. Unlike inflation where we have one number that sort of dominates, it's a broad range of things. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see that in, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned. Great. Thank you. Steve at CMBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is, it's often said that monetary policy has long and variable lags. How does continuing to buy assets now, even though it's at a slower pace, address the current",-0.0002162910412249,0.0006707053223712728
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 18:40:00,2021-12-15 18:45:00," inflation problem. Won't the impact of today's changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem? Aren't you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in March that you will start to have any impact on the inflation problem? So on the first part of your question, which is why not stop purchasing now, I would just say this, we've learned that we're in dealing with balance sheet issues. We've learned that it's best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it and we thought that this was a doubling of the speed. We're basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper and we thought that was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it and that's what will happen. The question of long and variable lag is an interesting one. That's Milton Friedman's famous statement and I do think that in this world where everything is or the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly and my own sense is that they get into if the conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly longer than the traditional thought of a year or 18 months, shorter than that rather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we're going to do, the markets move immediately to that. So financial conditions are changing to reflect the forecast that we made and basically which was I think fairly in line with what markets were expecting. But financial conditions don't wait to change until things actually happen. They change on the expectation of things happening. So I don't think it's a question of having to wait. Can I just follow up thinking about having to wait? Is it still the policy or the position of the committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete? Thank you. Yes. The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation. Since we're two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then what we would stop the taper potentially sooner. But that's not something I expect to happen. But I do not think it would be appropriate and we don't find ourselves in a situation where we might have to raise rates while we're still purchasing assets. Okay, let's go to Colby at the FT. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I'm curious exactly how much distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase. Back in 2014, the guidance that was given was for the Fed Funds Rate to remain at the target level for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program. Is that an approach you support now or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different? Thank you. So we haven't made any decision of that nature. And so, no, I wouldn't say that's our position at all. We really haven't taken a position on that. I will say that we did talk today. We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example, and we went through the way the way the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet last time. And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time and that those the differences that we that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet. And the same thing would be true about raising rates. I don't I don't foresee that there would be that kind of very extended weight at this time. The economy is so much stronger. I was here at the Fed when we lifted off the last time and the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment. Inflation is running well above target and growth is well above potential. There wouldn't be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I will make this decision in coming meetings and it's not a decision that the committee has really focused on yet. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. Thank you Nick Timmeros at the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in March, you answered a question about maximum employment like this. You said 4% would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it'll take more than that to get to maximum employment. More recently, you have hinted at a possible decision.",0.0005378374951917,0.000984773880766574
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 18:45:00,2021-12-15 18:50:00," distinction between the level of maximum employment that's achievable in the short run versus in the long run. Has your view of the level of maximum employment changed this year, and if so, how? And how close is the economy right now to your judgment of the short run level of maximum employment? Thank you. Right. So the, you know, the thing is we're not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on that was the sense was that that's where we were headed. The post-pandemic labor market and the economy in general will be different. And the maximum level of employment that's consistent with price stability evolves over time within it within a business cycle and over a longer period. In part, reflecting evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those running to the pandemic. So I would say look, we're at 4.2% now and it's been, the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly. So we're already in the vicinity of 4%. The way in which the, which the important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor, labor first participation, of course, where we had widely thought, I had certainly thought that it last fall as unemployment insurance ran off as vaccinations increased as schools reopened that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge in labor first participation. So we've begun to see some improvement. We were certainly walking the two-tenths improvement that we got in the November report. But I do think that it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer. And in fact, that's been the pattern in past cycles that labor first participation has tend to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we're getting right now. So you could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong, the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in. But really, it's the pandemic, it's a range of factors, but the reality is we don't have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time. At the same time, we have to make policy now, and inflation is well above target. So this is something we need to take into account. If I could follow up, you've talked recently about risk management. And so does that mean that the committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates before you're convinced that you've achieved the employment test in your forward guidance? So this is not at all a decision that the committee has made, but you're really asking a question about how our framework works. And yes, there is a provision, it used to be called the balanced approach provision that says in effect that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum employment goal and the price stability goal are not complimentary. We have to take account of the distance from the goal and the speed at which we're approaching it. And so that is in effect an off ramp, which could in concept be taken. And it's in our framework, it's been in our framework a long time. I've talked about it on a number of occasions. It is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment. Now, we're, as I said, we're making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my thinking, in my opinion. And I don't at all know that we will have to invoke that paragraph. But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework and has been really for a very long time. Thank you. Thanks. We'll go to Howard Reuters. Thanks as usual. So I guess I got to ask about the elephant in the room, which is the home front variant. You know, this seems to already be pushing one of your colleagues and the the vanquering went off its course. Things that have all very fast there, hasn't quite hit the shores of the US in full force yet that people seem to expect it to. So I'm wondering in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more infectious but less serious variant of the virus? Or are you simply confident that the US economy can continue its divorce from the pandemic? Well, I think there's a lot of uncertainty, which is why we, why we called it out in our statement, our post-meeting statement, as a risk. We follow the same experts and we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does.",-0.0005297469107106,0.0006707053223712728

And, you know, so the earl, you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe some continuing protection from existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease. That's a first draft. We're a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be. It may well come to the United States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly that could easily happen. I think there's another step there, though, which is what's going to be the effect on the economy. And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply. It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring. On top of what's already gone on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that's hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the Eastern Seaboard. And now coming down, we're having quite a wave of Delta. So coming in on top of that, again, it's very difficult to say what the economic effects would be. I do think wave upon wave people are learning to live with this. More and more people are getting vaccinated. So people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect in the aggregate. People who are not vaccinated. So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect. It doesn't mean it won't have an economic effect. Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring. And it actually, it had an effect on global supply chains. And that sort of that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out. So it can have an economic effect. I just think at this point, we don't know much. We'll know a whole lot more in three weeks and we'll know more than that in six weeks. But if I could follow up here, if you clearly from our sort of from our wrist standpoint, the economy will be comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon. We're so to implies that whatever on the ground brings your comfortable economy can handle it without quantitative easing. Yes, yes, I look. I think if you look at the state of the economy and the amount, the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages. So I think moving, you know, moving forward the end of our taper by a few months is really, it's really an appropriate thing to do. And I think really, Omicron doesn't really have much to do with that. Thank you. It's good to gene at the New York Times. Hey, Jerk, thanks for taking our questions. And we're going to talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater weariness around inflation. Sure. So I guess I would go back and, you know, it's been a continual process really. Inflation really popped up right in the in the late spring last year. And we had a view, it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community that this would be temporary. It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it. And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said. Certainly we had five months of declining month on month, monthly readings of inflation. But we didn't see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply side issues. Then in September, I'd say after Labor Day, we started to see it started to become clear that this was both larger and it's effect on inflation. And more persistent. And of course, I said so on many occasions and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward. We move the taper forward and we, and it's a much faster taper than had been planned. So we've been adapting. I've been saying we're adapting our policy. So come to your real question. We got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting. It was the Friday before the November meeting and it was very high, 5.7% reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized for the third quarter, just before the meeting. And I thought for a second there whether we, whether we should increase our taper, decided to go ahead with what we had, what we had socialized. Then right after that we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting we got a very strong employment report and revisions to prior readings and and and no increase in labor supply. And the Friday after that we got the CPI, which was a very hot high reading. And I honestly at that point really decided that I thought we needed to, we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper and we went to work on that. So that's really what happened. It was essentially higher inflation.",-0.0005841121495326,0.001082456368282069

Really, what's happening is the unemployment rate is catching up, seems to be catching up with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, six tenths over one cycle. So that's really what happened. And widely supported in the committee today, as you can see, unanimous vote, but beyond that, I think widely supported this move. If I could just follow up quickly. You noted that the ECI was one of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don't see signs that wages are actually factoring into inflation yet. And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as you're making these assessments. Right, so what I said, you quoted me correctly. It's so far we don't see wages are not a big part of the high inflation story that we're seeing. As you look forward, let's assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get working again, and maybe there's a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing. But what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation, in particular. We don't see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently, real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on firms and they raise prices, it would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen. And we don't see that yet, but with the kind of hot labor market readings wages were seeing, it's something that we're watching. And the other thing, of course, is rents, which are very important, you know, owners are equivalent rents. That's another thing, which is very economically sensitive, unlike the things that are causing the inflation now. This is economically sensitive, and so would be expected to move up. And so as something goes down, the question is where will we be when we come out the other side of this, and we need to keep our eyes on those things. Thank you. Thanks. We'll go to Chris at the AP. Thank you. Well, next year you could see growth flowing and you could see some disinflation, particularly if your home of crime variant does spread more widely, would you delay rate heights in that situation and how would you think about that? And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through in that kind of situation with inflation fading and growth flowing? How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work? Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan. It's not something we debate, negotiate over or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be. People write down their assumptions, their assessment of appropriate policy based on their economic forecast. And so the median, what you're talking about, the three rate increases, that's the median of the committee. The median of the committee is also that growth will be 4%, and that unemployment will be 3.5% by the end of the year. So that's a really strong economy. And of course, if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate. No one will say, oh, we can't change our policy because we wrote something down in December. No one's ever said that or will. The actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast. So for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases. But we'd have to, you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them. And not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. Thank you. Let's go to Victoria, Guida at Politico. Hi, chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on maximum employment. So, you know, the new framework was basically designed as I understand it so that there was a de emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment. And basically you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation. And that's how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment. So I'm wondering, you know, you've, you've talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment. But from what I understand, and that's still basically the way that you know that you're there is inflation. So is that understanding correct? And how is, is, are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that's caused by, you know, these supply chain disruptions that might also. Lead to, you know, inflation and wages.",0.0014286332741676,0.0018400259768373694
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 19:00:00,2021-12-15 19:05:00," and those sorts of things. So how do you sort of like tease out the signal of maximum employment? Okay. So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework. This was, it really was a completely different thing. It was to do with strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly and in which there were these supply side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy of what you might call a vertical supply curve. So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate sensitive and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars but it can't because they don't have semiconductors. So that was a very different kind of inflation. This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all. It's nothing to do with our framework and the way we've approached it is really nothing to do with our framework. But come to maximum employment which is really your question, how do you know? So I think you look at prices in quantities. When you, if you want to look at maximum employment you look at prices in quantities and the main price you look at is wages. It's one of the things you look at. And you know, it's, so I mentioned a number of the things. You could get to 20 if you wanted to easily but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of, you know, prime age labor force participation in particular gets a lot of focus. The Joltz data get a lot of focus and wages. That's really one of the great signals. The quits rate is another one. The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators according to a lot of labor economists because it, people quit because they feel like they can get a better job and there's, you know, record amounts historically high levels of that going on suggesting again that you've got a very tight labor market. So on wages, that's the price indicator we look at to tell us along with all the other data whether we're, whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum employment. And so that's how we think about it. But one of the complications is that again, we've got to make policy in real time. So how do we think about that? If we think we can make labor participation might move up, if we let's say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running way above target, probably not. So you have to make an assessment that what's max, what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is one way to think about it? Just to kind of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise interest rates next year and, you know, it's, you're not certain whether you're at maximum employment, I mean, are you all going to point when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to ways in which the labor market could still improve? Yes, I mean, I absolutely. I think, well, whether or not we say, whether or not we say we're at conditions, labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment next year, we would all be open and I think expect over time that the level of maximum employment that's consistent with price stability would increase further over time, for example, through increasing participation. So we would certainly, we would not in any way want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better. But again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We've got to make that assessment in real time. Thank you. We'll go to Olivia from Bloomberg. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. And thank you for taking our questions. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force participation. And I wondered what do you think needs to change in the economy to kind of get a meaningful recovery in labor force participation and also whether running the economy hot like in the last expansion is one way of doing that. Well, the labor market is by so many measures hotter than it ever ran in the last expansion. If you think about it, you know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to vacancies is at all time highs, quits, the wages, all those things are even hotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know, that's really why is it low? It's the question. So there are a bunch of answers and all of them probably have some validity. Part of it will be that people, for certain people, they don't want to go back in the labor force because they're medically vulnerable or they're not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That's one thing. The lack of availability of childcare for caretakers is certainly part of it, not just for children, but for older people. It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people's portfolios.",0.0028317589330105,0.006945348786734359

People buy a mortgage with leverage and the, you know, with leverage and the, it has price increases. The equity they have in their home might have doubled and they might make reach the same conclusion. So there are, and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings that, because they couldn't spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers. So for all of those reasons and it's hard to know exactly the part each of them plays, we have a situation where we've had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as many has expected. And people, in effect, a good part of it is voluntary. You know, people, and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that's, that's their, certainly their choice. In other cases, it's something that will abate very quickly if, if and when the pandemic gets under control. And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know, maybe the less likely the people will come back because they're, you know, they get used to their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs. That's, that's what the evidence would say. So it's a range of things. It, it isn't that the economy lacks stimulus, you know, usually in every other expansion, it's that there aren't enough jobs and people can't find jobs and, you know, we're stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That's not the problem here. The problem is, is a supply side problem, which what it would take to work it out. I think it's going to be time. And, and number one thing it would, it would really be to have the pandemic get under control. That's what everyone would really like to see. What is the labor force? What does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that, that we'd really like to see. But, but, you know, it doesn't look like that's coming anytime soon. And just to quickly follow up on that, if some of the reason that labor force participation isn't back to, you know, February 2020 levels, because people are voluntarily making life decisions that are different, does that make you think we're going to end up at a lower rate overall? Well, there's a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But, so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down, because in aging population, the older people are the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that, that, that the trend would be lower and that over time participation would, would move down. The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020, and indeed for the year or so before that, is a good one. And I mean, I, what we can do is try to create the conditions. There's a, there's a lot of good for society when you have a, a, a tight, but stable labor market where people are coming in. They're getting into labor force. They're, they're getting paid well in a, in a, in a labor market we had before we had, you know, the, the, the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years. There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. Higher participation is one of them and we'd love to get back there. But, but again, ultimately we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation. I mean, really, it might be one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation because to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it's going to take some time. And, and, and what we need is another long expansion like the ones we've been having over the last 40 years. We've had, I think, three of the four longest in our, you know, recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history. That's what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we'd like to see. And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability. Okay, let's go to Edward Lawrence at Fox. Thanks. Thanks, Michelle. And thanks for taking the question, Chair Powell. So I was looking at its the census data for estimate monthly changes on sales. And what you're seeing is fewer people spending a restaurant and drinking places, more people spending a grocery stores. You see electronic sales down 4.6% month of a month, also department store sales down 5.4% month of a month. How concerned or what is your level of concern? The consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus or something else. Thank you. We see consumer expenses very strong in this quarter. I don't know, Edward, whether you're talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong. Incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they're getting wage increases admitted, admittedly, some of the wage increases.",0.0011855236781411,0.002566978730747655

There may be something in the seasonality that this year's holiday spending may have been pulled forward, and of course there may be effects from Delta and there might be going forward from Omicron, but fundamentally the consumer is really healthy and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter. Okay, let's go to Mike at Bloomberg. Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month's or this meeting's economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021, but barely moved for 2022 and 2023. You've said you expect inflation to fall significantly. Is that because you're going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade? In other words, is it a question of when, not if you raise interest rates and does it suggest that maybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you're behind the curve? Actually, I'm looking at the SEP here and the median forecasts for a core and headline inflation did move up by four tenths each. That's a significant, in an SEP that's a pretty significant move up. It's based on both of those things I suppose. I do think there's a broad expectation among forecasters including our own that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year. If you look at where blue chip forecasts are, which is the group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a long track record, they'll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back end of next year. I would say though as well that our policy should begin to have an effect that will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well. That's the most likely case. I guess what the thing I would want to say though is we can act as though that's a certainty and we're not going to act as though that's a certainty. There's a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased. It's certainly increased. I don't think it's high at this moment, but I think it's increased and I think that's part of the reason behind our move today is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk. I think we are in a position to deal with that risk. We need to see more data. We need to see how the inflation data and all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn't get entrenched. For one reason, as I just mentioned, it's one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment. Let's go to Michael Derby, the Wall Street Journal. Thank you, Jake, my question. As the Fed ships towards an accelerated taper, I'm wonder what you'll read is on financial stability risks right now. These periods can be, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far, but what do you see in terms of stability risks? Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now? Are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that? We have had now for a decade and more four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can hold ourselves to the same kind of framework and not just treat each event individually. There are four key areas, asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk and leverage among financial institutions. So I would say asset valuations, so I'm going to go really superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say. Debt owed by businesses and households, households are in very strong financial shape. Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low. But nonetheless, it's something we're watching. Funding risk is by and large low among financial institutions, but we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and would applaud the SEC's action this week. Leverage among financial institutions is low in the sense that capital is high.",0.0021960514134389,0.003121531153260125
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 19:15:00,2021-12-15 19:20:00," you know, financial stability, that's how I would make an overall characteristic, but we break it down to those pieces. In terms of the things that we're looking for, looking at, you know, the things we've already talked about some extent, it's the emergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic. If there were to be a variant, for example, that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy, we don't see that, we don't have any basis for thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but certainly one we're looking at. I would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyber attack is for me, you know, always the most, you know, one that we would be very difficult to deal with. I think we know how to deal with bad loans and things like that. I think more cyber attack that were to take down a major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial stability risk that we haven't actually faced yet. So I could go on with a list of horribles, but I think that's a decent picture of where I would start. How about the cryptocurrency issues, anything that worries you there that's going on in their terms of economics? Obviously, a lot of time in the net sector, is that on concern you at all? You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial stability concerns. I of course would support the views expressed in the President's Working Group report on stable coins. Stable coins can certainly be a useful, efficient consumer serving part of the financial system if they're properly regulated. And right now they aren't. And they have the potential to scale, particularly if they were to be associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist. And you could have a payment network that was immediately, systemically important, close to immediately important, that didn't have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies on the government and the Fed in particular to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency. But I do think those are longer term. In terms of the more the cryptocurrencies that are really speculative assets, I don't see them as a financial stability concern. At the moment, I do think they are risky. They're not backed by anything. And I think there's a big consumer issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they're getting. And there are certainly developments in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction. But things like the kind of leverage that's built into it and those sorts of things is certainly worth watching. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. Chair Powell. Hi Chair Powell, thanks for the question. I'm going back to inflation. Is it safe behind the current on getting inflation under control? So I would say this. I actually think we are well positioned to deal with what's coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come. I do. And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we are going to be able to do this. We've been adapting to the incoming data really all the way along and noticing and calling out that both the effects and the persistence of inflation, of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that. So we've been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer and more persistent and larger. And now we're in a position where we're ending our taper within the next, well by March in two meetings and we'll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it's appropriate. And we will. If that to the extent that's appropriate. At the same time, we're going to be seeing a few more months of data. I don't actually think we're out of position now. I think this was an important move for us to make. I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown. And I think we're reacting to that now. We'll continue to adapt our policy. So I wouldn't look at it that we're behind the curve. I would look at it that we're actually in position now.",-0.0002148227712137,0.0013765513087991446

Let's go to Evan and Market News. Hi, Chair Powell, thank you. I was wondering if we should still be seeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate. And secondly, in the last cycle, if that started shrinking the balance sheet, when short-term interest rates were about one, it's a one and a quarter percent range. Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that is time? Are these separate? So are interest rate, I mean, they are separate tools. So the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates. Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation. It just stops adding further accommodation, whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance. The extent to which they'll be separated in time is something we haven't really discussed. At the committee yet, we will be discussing that obviously in coming meetings. I don't think that the last cycle that was quite a long separation before interest rates, I don't think that's at all likely in this cycle weren't a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy. As I mentioned, the SEP meetings are for 4% growth next year, 3.5% unemployment at the end of the year, and the headline inflation of 2.6% next year, core 2.7%. So this is a strong economy, one in which it's appropriate for interest rate hikes. So they're separate, I would say. You're sorry, your second question was... The second question was about runoff. Runoff, yes. In the last cycle. So with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a first discussion of balance sheet issues today, sheet issues at our meeting this week. We'll have another at the next meeting and another after the meeting after that. I suspect these are interesting issues to discuss. Didn't make any decisions today. We looked back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was interesting and informative. But to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation. Those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time. So haven't made any decisions at all about when runoff would start, but we'll be continuing to, in relation to when either lift off happens or the end of the taper. But those are exactly the decisions we'll be turning to in coming meetings. Thank you. We'll go to Scott Horsley and MPR. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I think you said a few minutes ago that the inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that you anticipated when you crafted the framework. And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply side hiccups. Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken or is the inflation just a consequence that we have to put up with because of that? No, I'm not expressing any judgment about the stimulus in that comment. What I'm saying is there's a sense among some that you wanted inflation. This is what you wanted. How do you like it? And the truth is this is not the inflation we were, what we were talking about in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market. So we had 3.5% unemployment for a period. And we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2%. And I think in that setting, our thinking was we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than preemptive. Because no one had seen what 3.5% unemployment would look like with high labor force participation, by the way. No one had seen what it would really look like for an extended period for decades. And we didn't know what the inflation or implications were. Turned out there was barely 2% inflation and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing. So we incorporated that into our framework. This is something completely different. That's a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation. This is literally the opposite, or it has been the opposite where we have very high inflation. And we've had it since the labor market was in terrible shape. So this so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market.",-0.0026428310521905,0.0027790943168598827
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 19:25:00,2021-12-15 19:30:00," It does have to do with strong demand. Strong demand was supported by the Fed. It was supported by Congress. I'm not making any judgments on Congress. It's not my job. But I will just say we're coming out of what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime. Certainly historic, the first really global modern pandemic, which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression. So we threw a lot of support at it. And what's coming out now is really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing. People will judge in 25 years whether we over did it or not. But the reality is we are where we are. And we think our policy is the right one for the situation that we're in. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chung. Hi, Chairman Powell. I wanted to ask about the bond markets. Can you see the tenure at 146 basis points? Do you have any sort of concerns about an environment by which you might be hiking interest rates into? Would you prefer the curve be a little bit steeper? What are you cleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks? So I think the short end actions are easy to understand, which is, you know, they're basically very policy sensitive rates at the short end. And it makes sense that's reacting to changes in expectations for policy. I think a lot of things go into the long rates. And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world. Look at JGBs, look at bonds. And they're so much lower. You can get a much higher yield on US Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bonds. And you can hedge the currency risk back into Yen, back into Euros and still be way ahead. So in a way, it's not surprising that there's a lot of demand for US sovereigns in a risk-free world where there's so much, they're yielding so much more than bonds or than JGBs. So that's a big part of it. I also think, you know, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is. I don't know about that. But I would just say that we write down our own estimates of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest. Those are highly uncertain. And we'll make policy based on what we're seeing in the economy rather than based on what a model might say the neutral rate is. We all have the experience of the last cycle where we all through that cycle were trying to estimate what the neutral rate was and it turned out. I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens. We're on a cutting rate three times after raising them to an quarter to two and a half percent. So I'm not troubled by where the long bond is. I see that it's low. I mean, we're really focused on broader financial conditions. We're focused on maximum of preliminary and price stability. Thank you for the last question. We'll go to Greg Robb. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, I was wondering if I was wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about something I've heard that's been discussed that you know, your pivot towards a tighter policy hawkish policy stands had something to do with the timing of your reenomination by the president. Thank you. Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. So as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the labor market report two days after the meeting and then one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading. It was really the CPI reading and concert with those two. And I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper and we started working on that. That's a full 10 days or so before the president made a decision on re-nominating me. So honestly, it had nothing to do with that at all. And I just thought this is what we got to do. My colleagues were out talking about the faster taper and that doesn't happen by accident. They were out talking about a fast taper before the president made his decision. So it's a decision that effectively was in more than in train and to the point where people were talking about it publicly. So that's what happened. And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. We're always going to just do what we think is the right thing. And I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve. Just a quick follow up.

2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:35:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December bringing them to an end in early March. As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic. The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Amichron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High-frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. An activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs. Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Amichron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth. That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain, and we have not lost sight of the fact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health care workers on the front lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship. The labor market has made remarkable progress, and by many measures is very strong. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months. Over the past year, payroll employment has arisen by 6.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past 6 months, to reach 3.9 percent in December. The improvement in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand remains historically strong. With constraints on labor supply, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who would otherwise be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of goods and services. Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials. Like food, housing and transportation. In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability. We are committed to our price stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.",-0.000204178860682,0.0013961565965561677
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:35:00,2022-01-26 18:40:00," and we'll be watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations. The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the committee left the target range for the Federal Funds Raid unchanged and reaffirmed our plan announced in December to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we've seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2% longer run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases in WAG we expected will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Raid. Of course the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We'll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes. With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, today the committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions. These high level principles clarify that the Federal Funds Raid is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy, and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities roll off our balance sheet. Over time we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample reserves operating framework, and in the longer run we envision holding primarily treasury securities. Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals. In that regard we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach to balance sheet management in late of economic and financial developments. The committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of shrinking the balance sheet, and we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and provide additional information at the appropriate time. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, I look forward to your questions. Thank you for the first question. We'll go to Chris and we'll go to David. Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell. So, this expected that the Fed will hike rates, perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting. So I just wanted to ask, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year? Is every meeting a live meeting? And on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn't raise every meeting? Thank you. Thanks. So as I refer to in my opening statement, it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate. And so at this time, we haven't made any decisions about the path of policy. And I stress again that we'll be humble and nimble. We're going to have to navigate cross-currences and currents and actually two-sided risks now. And I'll say also that we're going to be guided by the data. In fact, what I'll say is that we're going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook. We'll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily in transparency. Transparenely. So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The labor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above our 2% target, much higher than it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven't made any decisions. Thank you. Let's go to Victoria Guida at Politico. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you were talking about the health of the labor market. And I'm curious whether you would characterize where we're at right now as maximum employment and also along those same lines. Obviously.",-0.0002949919444507,0.0012036153881092556
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:40:00,2022-01-26 18:45:00," the rate hikes on the table this year. Do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages? Sorry, just getting both parts of your question written down. So I would say, and this view is widely held in the committee that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability. And that is my personal view. And again, very broad support on the committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The other thing is maximum employment will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle. In the particular situation we're in now, it may well increase the level of maximum employment that's consistent with stable prices may increase. And we hope that it will as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises. And the policy path that we're broadly contemplating would be supportive of that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are many millions of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can raise rates and move to less accommodative and even tight financial conditions without hurting the labor market. I think there's quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market. This is by so many measures a historically tight labor market. Record levels of job openings, of quits, wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs. Plentyful look at surveys of companies, they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels really that we haven't seen in a long time, and in some cases ever. So this is a very, very strong labor market. And my strong sense is that we can move rates up without having to severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation. We hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come at the timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of growth this year, not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing and pace of that are highly uncertain, and that inflation has persisted longer than we thought. And of course, we're prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. Thank you. Let's go to Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timrose at the Wall Street Journal. I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. The statement on the balance sheet today calls for significantly reducing your holdings. What does that mean? And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And finally, how much disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales, rather than passive sales, or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you. So I'm afraid to tell you that those are all great questions. And there are questions that the committee is just turning to now. So we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a team up of the issues at this meeting. We've gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level. And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we'll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you're asking. And I expect that this process will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings. I can't tell you how many, I can't tell you how long it will take. And then, you know, at the appropriate time, we'll provide additional information. So I did the last cycle when we went through balance sheet issues. We did find that over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought. So we're just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we'll be turning to more of the details that you're asking about.",0.0004653063077376,0.0012713442325159568
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:45:00,2022-01-26 18:50:00," I would say this, the balance sheet is much bigger. It has a shorter duration than the last time, and the economy is much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So, and I think that leads you to, and I've said this, being willing to move sooner than we did in the last time, and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it's really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be. But I would point you to principle number one, which is the committee views changes in the target rate for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. So, we do want the federal funds rate. We want to operationalize that, and we want the balance sheet to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments. So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet, both restraining the economy, both tied in monetary policy, how should we think about the relationship between the two? For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every quarter percent of its point increase in your benchmark rate? So, again, we think of the balance sheet as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it's the federal funds rate. There are rules of thumbs. I'm reluctant to land on one of them that equate this, and there's also an element of uncertainty around the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and hence economic conditions. Balance sheet is still a relatively new thing for the markets, and for us, so we're less certain about that. So, again, I think the pattern we'll follow is to arrive at a timing and a pace and composition and all those things, and then announce that with advanced notice, and it will start in the background, and then we'll look to have that just running in the background and have the interest rates again be the active tool of monetary policy. That's at least the plan. I can't tell you much more about any of the very good issues that we have in the last few weeks, any kind of legal or legal or legal or legal or legal or legal or legal, and we'll have that as well. I think the plan is to have a couple of ideas, pace, composition, those sorts of things. We'll be turning to all of those at coming meetings. Thank you. Thanks. Now we'll go to Neil Irwin. Thank you, Chair Powell, some might not be desirable in some ways in achieving your your your tightening goals. So as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy, maximum employment and price stability, and financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what we're always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that of a change in financial conditions that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goal. So that's how we're looking at that. And I don't want to comment on today's financial conditions broadly, but we're not looking at any one market or so. So that's how we're thinking. In terms of what we've seen, I would say this, we said at our last meeting, we published this summary of economic projections, the meeting of which the media participant expected three rate increases this year. And you know, it's six weeks, seven weeks later now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working. Markets are now pricing in number of rate increases. Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet run off to begin at the appropriate time sometime later this year. Perhaps we haven't made that decision yet. So we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and that the financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make. And monetary policy works significantly through expectations. So that that in and of itself is appropriate. Thank you. Let's go to Howard Schneider. You know, for a year or a high thanks to your pal Howard Schneider with words. So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase. Now that we're approaching that moment, one of the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases.",-0.0002268705476654,0.000954111375359871
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:50:00,2022-01-26 18:55:00, you can't stipulate the path but how should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step? Well you're right we haven't gotten we haven't gotten to that point we haven't made a decision yet and we'll make that decision at the March meeting. We'll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate. I would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so. We have we have our eyes on on the risks particularly around the world but we do expect some softening in the economy from Amichron but we think that that should be temporary and we think that the underlines of the tax rate of the economy should you know should should show through further quickly after that. If I could follow just on relating questions the December steps had this co-pacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral given development sense then do you still think that's a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy? I path is highly uncertain and that we're committed using our tools to make sure that inflation high inflation that we're seeing does not become entrenched. So a number of factors would be it's not just monetary policy a number of factors are supporting a decline in inflation as I mentioned fiscal policy will be will prove parting significantly less of an impulse to growth we do expect this year although we do expect now that it will come slower than than we had expected and hoped that there will be relief on the supply side so that too should should lower these supply side bearers which are a big part of the story of why inflation is like in addition monetary policy will becoming significantly less accommodative. So the question is you know we'll we'll be asking this question all year long and that will be our things turning out as we expect there's a case that for whatever reason the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected we'll react to that if instead we see inflation at a higher level or more persistent level then we'll react to that and again we're well aware that this is a different economy than then existed during the last tightening cycle and our policies going to reflect those differences. Thank you let's go to Gina Smialing. Let's go to Gina. Okay let's go to Steve Leiceman. Thank you Miss Sherman thank you Miss Sherman I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle. The technical question is if you're going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won't begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes it seems to technically mean that you won't or can't begin balance sheet reduction until the summer is that correct? It's the first thing second of all you suggested that that the um uh with balance sheet running in the background that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the same time that's sort of the technical question part of it the principle question I have as you said it's going to be running in the background but the statement on on on balance sheet principle says the committees prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach based on economic and financial developments which suggests there's something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won't be running in the background so could you give us any uh a sense of the discussion or a staff presentation on what is the reaction functions surrounding the balance sheet? Thanks. So let me let me let me start by talking about that last paragraph so you'll remember during the last cycle that uh this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one and it involves inevitably surprises and so during during the years during the prior cycle we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times now we didn't intend to do that it just events required us to do so so we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we're free to do this at any time and it doesn't mean we're going to but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought we're not going to be we're not going to stick with something that isn't working that that's all that saying it's meant to be quite a general statement rather than a hint so I mean I I like to think that our you know our philosophy of the balance sheet is embodied in these principles,0.0009530725242806,0.001748370836266165
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:55:00,2022-01-26 19:00:00," So, you know, the idea that, for example, the Federal Funds Rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy that will use the determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate that will begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates. And on and on like that, I mean, those are all the things that try to describe how we will proceed. But maybe at a higher level to try to get at your question, you know, asset purchases were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function as they were right after the in the critical phase of the global financial crisis. And then after they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the economy no longer needs this highly accommodative policy that we put in place. So it's time to stop asset purchases first. And then at the appropriate time start to shrink the balance sheet. Now the balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be. We've identified the end state as, you know, amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently, effectively in the ample reserves regime. So there's a substantial amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done. That's going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable. So those are some of the ways I would think this lays out our, you know, the way we were thinking about this. In terms of the timing, I can't really help you. You know, it just says after we get underway. So we're, I would say we are, we're going to have another discussion at the next meeting. And I guess as we'll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that. And you know, we'll, we'll, we'll tell you as we make progress. And we'll, you know, we'll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet, what we find to be the appropriate time. It's, I wish I could say more, but honestly, we haven't made those decisions and we actually haven't even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings. Thank you. Let's go to correct or is. Chair Powell, Chair Powell, good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell, correct or is from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you said risks are too cited. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing? Is fed policy a risk over tightening? Or what are the risks? And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question. You know, Robert Kaplan's disclosure of his securities transactions and a couple months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns and we'll list transactions and all kinds of things. And next to those transactions, we'll put dates. And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr Kaplan's transactions. The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates. And I don't see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else. I mean, why can't he give us the dates? Will you help us get the dates of those transactions? Thanks. So you asked about the risks first. So you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and certainly in my view as well. There's a risk that the high inflation we're seeing will be prolonged and there's a risk that it will move even higher. So we don't think that's the base case, but you ask what the risks are. And we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes. And that calls for us to be in position. We have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we've got to be in a position to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher. And of course, that is a risk to the expansion. You know, we've been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last, which is the record long expansion. We saw labor force participation rise. We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end. There really was no obvious imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion it could have gone on for years. We're not hit by the pandemic. So we'd love to find a way to get back to that. That's going to require price stability and that's going to require the Fed to tighten",-0.0007934888571492,0.0017023015116437424

One, the COVID is not over and COVID can continue to evolve. And it's just we have to accept that it's not over and the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be that's sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint. Another point to, you know, another risk is just further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that's their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns. It's likely to and that may play into may play into more problems in supply chains. In addition, there's what's going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there's plenty of risk out there. And we, you know, we can't forget that there are risks on both sides. So that's there. That's what I would say. I know you've been all over this issue with my colleagues Craig on the issue of information. We don't have that information at the board. And, you know, I asked the inspector general to do an investigation. And that is out of my hands. I have playing no role in it. I seek to play no role in it. And I don't, I really, I can't help you here today on this issue. And I'm sorry I can't. Thank you. We'll go to Gina now. Thanks for taking our question to Chair Powell and the sorry for my tech issues. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where you're thinking on inflation stands today. You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year. And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one. And if you're thinking it's changed at all, I wonder how you're thinking about that. And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deserteration. Like how do we get from here 7% CPI to where you expect to be at the end of the year. So I'd say, you know, since since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same, but probably slightly worse. I'd be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation. Let's just go with that by a few tents today. But we're not writing down an SEP at this meeting, but I think it hasn't gotten better. It's probably gotten just a bit worse. And that's been the pattern. That's been the pattern. So I think if you look at the FOMC participants are there's a range there. And that range has been moving to the right for a year now. And by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you've seen the same pattern. So what do we think about that? Well, I think we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually. And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that. If it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned, though, I think it's part of this will be that we're the Fed moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy. And then over time to a policy that's not accommodative in time. I don't know when that will be. That's those are the things that we're thinking about. That's that's part of it. Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years. That impulse will be less. In fact, will be will be negative this year. And so that's another thing. The other one is we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And you know, the ports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now what what we're learning is it's just taking much longer. I think longer than expected. And that I think does raise raise the risk that in that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think will come off of the highs that we saw in the in the early part of this episode in the in the spring last year. But really what's the question is going to be what what is inflation running at. And so we'll be watching that. And I you know we our objective is to get inflation back down to 2%. And it's also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very very.",0.0041738855798106,0.008059206792435722

We see it particularly among production and non-supervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other indicators. So I think that's what we're looking at. And we're also, you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we're going to have to adapt it. And we're going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we're going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move as appropriate. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Cole B. Smith. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path for for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and say doing a 50 basis points hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently? And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle? So as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions. We really haven't. And what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, 16, 17, 18, when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2%, even below 2%. Unemployment was not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was, you know, in the 2% to 3% range. Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2%, and, you know, more persistently than we would like. We have growth even in forecast, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022. We still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where by so many measures, it is historically tight. I think the, you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you're seeing, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed, you're seeing a very, very tight labor market. Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It's a percentage point and a half lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a percentage point of that is retirements. Some part of those retirements are related to COVID rather than just regular retirements. So we think there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force. But it's not happening very quickly, and it may not continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on. So that's how we think about that. We haven't made to your specific question. We really have not addressed those questions, and we'll begin to address them as we, as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that. Let's go to Rachel. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower income earners. Are you worried that the Fed underestimates or can't effectively measure the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households? Thank you. So it's more a matter of, I think the problem that we're talking about here is really that people are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck. They're spending most or all of their of what they're earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that's really the point. I don't, I'm not aware of inflation literally falling more on different socio-economic groups. That's not the point. The point is some people are just really prone to suffer more. I mean, for people who are economically well off inflation isn't good. It's bad. High inflation is bad, but they're going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive their cars and things like that. It's more, so that's really how I think of it. And, you know, we, we, um,",-0.0008134122644492,0.004388544541464955

Thank you. Let's go to Edward Lawrence. Thanks, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for taking the question here. So year over year, inflation is at 40 year high the input costs for producer pricing decks for all of 2021 was the highest on record. Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late. Now you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today. And as a follow that because I have problems with the mute button. As a follow that you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked up at the end of the year. You talked about that today. The CEO for the toll fox business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023. So today you said inflation will start to ease this year. I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we can see that relief. Thank you. So I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of the year. I do not expect them and I have not expected them. What I would say and I have been saying is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly progress because we're not making much progress. If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times or shorters and inventories and some industries moving up. Overall, we're not making progress and things like the semiconductor issue are going to be quite a long time. I would think they'll go more than through to 2023. In terms of being too late, I would just say this, our policy needs to be positioned to adjust the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said. Particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher more persistently than we'd expected. We think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that and we're committed to doing that. That's really where we are. In terms of your question about the size of rate increases, we haven't faced those decisions. We haven't made them. It isn't possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the precise path will be. But in as we work our way through this meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different expansion. As I said a couple times with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy. And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in the policy that we implement. Thank you. Let's go to Mike McKee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is, are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2% do you want to go below 2% so that on average you get a 2% inflation rate. And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side? So no, there's nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2%. So that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the answer to that is no. What we're trying to do is keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2%. That's always the ultimate goal. And we do that in the service of having inflation, we get to that goal by having inflation average 2% over time. And if inflation doesn't average 2% over time, then it's not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2%. So that's the way we think about that. What was the last part of your question? I was asking if you're protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there's some sort of circuit breaker there. Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market and you have growth this year at forecast to be well above potential. I mean, people are forecasting growth. You think potential growth is around two most forecasts are significantly above that for 2022. And that's even with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market's going to be strong for some time.",-0.0066707369468377,0.009504923413566646
2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 19:15:00,2022-01-26 19:20:00," And ideally, what we're trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent. And we're trying to do that in a process that accomplish that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take. Again, I would say that it isn't just monetary policy that's helping inflation get down. It'll be supply side improvements and it'll be less fiscal impulse in all likelihood. So monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent and a situation where the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one. But I don't really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation. And also high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these large wage increases that we're seeing now. So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve both of those goals. If I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent and making decisions rather than the state dependency you've been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so? What I see was particularly around the thought that if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation before we tightened. And so that was a very state dependent thought because for a long time we'd been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared. And that was the case for a number of years. So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook. Let's go to Michael Derby. Thank you for taking my question. When I ask you, with the benefit of hindsight and I realize I mean that is what it is, but do you feel that monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we're having right now is because the government in response collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing? So I think it's too soon to write that history really. But what I would say is this, if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks and there are no vaccines and it could be a really long time to get them. And then you have economic activity drops by a shocking amount in one course. So there was a real risk of lasting damage. And I think Congress responded remarkably with the CARES Act, incredibly timely, very powerful. People will always be flaws in these things. But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded and what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act. So now that was a lot of, that was a lot. And what we did was a lot. And you know, now, so what we have now is we have the strongest recovery of any country and we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we've had because we've put so much support behind the recovery. And we're managing the relatively high class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and labor shortage. So and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we're working as hard as we can on. Was it too much? Again, I'm going to leave that to the historians. But in 25 years, we'll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, two, three, four, five-year period and we'll say, you know, we'll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took. It was all founded though in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event. And I guess I'll have to leave it that I look for, I hope I, I hope I'll be around to see how that looks in 25 years. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Gene Young. Thanks, Michelle. Thanks, Michelle.

So we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don't control the slope of the yield curve. Many factors influence longer term interest rates, but it is something that we watch in, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago. And we take it into account along with many other financial conditions as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that's one thing I would say. Another is currently you've got a slope if you think about two's to tens, two, two, three to ten, or a treasury, I think that's around 75 basis points. That's well within the range of a normal yield curve slope. So it's something we're monitoring. We don't think of it as, I don't think of it as some kind of an iron law, but we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what is telling us, and it's one of many things that we monitor. Can I follow up real quick and ask if it did invert, would you tie it to US fundamentals or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors? We know that's a good question in real time. Obviously, the US long-term sovereign debt is an important global asset, and the fact that our rates are so much higher than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our rates, I don't know. But it would really depend on the facts and circumstances at that time. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chong for the last question. I'm Chairman Powell Brian Chong, Yahoo Finance. Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking? And then secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it's often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don't merge. Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates? Thanks. I would describe what we're doing along these lines. This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that's going to involve a number of things. It's going to involve, it does involve finishing asset purchases. It's going to involve lifting off, and it's going to involve additional rate increases. It has appropriate. And we're going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be. It's going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this. The last thing we're going to do is we're going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and do so in a predictable manner. And that's something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I wouldn't, I don't think it's possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we're going to need to be, as I've mentioned, nimble about this. And the economy's quite different this time. I've said this several times now. The economy's quite different. It's stronger, inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much stronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make monetary policy. And you asked about financials to be out of concerns. In connection with our policy, was that your question? Yeah, within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that. I didn't know if that was part of the discussion today. I would just say this, we of course have a financial stability framework. And what it shows is a number of positive aspects of financial stability. But you mentioned really asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don't really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability. And that's because households are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape financially. Defaults on business loans are low in that kind of thing. The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.

2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:35:00," Good afternoon. I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia's invasion. The human toll is tragic. The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us. The economic employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by one quarter percentage point. The economy is very strong and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the Federal Funds Rate will be appropriate. In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. Economic activity expanded at a robust 5.5% pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year, but cases have declined sharply since mid-January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief. Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8% this year, 2.2% next year, and 2% in 2024. The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs. In February, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8%, a bit below the median of committee participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African-Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of this year, and remaining near that level thereafter. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. These supply disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services. Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability. As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate farming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2%, while the labor market remains strong. That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price stability goal than previously expected. The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 4.3% this year, and falls to 2.7% next year and 2.3% in 2024. This trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside. The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. As I noted, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1.25% point, and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate.",-0.0020403855625132,0.0037429378531072858
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:35:00,2022-03-16 18:40:00," is 1.9% at the end of this year, a full percentage point higher than projected in December. Over the following two years, the median projection is 2.8%, somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. At our meeting that wrapped up today, the committee made good progress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting. In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability. As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the US economy are highly uncertain. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the US economy through trade and other channels. The volatility in financial markets, particularly of sustained, could also act to tighten credit conditions and affect the real economy. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already and extraordinarily challenging in uncertain moment. We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations. The committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Let's go to Gina at the New York Times. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you're considering the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you're weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded and getting behind the curve. So I guess I would start by saying that in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated. And why do I say that? Aggregate demand is currently strong and most forecasters expected to remain so. If you look at the labor market, also very strong, conditions are tight and payroll job growth is continuing at very high levels. Household and business balance sheets are strong. And so all signs are that this is a strong economy, indeed, one that will be able to flourish, not to say it withstand, but certainly flourish as well, in the face of less accommodative monetary policy. So I guess that's how I would say I'm looking at that. Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. And that is our overall objective. But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy. Thank you. Let's go to Howard at Reuters. Hi, Chair Bill. I was wondering in the in the steps you have quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8%. I'm wondering how much of that do you feel is the results of the Fed's stiffer than expected action here? I mean, talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected? I don't think that's a big piece of it, actually. I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels, highly uncertain, but you're looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. It'll be, so we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent. So that's part of what moved the assessment stand. I don't think, I mean, I think generally monetary policy works with a lag. So some of that would also be in there, but remember as well, that 2.8% is still very strong growth. If we think that the potential growth for the economy is somewhere between...",0.0051703877790834,0.006895902468874313
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:40:00,2022-03-16 18:45:00," somewhere around 1-3-quarters percent, 2.8 percent, is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion. So while it's lower than last year's 5.8 percent, it's still quite strong growth. That's so I would say it's quite a strong forecast. So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes, ongoing increases? Doesn't really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly pace through the year. So, you know, the way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting, and we're going to be looking at evolving conditions. And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, to remove accommodation, then we'll do so. I can't be perfectly specific about it, but that's certainly a possibility as we go through the year. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Rachel at the Washington Post. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation, we'll start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better. And if you don't start to see that, how will you signal it? What will you be looking for, and what will you be looking for over the course of the year? Thank you. So, I guess I would say that before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, so let's go back to that, I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower, and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So, now we're, you know, we're getting, we're going, we're already seeing a little bit of short-term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas a little bit, but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices. The other thing is that you're seeing supply chain issues around shipping, and around, you know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods. So, that's going to be more, more tangled supply chains. So, that could actually push out the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally. So, I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year, but if you look at where, though, I read the, the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect, though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we've seen so far this year, we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down and then come down more sharply next year. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, over the last six months, the fetish shifted its policy stands quite a bit. Six months ago, you were still buying assets. Most officials weren't projecting any interest rate increases this year. And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then. So, how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy? Thanks. So, that's one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that the committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to the economy is very strong. As I mentioned, tremendous momentum in the labor market, we expect growth to continue. As I, it's clearly time to raise interest rates and begin to balance sheet shrinkage. And I just wanted to say that, as I looked around the table at today's meeting, I saw a committee that's acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and determine to use our tools to do exactly that. You couched it in terms of real rates. I would say, if you look at the SEP, you've got people getting close to or even above in many cases, their estimate of the longer run neutral rate. So, I understand that doesn't do it for real rates. But if you go out a year or two, many people are in their forecasts or having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint. So, that's something that we're focused on. Of course, it's a highly uncertain environment. And we don't...",0.0036009072415646,0.004913085183538745
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:45:00,2022-03-16 18:50:00," know what's going to happen and what we do know that we're going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals and that includes the price stability goal. Let's go to Victoria at Politico. Hi Chair Powell. So looking at the summary of economic projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3%. And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that's a little bit uncertain. So I was just wondering how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates? And then also if I could just ask given that Sarah Blumraskin withdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio? Do you expect to assign a governor in charge of that? Okay, so sorry, tell me, tell me again your first question. My first question is how much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed actions? Okay, so part of it, part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy and those would include potentially supply chains getting a little bit better. Certainly base effects, you're lapping as you know, when you look at a 12 month trailing window, you're lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year. So there should be some effects from that in the 12 month picture. Really what we're looking for though is month by month inflation coming down. And so it's really it's all the things we've been talking about, you know, that really haven't helped much, including the shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including work labor force participation, all those things that have been sticky and not happening. But a big part of it is though is is the base effects I mentioned as well. You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation and on growth with a lag of course. And so you would see that more in in in 23 and 24. But also remember, we started talking about rate increases last year for some months now. Financial conditions, conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases. So it doesn't start today. The effect the moves are already priced into the market for for a few months now. So so the clock is running on that. And I think some of that will be seen in the in the second half of the year as well. And on so on the regulatory portfolio. So I would just say this, you know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in the in supervision and regulation. And we're doing that. That's that's what we're doing. The committee is is not active. So what's happening is things are coming to the full board. And we're voting on them. We're getting our business done. You know, we've got the stress test done. We've we've looked at it, you know, number of proposals for mergers and things like that. So we are we are we're working ahead. Of course, we don't have a vice chair for supervision as you mentioned. But we're we're we're making do with with the situation we have and a good number of things have come straight to the board for approval. Let's go to Neil Irwin at exios. Let's go to Neil Irwin. Hi, chair Powell. It's Neil Irwin at exios. Thanks for taking our questions. And the statement back out projections. We see a forecast of a median 1.9% fed fund rate at the end of the year, 2.8. And then next year, wondered whether that aligns with your own expectations, in particular, on that point of overshooting the long term neutral rate. And also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced, front loaded, back loaded, how high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting? So I don't, Neil, I've never talked about my own SEC, SEP projection. It's in there. But I, I think fed chairs have generally not done that because we just haven't done it. It's because we're, you know, we're we have to put together the the consensus on the committee and present that consensus. So I wouldn't talk about my my individual one. And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is their seven remaining meetings this year. This isn't something we discuss or debate or agree on, but there's seven remaining meetings and there's seven rate hikes. I would add, there's also the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which you can people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rating increase just from the the runoff of the balance sheet. So I don't, but I don't know, we haven't made any decisions on front end loading or or or going steadily through the year. And as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven rate increases this year. And",0.0004893051866349,0.003684055442573045

We'll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation. We'll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgment. And we'll be going, each meeting is a live meeting. And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we'll do so. One second. Okay, we're gonna try one more time. Colby Smith at the FT. Okay, we'll come back to Colby. Let's go to Edward Mars. Yeah, thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you, Michelle, for the question. I have a more basic question. The last time this CPI inflation, I know you're looking at PCE, but CPI inflation was as high as it is was July of 1981 when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2%. But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the federal reserve is in your mind? So I just would say a couple of things. Have the tools that we need, and we're going to use them. And as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet. We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched while also supporting a strong labor market. As I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we'll do so. I'll leave it to others to make the judgment you ask for. And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this. What impact has there been on your job given the fact that you lost you in the middle of a question? Edward, can you repeat that question? The impact that given you're not actually confirmed and Governor Brainer does not actually confirmed is there been any impact on your job or the if feasibility to handle inflation? None whatsoever. OK, let's go to Colby Smith, the FT. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, how does the committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self-correct? And to what extent does it alter both the committee's confidence that long-term inflation expectations will not de-anchor in the coming months, as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot bot. Thank you. So of course, that's something we're watching report by report and certainly what we noticed in the last meeting. And it's part of the overall picture. We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was. And that's part of what's happening is in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis. In other cases, it's pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services. And yes, that is concerning. In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side, but really, at this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is admittedly a large category. So as I mentioned, the committee acutely feels its obligation to move, to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so. Thank you. Let's go to Steve.",0.0020610873691442,0.004222460691457104
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:55:00,2022-03-16 19:00:00," at CNBC. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me understand the kind of logic if there is one in the SEP here. As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three-year window below the long run rate. I look at inflation being above over the three-year window, the long run or call it the neutral rate so the economy still runs hot. And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years, the funds rate above the long run rate. So the other question is this, are you not giving forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further behind the curve and never really get in front of inflation because the economy will continue to run hot. And kind of on a related issue, you said earlier inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected. Isn't that a choice you're making? And if so, why are you making that choice to the rental inflation run above price stability longer than you'd like? Right, so if you look, first of all, you're looking at medians, but understand that there's not something we voted on, it's not a plan. But if you look, people do have their... By the end of this year, broadly people are at or close to, or in some cases above, their estimates of longer run neutral interest rate. That should stop pushing, that should, in other words, that should be removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically. At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff, and you can think of that as further. In the next year, and just looking at the median, you're now above the, above the, what people estimate to be the longer run median. And also in many people's forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy in real rates as well. So why doesn't, why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent? You know, it, I mean, a couple points. One is the connection between, in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight. But this is clearly what this is, is an expectation that really it amounts to, that the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to, to levels, which are still very attractive, full economy, kind of, full employment, kind of wages, but not, not, not to a point where they're pushing up inflation anymore. And as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down. And, you know, the reality is there, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don't know what will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. And so we, we are determined on that front and we'll deal with what comes. This is, this is a modal or most likely expectation, but we will, we'll deal with what comes, whether it's better or worse. Thank you. Let's go to Chris Rougaber at the AP. Hi, thank you. Well, let me follow up a bit on that. I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can. Reduce inflation as much as you've penciled in without raising the unemployment rate. And I'm wondering just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand. I mean, outside housing and autos. How do higher fed rates reduce consumer demand unless it's through higher unemployment? Thank you. Well, if you take a look, take a look at today's labor market. What you have is 1.7 plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that's, that's a very, very tight labor market. Tight to it to an unhealthy level, I would say. So in principle, if you were, if, or if, let's say that our tools work about as you described. And the idea is we're trying to better align demand and supply. Let's just say in the labor market. So it would actually, if, if, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on wages. You would have, you would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy. We're hearing from companies that they can't hire enough people. They're having a hard time hiring. So that's, that's really the, the thinking there is.",-0.000743719060125,0.0036520970480820518
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 19:00:00,2022-03-16 19:05:00," You know, these are fairly well-understood channels. Inter-sensitive, and basically across the economy, we'd like to slow demand so that it's better lined with supply, gives supply at the same time, time to recover, and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand, and that over time should bring inflation down. And I'll say again, though, you know, we don't have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we're prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability. You know, with, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, you really can't have a sustained period of maximum employment. It's our, one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability. So we're very committed to that. Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention, and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability. Okay, let's go to Scott Horsley at NPR. Thanks, and I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr. Chair. I think I missed some of your answer there, but I haven't followed a question on the labor force. We have seen some gains in the prime age workforce in the last few months. I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed. Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back in the workforce? And what would that mean for wages and inflation? It's hard to say, you know, the, what we saw in the last cycle was that over the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations. And that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market. It wasn't, it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market, but it was a tight labor market. And so people stayed in the labor force longer. It wasn't so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement. That's not something that happens in the aggregate very much. But so that's what was happening. And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome. And of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that. This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time. And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better paying jobs in the same industry or different industry. So it's a really attractive labor market for people. And once, you know, as we get past COVID, well and truly, it becomes even more attractive. Once we hope that that will lead to more labor supply, that's a good thing for the country. It's a good thing for people. And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk. That last part is you will have to see whether empirically it winds up works out that way. But in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well. It's not the only thing we're looking for, though, from inflation. We're looking for help from another different, a number of different places and most importantly, from our own policy. OK, let's go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg. Thank you. Michelle, thank you, Chair Powell. I'm sorry I'm having some communication problems. So I've missed some of the stuff you've said in my apologies if this has been asked. Since the FOMC met in last January, financial conditions have tightened markedly equity prices down, treasure yields up, bond spurs, risen yield pervage flat in a lot, and even further this today, it's out there itself. Is that welcome? And would you like to see more in order to achieve your goals? Thank you. So as you know, policy works through financial conditions. That's how it reaches the real economy, by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive and appropriately so fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy. The monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic. So it is very appropriate to move away from those. And yes, that will lead to some tightening and financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things. We're not targeting any one or more of those things. But financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level. So that because we know the economy no longer needs or wants these very highly accommodative stance, which it's time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions. And we do that by moving by term.",0.001825878631405,0.0039358159249167374
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 19:05:00,2022-03-16 19:10:00," policy itself to more normal levels. What do you say move to more normal setting for financial conditions that suggests to me that you want financial conditions that tighten further from where we are now? Am I drawing the right inference from that? Well, yes. So I would say we look at a broad range of financial conditions and of course when we tighten monetary policy we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy. It's not any particular financial condition but a broad range of financial conditions. They will reflect to some extent, they reflect any number of things. But yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy and it does thrust us through financial conditions which means as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that it's at least less accommodative that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative. Thank you. Just a little housekeeping note. Most of you in this call may be having some tech issues. If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly on www.fedorreserve.gov. You might go there for the audio. And now we'll go to Jean Young. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you've had at this meeting. Can you give us any more details? Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs or whether to increase those caps over what period event if there were any details? Yes, thank you for asking. So at our meeting today and yesterday we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet. And I'd say we're now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we're actually beginning runoff at a coming meeting and that could come as soon as our next meeting in May. That's not a decision that we've made, but I would say that that's how well our discussions went in the last two days. So a couple of things just to add, we'll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context to when we make the decision on timing. And we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability. We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what's a highly uncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this. In terms of the, I would say this, I don't want to get too much into the details because we're literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this. But it'll be faster than the last time and of course it's much sooner in a cycle than last time. But it will look familiar to you. And I would also say that there'll be, I'm sure there'll be a more detailed discussion of our, in the minutes to our meeting that come out in three weeks where I expect that it will lay out pretty much the parameters of what we're looking at, which I think will look quite familiar. Thank you. Let's go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you've been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down. That seems to be over, but I'm wondering how you would describe your reaction function now. What is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down it? As in other words, is it, we're going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level? Yeah, so I want to clear one thing up again and that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates. What we said in the framework changes was, and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades actually. What we said was if we see low unemployment, high employment, but we don't see inflation, then we're not going to raise rates until we actually see inflation. That's what we said, and that was the sense of it. There was no sense in which if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates. That's simply not in the framework. In fact, quite the contrary, the framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2%. So I do hear this, you know, that the framework, really, we can't blame the framework. It was a sudden unexpected burst of inflation, and then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was, but it was not in any way caused or related caused by or related to the framework. So come to today. You know, I think our vision on this on the committee is very, very clear. What we see is a strong labor market. We see a labor market with a lot of...",-0.0013350204896622,0.004562171221079045
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 19:10:00,2022-03-16 19:15:00," momentum, great job creation, and we see the underlying economy strong, balance sheets are strong. Yes, there are threats to growth from what's going on in Eastern Europe. But nonetheless, in the base case, there's a pretty broad expectation of strong growth. But inflation is far above our target. And the help we've been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better, it hasn't come. And so we're looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we're committed to doing that. And you see that, I think, in the summer of economic projections. And you see that in the decision we make, and you will continue to see it in the decisions we make going forward. If I could follow up by asking, I guess what you'd call it is the Paul Volker question. You don't think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates? Well, the goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. We have a dual mandate in there sort of equal. But as I said earlier, price stability is an essential goal. In fact, it's a precondition really for achieving the kind of labor market that we want. Which is a strong and sustained labor market. We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market. It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion. It's just the pandemic arrived, just to completely exogenous event. So that's how we're thinking about it. We of course want to achieve price stability with a strong labor market. But we do understand also that really you can't have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability. So we need to focus on price stability in particular, particularly because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chung at Yahoo. I turn around. Hopefully no tech issues here on this front. Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed's doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SCP is. How is the 25 basis point height today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they're feeling at the stores on a daily basis? Sure. So I guess I'd start by just assuring everyone that we're fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people's well-being. And really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone, but really especially on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation where I mean, we've all seen charts that show if you're a middle income person, you've got room to absorb some inflation. If you're at the lower end of the income spectrum, it's very hard because you're spending most of your money already on necessities and the price is going up. But it's punishing for everyone. So it has been a difficult time for the economy, but we do anticipate that the inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier. It may take longer than we like, but I'm confident that we'll use our tools to bring inflation down. And you ask about rates. So the way that works, I would explain is as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it's better match with supply, and that brings, that will bring inflation down over time. That's our plan. Thank you. Let's go to Joe Lincant at NBC News. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking my question doing this today. My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked. What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation? Well, that is, yes, indeed. I mean, as I just said, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take the heart that it's our obligation to restore price stability. We've had price stability for a very long time, and maybe come to take it for granted. But now we see the pain. I'm old enough to remember what very high inflation was like, and we're strongly committed as a committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched, and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal.",0.0020694224867479,0.002581815644407261
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 19:15:00,2022-03-16 19:20:00," levels, which are target is 2 percent inflation. So we will do that. And I just want people to understand that. But the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet. And so financial conditions will become at the margin less supportive of various kinds of economic activity. That will slow the economy while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong. The good news is the economy and the labor market are quite strong. And that means the economy we think can handle interest rate increases. And if you look follow up to that, obviously the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line trying to avoid a recession for the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs at a possible recession, what do you say to that? Well, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent while still sustaining a strong labor market. And that the economy is very strong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecast in growth that's strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output. So and we expect that to continue. And to the extent the data come in different, then of course our policy will adapt. But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast and we believe we can bring down inflation. We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market. The labor market is it's not strong in the ordinary sense of the world. We haven't worked. We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person. Or whether if you add job openings to those who are employed, that's actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce. So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply. And when that happens, prices go up. And so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back. And we don't think we need to do this alone. There will be other factors helping that happen. But we certainly are prepared to use our tools and we will. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Simon at the Economist. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute. Now I ask about the sanctions on Russia and specifically the freezing of the Central Bank assets. Of course that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies' potential. Any concerns about in the long term how this might affect the dollar status as the permanent global reserve currency and in the past couple of weeks have you had to deliver any points of reassurance to other central bankers around the world? Well so of course central bankers around the world are generally very favorable of these sanctions. But let me say this, sanctions are really the business of the elected government and that's true everywhere. And the administration, the Treasury Department in particular and other agencies, they create these sanctions. We're there to provide technical expertise but it's not our decisions. So I'm reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because again they're not for us. We have a very specific mandate and these are really the province of elected governments as I mentioned. So I'd have to leave it at that. Sorry. Thank you. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. I'm here to talk a lot about rising wages which on the one hand is a great thing. But are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage crisis spiral? So the way I would say it is this. We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing. That's how the standard of living rises over time. And generally it's driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a, we're blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now they're all showing the same thing which is that the increases, not the levels, but the increases are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2% inflation or goal over time. And that may be, we don't know how persistent that phenomenon will be. It's very hard to say. And that's really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage-price spiral is, is that something that's going to start happening and become entrenched in the system? We don't, we don't see-",0.0026216272649236,0.0042522539269448465
2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 19:20:00,2022-03-16 19:24:28," that. You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level. But it comes back to what I'm saying here, which is there is a misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market. And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so we need to use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2%. And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market. We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy and the overall economy can as well. But yes, wages are moving up faster than it's consistent with 2% inflation. But it's good to see them moving up, but it wouldn't be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher. And that's because of this misalignment between supply and demand. We expect to get more labor supply. We did last time. We got more than we expected last during the last cycle. This time we've gotten much less than expected. So it's not easy to predict these things. But we do expect that we'll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people's lives, something we all wish. But so that's how we think about it. Thank you. And for the last question, we'll go to Don Lee at LA Times. Hi, Chair Powell. I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that in hindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier. And it sounds like today that you don't think that the Fed is late. And just wanted to get your clarification on that. And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is behind the curve, how much behind the curve is it? Right. So we are not, we don't have the luxury of 2020 hindsight in actually implementing real time decisions in the world. So the question is, the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time? But that's not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now. So I think if we knew now, of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages really and the inflation resulting from them in collision with very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to move earlier. Obviously it would be. But again, we don't have that luxury. And then so that's a separate question from your other question, which is behind the curve. And I don't have the luxury of looking at it that way. We are, we have our tools, powerful tools, and the committee is very focused on using them. We're acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market. And what I saw today was a committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability in particular and prepared to use our tools to do that. We're not going to let high inflation become entrenched. The costs of that would be too high. And we're not going to wait so long that we have to do that. No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on in order to get inflation back down. So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practically can. And then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate. And as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense, it just to people's SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer run neutral rates. And there's also a range of estimates too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP. But thanks for your question. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks, Mr. Chair. Thank you.",0.0014114815928915,0.00261574074074073
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:35:00," Good afternoon. It's nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple of years. Before I go into the details of today's meeting, I'd like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people. Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we're moving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy in the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a half percentage point, and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. After expanding at a robust 5.5 percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter. Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports to volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth. Indeed household spending and business fixed investment continue to expand briskly. The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first three months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs. In March, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic and near five decade low of 3.6 percent. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African-Americans and Hispanics. Employers demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. Employers are having difficulties filling job openings and wages arising at the fastest pace in many years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12-month ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. Disruptions to supply have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that result from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation, and COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine. Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain. In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to restoring price stability. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. At today's committee meeting, at today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point and stated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. We also decided to begin the process of reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in forming the stance of monetary policy. We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations.

2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:35:00,2022-05-04 18:40:00," broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings. We'll make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal. With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings. Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner. By allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts. For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $60 billion per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and to the extent that coupon securities are less than the monthly cap Treasury bills. For agency mortgage-back securities, the cap will be 17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase the $35 billion per month. At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount. Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals, and in that regard, we'll be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive, attentive to inflation risks. The committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Nick Chamero, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6% in March is now essentially at the level that the committee had expected would prevail over the next three years, and at the bottom end of FOMC participants' projections for the longer-run rate that you submitted in the projections at the last meeting. How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What does this imply for your inflation forecast? And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession? Thanks. Thank you. You're right, 3.6% unemployment is just about as low as it's been in 50 years. I would say that I expect and committee members generally expect that we'll get some additional participation. People will be coming back into the labor force. We've seen that particularly among prime age people, and that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow. Job creation has been at more than half a million per month in recent months, very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy. And so we think with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation. Implications for inflation, really that wages matter a fair amount for companies particularly in the service sector. Wages are running high, the highest they're running quite some time. And they are one good example of our good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is. The fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example.",0.0045205776695518,0.007678933642422503
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:40:00,2022-05-04 18:45:00," of vacancy filling and things like that and more people coming back in. We like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that therefore wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases but not but ones that are more consistent with 2% inflation. That's our expectation. Your third question was your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downturn. So I guess I would say it this way. There's a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level. There are 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11 and a half million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people. And we haven't been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy unemployed curve, the beverage curve. We haven't been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era. So in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand we could see vacancies come down and as a result and they could come down fairly significantly and I think put supply and demand at least closer together than they are and that that would give us a chance to have lower to get inflation down, get wages down and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there's a path to that. Now I would say I think we have a good chance to have a soft or soft-ish landing or outcome if you will and I'll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is households and businesses are in very strong financial shape. You're looking at excess savings on balance sheets excess in the sense that they're substantially larger than the prior trend. Businesses are in good financial shape. The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong and so it doesn't seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. But before the economy is strong in his well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. But I'll say I do expect that this will be very challenging. It's not going to be easy and it may well depend, of course, on events that are not under our control. But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome and that's what we're going to do. Steve? Steve Lee's been CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You talked about using 50 basis point rate hacks or the possibility of them in coming meetings. Might there be something larger than 50, is 75 or a percentage point possible? And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration. Why one month or one meeting should be expected 50? Why something bigger? Why something smaller? What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening? Thank you. Sure. So 75 basis point and it increases not something the committee is actively considering. What we are doing is we raised 50 basis points today and we've said that again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations. There's a broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis increases should be on 50 basis point, and it should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we're going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we'll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions. And finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve. So the test is really just as I laid it out, economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations. And I think expectations are that we'll start to see inflation flattening out. And not necessarily declining yet, but we'll see more evidence. We've seen some evidence that the core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out. We want to know more than just some evidence. We want to really feel like we're making some progress there. But I mean, we're going to make these decisions and there will be a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It's a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So we're leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there. I'm sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate towards a lower increase in the funds rate or a- I don't think the one month is not- No, no. One month's reading would not- it doesn't tell us much. We'd want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a-",0.0068161090577448,0.01062827476806236
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:45:00,2022-05-04 18:50:00," direction that gives us more comfort. As I said, we've got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we're not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled. That inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down. But again, it's not like we would stop. We would just go back to 25 basis point increases. It'll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. Again, our expectation is if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 basis point increases on the table, the next two meetings. Thanks. Let's go to Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith in the financial times. Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed's target at your end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the Fed funds rate? And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year? So neutral. When we talk about the neutral rate, we're really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down. So it's a concept, really. It's not something we can identify with any precision. So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty. And the current estimates on the committee are sort of two to three percent. And also, that's a longer run estimate. That's an estimate for an economy that's at full employment and 2% inflation. So really what we're doing is we are raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral. But we know that there's not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there. So we're going to be looking at financial conditions, our policy affects financial conditions and financial conditions affect the economy. So we're going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions, are they tightening appropriately? And then we're going to be looking at the effects on the economy. And we're going to be making a judgment about whether we've done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability. It's that. So if that path happens to evolve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels. We won't. But again, there's a false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don't really feel. You're going to raise rates and you're going to be inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions. And of course, if higher rates are required, then we won't hesitate to deliver them. Thanks, Tripel. Neil Arwen-Faxios. Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing that areas like workers, wage demands, businesses, willingness to raise prices? Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on inflation? Thanks. We don't really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not, in any way, make us comfortable. I think if you see, look at short-term inflation expectations, they're quite elevated. And you can look at that and say, well, that's because people expect inflation to come down. And in fact, inflation expectations come down fairly sharply. Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable, but have moved up to only to levels where they were in 2014 by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think that's a fair description of the picture. But it's really about the risks. We don't see a wage-price spiral. We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they're doing that. But there have been price shocks. So I just think it takes you back to the basic point, was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal neutral levels, and we need to look around and keep going if we don't see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we're not where we need to be. So again, you don't see those things yet, but I would say there's no basis for feeling comfortable about that. It's a risk that we simply can't run that risk. We can't allow a wage-price spiral to happen, and we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It's just something that we can't allow to happen. And so we'll look at it that way. Great. Thanks, Chair Powell. Gina Smiley with the New York Times. You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China. Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side. And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them. I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those. Well, so.",0.0053395628232938,0.007985697258641294
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:50:00,2022-05-04 18:55:00," So our tools don't really work on supply shocks. Our tools work on demand. And to the extent we can't affect really oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that. So we can't affect those. But there's a job to do on demand. And that you can see that in the labor market where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers. And you can see it in the product markets as well. But I guess I'm just pointing out that a couple of things. For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they're likely to both add to headline inflation. And people are going to be suffering from that. People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks than. But even though they don't actually tell us much about the future path. So what the second thing is that they're both capable of preventing further progress in supply chain, in supply chain healing. And so, or even making supply chains temporarily worse. So they're going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation too. So in a way, there are two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last 60 days, 90 days. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we're different from Politico. I want to follow up on that because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play and inflation. And I'm just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back down to your 2% mandate require that these supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said. Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don't resolve themselves in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be? So, you know, I'll just say for now, we're focused on doing the job we need to do on demand. And there's plenty to be done there. Again, if you look at it, it's essentially almost two to one vacant job vacancies to unemployed people. There's a lot of access to demand. More than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force. So, there's an imbalance there that we have to do our work on. It's a very difficult situation. If you can't, you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn't include the commodity price shocks. And you know, that's one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation. I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored. And I mean, that's part of our job, too. So we'd be watching that carefully. And that puts any central bank in a very difficult situation. Howard Schneider with Reuters and thanks and nice to be back. So two questions, one quick one. You cited the 1.9 to 1 figure. So often now I got to ask you, what would be a good figure there? What would you like to see that come down to to think that you're sort of a non-inflationary vacancy to unemployed rate? And secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels? Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year. How are you mapping that into household consumption? Have they come down enough to you? Needed another leg down and equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate you need them to stop spending? Okay. So in terms of the vacancies on a planet ratio, we don't have a goal in mind. There's no specific number that we're saying we've got to get to that. It's really you've got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance. And that depends not only on the level of those things. But also it depends on how well the matching function in the labor markets are working. Because the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that. And the beverage curve shifts out and that also tends to help. So there was a specific number. I will say we were at I think when we got to one to one in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number. But again, we're not shooting for any particular number. What we'd like to see is progress. Well, we're not really looking at that. That's an intermediate variable. We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation. So there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as, you know, intracensitive spending. And then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly. And you know, there are big models with a lot of different channels that are related to that. And we don't focus on any one market, the equity market.",0.0046945017426559,0.005814367420556728
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 18:55:00,2022-05-04 19:00:00," or the housing market, or we focus on financial conditions broadly, so we wouldn't be targeting any one market as you suggest for going up or down, or taking a view on whether it's at a good level or a bad level. We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions, all the different financial conditions in Texas, for example, which include equity, but they also include debt and other many other things, credit spreads, things like that too. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel here from the Washington Post. To follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of say, a 50 basis point rate hikes or multiple hikes? How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or their rent or their gas bill? Thank you. So, the first thing to say is that we understand, and some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation and many aren't, but it's very unpleasant. It's just something people don't, when they experience it for the first time, you're paying more for the same thing. If you're a normal economic person, then you probably don't have that much extra to spend and it's immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on gasoline, on energy and things like that. So, we understand the pain involved. So, how do you get out of that? It's our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant high nature doesn't get entrenched in the economy. That's what we're here for. One of the main things we're here for, perhaps the most fundamental thing we're here for. And the way we do that is we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, out of the balance, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down. Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates. So, higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates and things like that. So, it's not going to be pleasant either, but in the end, everyone is better off. Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution, are better off with stable prices. And so, we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices. We'll do it as quickly and effectively as we can. We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or really sharp slowdown. But ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done the sooner the better. Thank you, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business Network. So, you've talked in the past about consumer spending and how that's driving drives the economy. Are you concerned with this high level of inflation that the consumer will stop spending pushing us into and what's the level of your concern pushing us into recession? So, the economy is doing fairly well. We expect growth to be solid this year. And we see household spending and business investment as fairly strong, even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So, and the labor market. If you look at the labor market for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for wages are moving up and at rates that haven't been seen in quite a long time. So, it's a very, it's a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job. So, it's a strong economy. And nothing about it suggests that it's close to or vulnerable to a recession. Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity. Certainly, it will not be. Last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic, as I mentioned, growth over 5 percent. But most forecasters have growth this year at a solid pace, above 2 percent. But we've talked with economists who have advised Democrats and Republican presidents, who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable. So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession, without, you know, a severe downturn and without materially high higher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So, I see a strong economy now, I see a very strong labor market, for example. Businesses can't find the people to hire. They can't find them. So, typically in a recession,",-0.0002123693338682,0.0027180335618056657
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 19:00:00,2022-05-04 19:05:00," you would have unemployment. Now you have surplus demand. So there should be room in principle to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work. The issue will come that we don't have precision surgical tools. We have essentially interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance. And they're famously blunt tools. They're not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. It's no one thinks this will be easy. No one thinks it's straightforward. But there's certainly a plausible path to this. And I do think we've got a good chance to do that. And our job is not to rate the chances. It is to try to achieve it. So that's what we're doing. There are a range of opinions, though. And that's only appropriate. Steve, Dorsey. OK. Thanks, Steve, Dorsey, CBS. You mentioned earlier just now fading fiscal policy. Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House ending Congress in combating inflation? You know, it's really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability. And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity we take it as a given. And we don't evaluate it. It's not our job, really. We don't have an oversight function there. And we look at it as our job to what given all the factors that are happening to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability. So if Congress administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I'm not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that. It's really not our role. We need to stand our lane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can give other people advice. Right now, we need to focus on just focus on doing our job. And I'll stick to that. Stick in our lane. Hey, Steve Matthews. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News. A number of your colleagues have said that rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And two, you've recently spoke in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s. And while it's certainly not your desire, and the soft landing is the big hope of everyone, would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary? So I think it's certainly possible that we'll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive, as opposed to just neutral. We can't know that today. That decision's not in front of us today. If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won't hesitate to do it. I'll say again, there is no bright line that you're stepping over. You're really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it. You're looking at financial conditions and how that's affecting the economy and making a judgment. We won't be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one. It's much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we're absolutely prepared to do that. It wouldn't hesitate if that's what is taken. So I am, of course, who isn't an admiral of Paul Volcker? I shouldn't be singled out in this respect. But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. And I would phrase it this way, he had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing. That's what it was. It wasn't a particular thing. It was that he always did. What he thought was the right thing. If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through. So that's the test. It isn't, will we do one particular thing? I would say we do see, though. We see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anybody, really. And so it's really essential, particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very longest expansion cycle in our recorded history. And in the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles. And it was racial wealth and income, not wealth, but income gaps were coming down wage gaps. So it's a really great thing. We'd all love to get back to that place. But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability. So basically, we've been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic. This isn't anything like regular business. This is, we have a pandemic. We have the highest unemployment.",0.0004717849472516,0.0035454287605181053
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 19:05:00,2022-05-04 19:10:00," since the Depression, then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy, then we have inflation, then we have a war in Ukraine which is cutting the commodity patch in half, and now we have these shutdowns in China. So it's been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that's coming out the other side and we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it's obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have numerous supply shocks which are famously difficult to deal with. So I guess that's how we think about it. Hey Chris, good evening. Thank you. Chris Ruegaber and Associated Press. Earlier you just said that if necessary, I think with the words that you would, or if it turned out to be necessary or you said it's possible that we'll need to move policy to restrictive levels, given where inflation is and the hot economy is certainly the hot labor market as you described it, why still the hesitation? I mean, shouldn't it be what else do you need to see in order to determine that? Wouldn't the Fed naturally be looking to go to restrictive level at this point? Thank you. So I said necessary, I meant to say appropriate. We're not going to be erecting a high barrier for this. It's more if we think it's appropriate. You know, the point is we're very long away from neutral now. We're moving there expeditiously and we'll continue to do so. And we don't have to make, we can't make that decision really today. The decision for about how high to go will get, will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral. And I expect we'll get there expeditiously, as I've mentioned. So it's not that we're not, we don't want to make it, making that decision today wouldn't really mean anything. But I'll say again, if we do believe that it's appropriate to go to those levels, we won't hesitate. Great. Mike McGee. Mike McGee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. The balance sheet, why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not start immediately start in the middle of this month's say? And do you have another, a newer or a better estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline? And then finally, I'm just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks. Are you concerned about fed credibility with the American people? So why June 1, it was just pick a date, you know, and that happens to be, that happened to be the date that we picked. It was nothing magic about it. It's not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time. We just picked that. Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month and that's what we're doing. It wouldn't read anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet. We run these models and everyone does in this field and make estimates of what will be the, how do you measure a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing? And these are very uncertain. I really can't be any clearer. There won't be any clearer. People estimate that broadly on the path we're on. And this will be taken probably too seriously, but sort of one quarter percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace. But I would just say with very wide uncertainty, very wide. We don't really know. There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way. And some of you may have read about that. That's kind of a mainstream estimate. We know that it does, that it is part of returning to more normal and more neutral financial conditions. And our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy. In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us really that that's who we work for and that it's inflation that people are feeling all over the country. And it's very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it. I thought it was quite important to do that. And so that was really the thinking behind that. Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem? No. I don't.",0.0017927488028683,0.0030689329556184003
2022-05-04 18:30:00,2022-05-04 19:10:00,2022-05-04 19:15:00," good example of why it would be that. So in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting very appropriately, not to bless any particular day's measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. I mean, it's, monetary policy is working through expectations now to a very large extent. We've only done two rate increases, but if you look at, if you look at financial conditions, the two year is at 280 now in September, I think it was at 20 basis points. And that's all through the economy. People are feeling those higher rates already. And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible. And I think that's, we want to keep it that way. Scott, more sleep in time again. Okay, Brian, what's up? Hi there, Brian Chung with Yahoo Finance. To expand on Steve's question about Paul Volker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well. Higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses and wondering how you kind of square what might be demand destruction. You're already seeing that is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending to decrease consumption to perhaps table business investments. Is that essentially what's happening through this hiking cycle? Thanks. Well, so as I mentioned, you can see places where, where they're demand is substantially an excess of supply and what you're seeing as a result of that is prices going up and unsustainable levels that are not consistent with 2% inflation. And so what our tools do is, as we raise interest rates, demand moderates. And it moves down. Interest rates, businesses will invest a little bit less consumers and will spend a little bit less. That's how it works. But ultimately, getting supply and demand back in balance is what gives us 2% inflation, which is what gives the economy of footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation. So yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that. But the big pain is in not dealing over time, is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Proud. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about, in March, the dot plot, had steady, look like steady, quarter point rate hikes. Get the funds rate up to 2% in a year. Now, it seems like you're much more aggressive. So could you talk about the thinking that's behind that? Thank you. So I think what you've seen is, really, I would say, last fall. In the middle of last fall, there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying. If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports and inflation had actually, month by month inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said no. This is a much stronger economy. And by the way, then with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year. But that hadn't happened yet. Anyway, we got an ECI reading, employment conversation index reading the Friday before the November meeting. Then we got a really strong jobs report. Then we got a really high CPI report. And so I think it became clear to the committee that we needed to adjust and adapt. And we have ever since then, really ever since then, we've been adapting. We, you know, there were, there were the committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a meeting of three rate increases then to a meeting of seven increases at the March meeting. And that process is going on. And it's clearly continuing. And that's why I say, and I actually mentioned this in at the March meeting that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days because we're in a fast evolving situation. And that's what's happened. You can see unanimous vote today, of course. And I told you the guidance that broad support on the committee to have 50 basis point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings. So you're right. And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing. And it's just us adapting to the-",0.002448729721457,0.0028256569652443924

Hi, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I want to ask how you're able to balance your dual mandate, stable prices, and maximum employment, especially when the unemployment rate for black workers is still roughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers. So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that's one thing I would say, and that's important. But the bigger point is this, I do not at this time see the two sides of the mandate as in tension. I don't, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance. You can see that there's a labor shortage. There aren't enough people to fill these job openings. And companies can't hire and wages are moving up at levels that would not over time be consistent with 2% inflation over time. And of course everyone loves to see wages go up and it's a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are to some extent being eaten up by inflation. So what that really means is to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower income part of the distribution, especially them. To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation, and where we can have a long expansion too. That's the good thing as we have. We've had several of the longest expansions in US history have been in the last 40 years, and that's because it's been a time of low inflation. And long expansions are good for people and good for the labor market. So that's the way I think about it. I think our tools work, we have to think in the medium and longer term, and I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability, to support really a sustained period of strong labor market conditions. Thanks very much.",-0.0011391795558374,0.004048201845226952
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:35:00," Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message. We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing. We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy in the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Overall, economic activity edged down in the first quarter as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business-fixed investment appears to be slowing and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we've seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply. As shown in our summary of economic projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2% through 2024. The labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7% at the end of this year to 4.1% in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%, over the 12-month sending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9%. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6%, and the change in the core CPI was 6%. Agregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and long lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total PCE inflation, given developments in food and energy prices. The median projection is 5.2% this year and falls to 2.6% next year and 2.2% in 2024. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that a high inflation imposes a significant hardship, a special",-0.0035219723044904,0.008868107062238019
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:35:00,2022-06-15 18:40:00," on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point, resulting in a 1-1-1-1-half percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the committee that a 1-1-1-1 half percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations. We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks, and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside. Some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably. In response to these developments, the committee decided that a larger increase in the target range was warranted at today's meeting. This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels, and it will help ensure that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. As shown in the SCP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4% at the end of this year. A percentage point in a half higher than projected in March, and 0.9% above the median estimate of its longer run value. The median projection rises further to 3.8% at the end of next year, and declines to 3.4% in 2024, still above the median longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. The pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today's 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting. We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, and we'll continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal, and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Howard Schneider, with Reuters. Two related questions, Chair Powell. Do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July? And would you please give us as detailed a sense you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday? So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions, subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook because we think monetary policy is more effective.",0.0107103649556858,0.01435996356427159
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:40:00,2022-06-15 18:45:00," when market participants understand how policy will evolve when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it's helpful to provide even more clarity than usual, again, subject to uncertainty and the outlook. So, and I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have generally shown that they understand the path we're laying out. Of course, it remains data-dependent. And so, that's what we generally think about guidance and that's why we offer it. And of course, when we offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations. I also said that if the economy performed, if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week. And we thought for a while and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So then the question is, what do you do? Do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is that's not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead and so we did. And that's really how we made the decision. Thank you, Gina. Thanks for taking our questions. Gina's my look with the New York Times. You, I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you're deciding how aggressive you need to be. So obviously 75 today, what did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn't have and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point? Sure. So if you take a step back, what we're looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down. And we'd like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings. That's what we're looking for. And by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flat and out and ideally beginning to decline. We've said that we'd be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attended inflation risks, the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again, surprise to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and projections of this year have moved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point, rate hike as I mentioned. So what was the point of it really is this, we've been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels. And over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we've seen financial conditions tighten inappropriately so. But the federal funds rate even after this move is at 1.6%. So again, the committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels. And we came to the view that we'd like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This was really about the speed with which you would get there. So as I mentioned, we, 75 basis points today, I said the next meeting could, could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would put us at the end of the July meeting in that range, in that more normal range. And that's a desirable place to be because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second. What it really says is that committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restrictive level at the end of this year. And that's six months from now. And so much data and so much can happen. So remember how highly uncertain this is. But so that is generally a range of three to three and a half percent. That's where people are. And that's what they want to see knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to show resolve but also be flexible to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don't need to do that much. So, and if they're not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be very data dependent. And then you're looking at next year in what you're seeing is people see more, a bit more tightening in a range of maybe three and a half to four percent. And that's generally what people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and then getting back down to two percent. So 75 basis points seem like the right thing to do.",0.0112862630812027,0.014014598540145914
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:45:00,2022-06-15 18:50:00," with this meeting and that's what we did. Steve. Steve, Lee Smith, CMBC. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You have not used the phrase in a long time, monetary policy is in a good place, which is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the committee is projecting 3.8% next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now. The future is market of 4% funds right next year. Do you think that's a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a follow-up, could you break that apart from me? How much of that is restrictive? And how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not in your opinion in the funds rate? Thank you. Sure. So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go? And this is, you know, the estimates on the committee are in that range of 3.5 to 4%. And how do you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer run neutral rate. You can compare it to that, and we think that's in the mid-to's. You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions. You can look at asset prices. You can look at the effect you're having on the economy. Rates, asset prices, credit spreads, all of those things go into that. You can also look at the yield curve and ask all along the yield curve where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive. That's not true at the shorthand. At the shorthand of the yield curve in the early years, you don't have real negative rates still. So that really is one data point. It's one part of financial conditions. So I think, I have to look at it this way. We move the policy rate. That affects financial conditions, and that affects the economy. We have, of course, rigorous ways to think about it. But ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they're having the desired effect on the economy? And that desired effect is, we'd like to see, you know, demand moderating. Demand is very hot still in the economy. We'd like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand. And that can happen both from supply and demand. Right now, demand is substantially higher than available supply, though. So we feel that there's a role for us in moderating demand. Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can't affect. And those would be, you know, the commodity price issues that we're having around the world, due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that. And also just all of the supply side things that are still, you know, pushing upward on inflation. So that's really how I think I would think about it. But just 3.8% 4% get it done because they get the jobs done, and they're raising the back of inflation. I think it certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we'll know when we get there, really. I mean, honestly, that would be, you would have positive real rates. I think an inflation coming down by then. I think you'd have positive real rates across the curve. I think that, you know, the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would think it would. But you know what? We're going to find that out empirically. We're not going to be completely modeled driven about this. We're going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open and reacting to incoming data, both on financial conditions and on what's happening in the economy. Thank you. Thanks, Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chappell, you've said that you like your policy to work through expectations. And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period. And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data, the inflation expectations data. But I'm wondering on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had socialized by. So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations, so you've got the public, you've got surveys of the public and of experts and you've also got market based. And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place where short term inflation is going to be high, but comes down sharply over the next few months. That's really where inflation expectations are. And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2%. And so this is really very important to us that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most measures most of the time, that's what you see.",-0.0038246928457287,0.0066824519863192934
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:50:00,2022-06-15 18:55:00," If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted. We take it very seriously. So the preliminary Michigan reading, it's a preliminary reading. It might be revised nonetheless. It was quite eye catching and we noticed that. We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations that the board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time. So we're watching that and we're thinking this is something we need to take seriously. And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned, one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points. Today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We're absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2%. That was one of the reasons, the other was just the CPI reading. So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting? We're going to, I'll just say, we're going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think. So I wouldn't want to put a number on what that might be. The main thing is to get rates up and then pretty soon we'll be in an area where we're, I think, because you get closer to the end of the year, you're in an arrange where you've got restrictive policy, which is appropriate. 40-year highs in inflation. We think that policy is going to need to be restrictive. We don't know how restrictive. So I think that's how we'll take it. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil or I'm from Axios. Thanks for taking our questions. The late breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points. Do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future? And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if labor market starts to roll over? So take your second question first, yes. I mean, I think we're, again, we're going, we're resolved to take this on, but we're going to be flexible in the implementation of it. Sorry, and your question was guidance. So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be, provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. Because it's always a trade off, because you have to live with that guidance. And so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I frankly think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work. With us having really just done a very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we've made it clear what our plans are. So I think that's been a very healthy thing to be happening. So, and I would hope that it's always going to be any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect. And in this particular situation, we're looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. We want to see, inflation can't go down until it flattens out. And that's what we're looking to see. And if we don't see that, then that's the kind of thing that we'll call, even if we don't see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react. But we will soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point, and we'll react appropriately to that too. But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it's always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an unusual situation to get some data late in during blackout, pretty close, very close to our meeting. Very unusual to one that would actually change the outcome. So, I've only seen in my 10 years plus here at the Fed, I've only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times. So I don't think it's something that will come up a great deal. Call me. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Call me Smith with the Financial Times. On the clear and convincing threshold for the inflation to directory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria? And how is the committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace? The second part I didn't get. If what's the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what's forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace? So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation. And we'd like to see inflation headed down. So, bye.",-0.0038398821734786,0.009572592913030139
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:55:00,2022-06-15 19:00:00," But right now, our policy rate is well below neutral. So soon enough, we'll have our policy rate. Let's assume the world works out about like the SEP says, the policy rate will be up where we think it should be. And then the question would be, do you slow down? Does it make you, you know, you'll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down from 50 to 25, let's say, or speed up? So that's the kind of thinking we'll be doing. And we'll be, again, we're looking ultimately, we're not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, you know, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence that inflation is coming down. And that's what I mean by, that's what it would take for us to say, okay, we think this job is done. Because we saw, and frankly, we saw last year, inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turn right around and went back up. So I think we're going to be careful about declaring victory. But again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data. Are you more concerned now that, to bring down inflation, it's going to require more than just some pain at this point? So again, I think that, I do think that they're objective, and this is what's reflected in the SEP. But our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2% while the labor rocket remains strong. I think that what's becoming more clear is that many factors that we don't control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that's possible or not. And there I'm thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain, things like that, where we really can't, the monetary policy stance doesn't affect those things. But having said that, there is a path for us to get there. It's not getting easier. It's getting more challenging because of these external forces. And that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand in, for example, in the labor market. So you have two vague job vacancies, essentially, for every person's seek actively seeking a job. And that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level. People are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation. So that's a possibility. You could say the same thing about some of the product markets, where there's just excess capacity, and where the strong demand has gone into, sorry, where there are capacity constrained. So you effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand comes in, and it's very strong, and it shows up in higher prices, not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can't make the cars because they don't have the semiconductors. So in principle, that could work in reverse. When demand comes down, you could see, and it's not guaranteed, but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we're in on the supply side. So there's a pathway there. It is not going to be easy, and, you know, there, again, it's our objective, but, as I mentioned, it's going to depend on some external factors we don't control. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. So the new projection, so the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024, is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation, and what is lost at the unemployment rate has to go up, and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation. Thank you. So you're right. In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to four point, the median is 4.1%. There, of course, a range of actual forecasts. And I would characterize that if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2%, and the unemployment went up to 4.1%, that's still, you know, historically low level. You know, we hadn't seen rates, unemployment rates below 4% until a couple of years ago for, we'd seen it for, like, one year in the last 50. So the idea that, you know, 3.6% is historically low.",-0.0017423902426147,0.005805322871381607
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 19:00:00,2022-06-15 19:05:00," in the last century. So a 4.1% unemployment rate with inflation and well on its way to 2%. I think that would be a successful outcome. So we're not looking to have a higher unemployment rate, but I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome. I think people lose on their jobs or anything. You know, we're not, again, we don't seek to put people out of work. Of course, we never think too many people are working and fewer people need to have jobs. But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market. And that's a labor market where workers are getting wage increases, maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases as they were before the pandemic, where participation is high, where there's lots of job opportunities, where it's just a really, I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was, that's what we want to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups that historic lows. We'd love to get back to that place. But to get there, it's not going to happen with the levels of inflation we have. So we have to restore that. And it really isn't service in the medium and longer term of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve. Hi, Chair Powell, Matthew Bosa with Bloomberg. So as you just mentioned, the committee is now projecting a half percentage point rise in the unemployment rate and the ACPs over the next couple years. And it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy. You just mentioned that that is still your objective, though. So I'm wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement also whether this means that FOMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down. I'm not trying to reduce, it do's a recession now. Let's be clear about that. We're trying to achieve 2% inflation consisting with a strong labor market. That's what we're trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly it's our goal to bring about 2% inflation while keeping the labor market strong. And that's what the ACP says. And the ACP has inflation getting down to a little above 2% in 2024 with unemployment at 4.1%. So this is a strong labor market. This is a good labor market. And as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy effectively alone can bring about the result of 2% inflation with a strong labor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. It just didn't, the sentence is kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this. And that's not, that just didn't seem appropriate so we took the sentence up. And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence, again, say a month ago or three months ago, that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply side issues get worked out? Thanks. Well, yeah, I think you've seen, again, we've been expecting progress. And we didn't get that. We got sort of the opposite. So I also think the situation really since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you're seeing is the situation getting more difficult. And you look around the world. I mean, lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10%. And it's largely due to commodities prices. But all over the world, you're seeing these effects. And we're seeing them here. Gas prices, all time highs and things like that. That's not something we can do something about. So that is really, and by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations. People, the public expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline inflation is what people experience. They don't know what core is. Why would they have no reason to? So that's expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation. So it's become, the environment has become more difficult, clearly in the last four or five months.",0.00219472209001,0.005608465608465621

Hence our resolution to get rates up and ultimately get them to where we think they need to be in coming months. Thanks, Sherpile. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. I want to ask you, you talked about CPI going to 8.6%. The retail sales surprised the market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down. Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits? We're of course watching very, very carefully for that. Looking at the retail sales, the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. I think the fair summary of what we see is you see continuing shifts in consumption. You see some things getting sales going down. But overall spending is very strong. The consumers really good shape financially. They're spending. There's no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy. People are talking about it a lot. Consumer confidence is very low. That's probably related to gas prices. And also just stock prices to some extent for other people. But that's what we're saying. We're not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it's still at quite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit, but still health growth levels. So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending? Or is there something another indicator that you're watching more closely? It would be hard to much anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending. But we watch everything. We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit. And we watch, we're responsible for watching everything. But consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, 2-thirds of the economy. So naturally we spend a lot of time on that. And again, there's a lot going on. There are a lot of flows back and forth, but ultimately it does appear that the US economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Michael and Keith from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? If that's going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down? So we're responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation means headline inflation. So that's our ultimate goal. We of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it's a much better predictor. And it's much better predictor where inflation is going. And it's also more relevant to our tools. As I mentioned, the parts that don't go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tool. So we look at that. You know, the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations. We can't affect really, I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices. And most of food, not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too. Also other things. So we can't really have much of an effect, but we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations from headline. So it's a very difficult situation to be in. And again, we can't do much about the difference between the elements that make up headline that are not in core. Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP when the members gave their forecasts when were they inserted into the record where they revised after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out. In other words, does the SEP as we have it now reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move? The SEP is of one piece. It reflects all of the economic readings. It also reflects the 75 basis point increase. This is important. So people had that in hand when their SEPs were submitted. So it's not in addition to what's in the SEP. The SEP, everyone's SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what's going forward. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guita from Politico. I wanted to ask about how you're measuring progress, especially since you've now started",0.0016092863738293,0.004043340380549761
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 19:10:00,2022-06-15 19:15:00," more. You've talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports. And I guess I'm curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it's a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that as you've talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects. And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you, inflation data will tell you when you've gone to where you need to go or do you just feel like maybe it's better to overshoot than to undershoot? So I think the role that we can play, maybe the way to get us to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? So, and we'll be able to see the areas that we can affect are those that are associated with excess demand. And we'll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time. So, and that would tell us what's, that would tell us about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we're seeing, but going forward they would be very important, particularly in the service sector. So, sorry, I'm not sure I'm getting to your question. My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when you're getting to where you need to go or might it lead you to go too far? There's always a risk of going too far or going that far enough. And it's going to be a very difficult judgment to make or maybe not, maybe it'll be really clear. But we're quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which it's not an option. We have to restore price stability. We really do. Because everything, it's the bedrock of the economy. If you don't have price stability, the economy is really not going to work the way it's supposed to. It won't work for people. Their wages will be being eaten up. So, we want to get the job done. This is this inflation happened relatively recently. We don't think that it's affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We don't think that we're seeing a wage price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2%. That's critical. It's absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. That's how we're thinking about it. Brian Chung with Yahoo Finance. I just want to expand on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done. When you talk about consumer sentiment being down, household inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk. Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your explanation of the economy given that the description of inflation, the statement, didn't change between May and June. Thanks. So, clearly, people don't like inflation a lot. Many people are experiencing it really for the first time. We haven't had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years. It's really something people don't like in their experiencing that. That's showing up in their surveys and in all kinds of ways. We understand that. We understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation. We're determined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So, that's really what we're saying. I'm not clearly, it's an incredibly unpopular thing and it's very painful for people. So, I guess what I'm saying is the question, really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and we'll use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that. Chris. Thank you. Chris Regaber and Associated Press. You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns. But aside from rises in commodity prices, such as gas prices, we're also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing, such as the Cleveland Feds median and trimmed means CPIs. How persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation and where do you see those going in the near future? As I mentioned, I think in my opening statement, inflation has started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic related areas and it's spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well. It was really an",-0.0024757013038323,0.006589916633584629

Plains are very full and plane tickets are very expensive. Some of that will be passed through of energy prices. But it's so you're experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is high. So it's a question. And you see the Cleveland measure going up. And many other measures are going up. So it's a time when we're not seeing progress. And we want to see progress. And that's really another part of why we did what we did today. And why the SEP looks like it does. Is that we see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be in the thinking of the committee somewhere in the range of 3 to 3.5% by year end. And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that's responsive to your question. Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall, Gensers with Marketplace. Do you still think a soft dish landing is possible? And how would you define that at this point, considering the revised projections for unemployment GDP inflation? So I think what's in the SEP would certainly qualify would certainly meet that test. If you see, you're looking at getting that back down to almost a 2% inflation by 2024. And the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1%. That would call that as meeting that test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there's I think there's I don't want to be the handicap or here. That is our objective. I do think it's possible. Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges. And again, the answer to the question, can we still do it? There's a much bigger chance now that it'll depend on factors that we don't control, which is fluctuations in spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don't know. But we're focused on very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2%, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public. And also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market, like the one we had before the pandemic. Great. Thank you, Greg Robb, from Market Watch. Chip, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more. Economists are worried that you're kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer. And now there's even more risk of a recession than a 50, 50 path of rates. So could you talk a little bit more about that? And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them? Sure. So as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months. And that's a good thing, we think. But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6%. So it's hard to see how that is too high of a rate. And even if we did another, so we're going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the twos probably. Still, that's still a low rate. So that's not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on. And by then, we'll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned a couple times, the committee's views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which would be in the 3, 3 1 1 1 2% range by the end of this year. But that's conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it'll be reflected in our policy as you see today. We'll be watching if things go in a direction we don't expect, and we're going to adapt. And I would say this is a highly uncertain environment, extraordinarily uncertain environment. So again, we'll be determined and resolved, but flexible. Hey, Evan. Evan Reiser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell. I was wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so given the inflation. And will that be shared with the public? And then secondly, given the ill-equated and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse? That's right. What was your question on QT? Just given the ill-equity and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, whether QT will make things worse. So.",0.0008977371742401,0.0035725627183233375
2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 19:20:00,2022-06-15 19:25:00," Of course, we've been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent. It's hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night. But you have to understand the context. Really the context is this for decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics. Let's call it that globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. And that's how all the models work. Decades and decades of data. They look at that. It's a very flat Phillips curve work and the supply shocks tend to be transient. We have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks if you think about it. The pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by a shutdowns in China. You were in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here. So we're aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy. We have been obviously for quite a while that this is a different, these forces are different. Inflations behaving differently. And in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand, but you couldn't get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that. So that's how we're looking at it. And we've done a lot of work internally on thinking about what all that means. The thing is you don't know whether those forces are, to what extent are they going to be sustained? In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on? The history is you see these ways of supply shocks as you did in the 70s and then they go away. And there's a new normal and things settle down. But honestly, we don't know what that's going to be. In the meantime, we have to find Christability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where clearly inflationary forces are, you're seeing them everywhere. If you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it's absolutely extraordinary. It's not just here. In fact, we're sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have. And partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered. So that's what we're doing. We've done a lot of introspection and work on that. And sorry, on QT, we've communicated really clearly to the markets about what we're going to do there. The markets seem to be okay with it. We're phasing in. Treasury issuances down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it's been. So I have no reason to think markets are forward looking and they've seen this coming. I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems. It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point. Thanks for the last question. We'll get a market. Okay, right. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bank Rate. Wonder what your assessment is about the outlook for the housing market given the years long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates. And all that, of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market, given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago. Thank you. Sure. The rates were very low. A good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could to support the economy went on employment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that. And that was rates are low and now they're coming back up to more normal or above levels. So in the meantime, well rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent, to living in single-family homes in the suburbs famously. And so the demand was just suddenly much higher. And so we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years. So that changes now and rates have moved up.

How much will it affect housing prices? Not really sure. Obviously, we're watching that quite carefully. You would think over time, so there's a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes. And as those come online, whereas the supply of finished homes, the inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low. So it's still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while, even in a world where rates are up. So it's a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I would say if you're a home buyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again, and mortgages or mortgage rates are low again. So this will be a process whereby we ideally, we do our work in a way that we're the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels.

2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. And I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Growth and consumer spending has slowed significantly. In part, reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter. Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. Lover market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. Overall the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid. Declination remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Over the 12-month ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7%. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 9.1%, and the change in the core CPI was 5.9%. Outwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong. Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation. The FES monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 3.4% of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2.25% and we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. The pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and evolving outlook for the economy. Today's increase is the target range, is the second 75 basis point.",-0.0021935906810216,0.003565125041090331

While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicating and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often involves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return inflation to our 2% longer run goal. This process is likely to involve a period of below-trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions. But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. I'm wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the decision not to go for a full percentage point increase. We saw a ramp up after the May CPI report came in hotter than usual and then obviously the June figure did too. Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting? Thank you. Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude and lighter the data in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we've been making. I'd say that we wouldn't hesitate to make an even larger move than we did today if the committee were to conclude that that were appropriate. That was not the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made. You mentioned the June meeting. We had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively if inflation continued to disappoint. And that's why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting as we said we would do. At this meeting we continued at that more aggressive pace as inflation has continued to disappoint in the form of the June CPI reading. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Goldie Smith with the Financial Times. As the committee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline and headline inflation which might come as a result of the drop in commodity prices against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings in particular. Given that potential tension and signs of any kind of activity weakening here, how is the committee's thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need to go? So I guess I start by saying we've been saying we move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral. I think we've done that now. We're at 225 to 2.5 and that's right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question is how are we thinking about the path forward? So one thing that hasn't changed is that our focus is continuing to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down. That will continue to be our overarching focus. We also say that we expect on going rates, rate hikes will be appropriate and that will make decisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? We'll be looking at the incoming data as I mentioned and that will start with economic activity. Are we seeing the slowdown that we, the slowdown in economic activity that we think we need and there's some evidence that we are at this time? Of course, we'll be looking at labor market conditions and we'll be asking whether we see of the alignment between supply and demand getting better again.",0.006948161063311,0.007125890736342026
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:40:00,2022-07-27 18:45:00," getting closer. Of course, we'll be looking closely at inflation. You mentioned headline and core. Our mandate is for headline, of course. It's not for core, but we look at core because core is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward. So we'll be looking at both and we'll be looking at them for those both really for what they're saying about the outlook rather than just simply for what they say. But we'll be asking, do we see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down? So in light of all that data, the question we'll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2% target. And it's also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large and they've come, they've come quickly and it's likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there's probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening in the pipeline. So where are we going with this? I think the best, I think the committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level. And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the June meeting. So I think the median for the end of this year, the median would have been between three and a quarter and three and a half. And then people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So that's even though that's now six weeks old, I guess, the most recent reading. Of course, we'll update that reading at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that's not a decision we're making now. It's one that will make based on the data we see. And we're going to be making decisions meeting by meeting. We think it's, we think it's the time to just go to a meeting by meeting basis and not provide, you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal, Chair Powell, you've said that your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight. Futures market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SCP, but then lower them a few months later next year. Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent? So I'm going to start by pointing out that it's very hard to say with any confidence in normal times. In normal times, what the economies be going to be doing in six or 12 months. And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond to the sponsor. I mean, of course, we do that in the SCP, but nonetheless, you've got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt because there's so much uncertainty. These are not normal times. There's significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is an ordinarily, it's quite high. So again, I would, the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SCP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the committee's done. Since then, inflation has come in higher. Economic activity has come in weaker than expected. But at the same time, I would say that's probably the best estimate of where the committee's thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year, by which I mean somewhere between three and three and a half percent. And that would be the committee's further rate increases in 2023. As I mentioned, we'll update that, of course, at the September meeting. But that's really the best I can do on that. You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated. Has your view of the terminal rate changed since June? So I wouldn't say it was, I think we didn't expect a good reading, but this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don't talk about my own personal estimate of what the terminal rate would be. I do, I will write down that in, it's going to evolve. It's obviously it has evolved over the course. I think for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation is going to be. And by the time the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows, it will be a lot, it's an eight week intermeeting period. So I think we'll see quite a lot of data and we'll make our decision at that meeting based on that data. Gina. Hi, Jarel. Thanks for taking our question, Gina Smiley-Lyke-New York Times. You kind of",0.0037641154328732,0.003789209535759074
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:45:00,2022-07-27 18:50:00," alluded to this earlier, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up. I wonder how you would think about that. So it's hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this. We would look at both and we would be asking ourselves, are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent? That's really the question. And we'll be making, you know, our policy stance will be set at a level ultimately at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent. So you would, you know, it would depend on a lot of things. Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward. Headline inflation tends to be volatile. So in ordinary times, you look through volatile moves and commodities. The problem with the current situation is that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn't distinguish between core and headline inflation and their thinking. So it's something we have to take into consideration in our policy making even though our tools don't really work on some aspects of this, which are the supply side issues. Steve. Steve Leesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. Earlier this week, the president said we are not going to be in a recession. So I have two questions off of that. Do you share the president's confidence and not being in a recession? And second, how would or would not a recession change policy? Is it a bright line, sir? We're contraction of the economy. Would be a turning point in policy, or is there some amount of contraction of the economy? The committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation. So, as I mentioned, we think it's necessary to have growth slow down. And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons. One of which is that you're coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021. You're also seeing tighter monetary policy, and you should see some slowing. We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that the supply side can catch up. We also think that there will be in all likelihood some softening in labor market conditions. And those are things that we expect that, and we think that they're probably necessary if we were to have to get inflation, we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2%, ultimately, get there. The question was whether you see a recession, probably, and how that might or might not change policy. So we're going to be, again, we're going to be focused on getting inflation back down. And we, as I've said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can't have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time. We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between racial and gender differences and that kind of thing, where it historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back to that. But that's not happening. That's not going to happen without restoring price stability. So that's something we see as something that we simply must do. And we think that in the, we don't see it as a trade off with the employment mandate. We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term. How? How are Schneider with Grotters? Particularly in regard to expectations. It's been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the risks of doing too much. Does that remain the bias? So we're trying to do just the right amount. Right. We're not trying to have a recession and we don't think we have to. We think that there's a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market. As I mentioned, along with in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. So that is, that's what we're trying to achieve. And we continue to think that there's a path to that. We know that the path has clearly narrowed really based on events that are outside of our control. And it may narrow further. So, you know, I do think, as I said just now, that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do. There isn't an option to fail to do that.",-0.0010999725006874,0.002102996770397754
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:50:00,2022-07-27 18:55:00," because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time. Without restoring price stability, you won't be able to, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong, a sustained period, very strong labor market condition. So of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this. But as a fellow under that, given the uncertainty and the sort of paradoxical flow of data you've been getting, if you're going to make a mistake, would you rather make the mistake from doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little? Yeah, we're trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way. We do see that there are two-sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much, and imposing more of a downturn on the economy than was necessary. But the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost. If you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of dealing with it later. To the extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives, they start to factor high inflation into their decisions, when that, on a sustained basis, when that starts to really happen, and we don't think that's happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder, and the pain will be that much greater. So I really do think that it's important that we address this now and get it done. Thanks, Chair Powell, Neil Irwin from Axios. To build a little bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the G, if you're reading tomorrow, affect that judgment one way or the other, and has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks? So I do not think the US is currently in a recession. And the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well. And of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular, as I mentioned, it's true that growth is slowing, and for reasons that we understand, really the growth was extraordinarily high last year, five and a half percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There's also more slowing going on now. But if you look at the labor market, you've got growth, I think payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month, that's a remarkably strong level for this state of affairs. The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent, all of the wage measures that we track are running very strong. So this is a very strong labor market, and it's just not consistent with 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year. It doesn't make sense that the economy would be in recession with this kind of thing happening. So I don't think the US economy is in recession right now. GDP is more of a... Ah, haven't seen it, and we'll just have to see what it says. I don't... I mean, I would say generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly. It's just that it's very hard to accumulate US GDP. It's a large economy, and a lot of work and judgment goes into that. But you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a grain of salt. But of course, if something we'll be looking at... Victoria. Hi, Sherpell, Victoria, we did it with Politico. I wanted to ask about the new conflict of interest rules that you all rolled out. Some senators have written asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about fed officials' financial activity. I was wondering if you could speak to that, and whether you intend on toughening those rules in any way. So those are the toughest rules in place, at any comparable institution that I'm aware of. We thought about this carefully, and we put them in place, and we're building the infrastructure so that... So that the enforcement will be tight, that actually you won't be able to make trades unless they're pre-cleared. And the amount of trades you make will be... They'll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting. I think we've really created a very strong and robust set of rules that will support public trust in the institution. And again, we're just now... The system is just now up and running, and I'm proud of what we did. Thank you. Katherine. I'm Heather Powell. Hi. Katherine, a survive of Bloomberg News. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of goes into your thinking for making the decision on how much to raise rates? And just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to, could that possibly be...",0.0021866866866865,0.004007514088916776
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 18:55:00,2022-07-27 19:00:00," 100 basis points and then kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy outside of inflation measures that would lead you to slow your hiking pace? So I'm going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter. So as I mentioned, we're going to be looking at all of those things activity, labor market inflation and we're going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be. And I also mentioned that as this process, now that we're at neutral, as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to slow down. And we haven't made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right? We've been front-end loading these very large rate increases. Now we're getting closer to where we need to be. So that's how we're thinking about it. And in terms of September, we're going to watch the data and the evolving outlook, very carefully, and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do. And I'm not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be. So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase, but that's not a decision that we've made at all. So we are, you know, we're going to be guided by the data. And I think you can still think of the destination as broadly in line with the September, sorry, June SEP, because it's only six weeks old. And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick. I think in this one, I would say it's probably the best guide we have as to where the committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year. So I would point you to that. Press. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rueg-Aber, Associate in Press. I wanted to ask about, right now, there's a sort of growing gap between the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the PCE index, and the one that's followed by the public, the CPI, of course. How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings? Thank you. So it's an interesting situation. Of course, we've long used PCE because we think it's just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives. And I think that view is pretty widely understood. That said, the public really reads about CPI. And the difference, really, is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does. And so that accounts for a lot of the difference. However, over time they tend to come together, we're given the importance in the public eye of CPI. We are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that. But remember, we do target PCE because we think it's a better measure. They will come together eventually. The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time. And if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable. Now it's much larger than that because of the things I mentioned. So we'll be watching both. But again, the one that we think is the best measure always has been PCE, at least since I think we some 20 plus years ago moved to PCE. I'd like to have a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. You said that the destination pretty much remains the same in terms of your end of the year target. But where are you in the journey? We've now seen the federal stimulus programs and you mentioned consumer spending, business investment have slowed. Are they moving at pace you would expect or is demand still greater than supply too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more? And I ask because there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as you mentioned. And a lot of this might hit in 2023. The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023 when the economy might be weak. How do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to? Well, just talking about demand for a second. As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter. Consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think people widely looked at the first quarter numbers and thought they didn't make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy, not true of the second quarter. But at the same time, you have this labor market. So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak in the labor market",-0.001473342489699,0.003681442524417657
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 19:00:00,2022-07-27 19:05:00," strong and the economy has gone right through that and been fine. So that's happened many times. And it used to happen if you remember. In the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative. And the labor market was moving along just fine. And it turned out to just be measurement error. It was called residual seasonality. We don't know the situation. The truth is, we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it moderating? We're not sure. We're going to have to watch the data carefully. There is a great deal of money on people's balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate is very low. The labor market is very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high. So it's the kind of thing where you think that the economy should actually be doing pretty well in the second half of the year. But we'll have to see. We don't know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that is fairly broad. So we'll be watching that. We'll be watching that. As I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and give it inflation a chance to come down. Nicole. Hi, thank you, Chairman. Nicole, the kind CNN business. When does the committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market and how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates? So I think you're already seeing, you've seen in the labor market what you've seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation. Still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you're seeing that. We're seeing some increase in initial claims for an insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We're not sure that that's actually real. There's some evidence that wages, if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear to be moderating. Not so yet from the other wage measures and we'll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess. And that's a very important one because it adjusts for composition. So I'd say you, and also anecdotally, you hear much the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can't find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, let me say, for example, in the latter parts of last year. So there's a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance. If you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it's only the beginning of an adjustment. But I think, also, if you look at, I mean, once you start deciding these things, you can't stop. If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation and household survey can be quite volatile, but has no jobs created in the last three months. So that might be a signal that job creation is actually a little bit slower than we're seeing in the establishment survey. So executive summary, I would say there is some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit. Labor supply, not so much. We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn't moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID and there's evidence that that's the case. But so we're not seeing much in the way of labor supply. Nonetheless, I would say some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment. How much would this be like to accept before you think about pausing? Great question. So I think we're looking at inflation as well. As I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down. We need to be confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate consistent levels. That's not something we can avoid doing that really needs to happen. We do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings of excess demand, really. There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than perhaps lower than expected increases in unemployment. Lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level, the ratio of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience. And that suggests that this time could be different. Edward Lawrence. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. So you said the path may be narrowed to avoiding recession. So how close are we to a recession? And then how to forecast possible recessions from banks and economists? How does that make a soft landing you've talked about more difficult? As I mentioned,",0.0028511766324055,0.0040051065108011865
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 19:05:00,2022-07-27 19:10:00," It doesn't seem that the U.S. economy is in recession right now. And I think you do see weakening some slowdown. Let's put it that way in growth. And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned. But there's also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market still. So overall, you would say that the problem, in all probability, demand is still strong. And the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year. But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable. And we're going to be watching that carefully. Sorry. What was the forecast? How did bank forecasts, possible recessions, economies, does that affect the soft landing? Well, we've said since the beginning, I think, that having a soft landing is what we're aiming for. Of course, that has to be our goal. It is our goal. And we'll keep trying to achieve it. I do think events, at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy. It was going to be quite challenging to do that. It's unusual. It's an unusual event. It's not a typical event given where we are. If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor market actually has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn't translate into a big increase in unemployment, as you would expect in the ordinary course, because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater. But we don't know that. I mean, this is a case of first impression. So anyone who was really sure that it's impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty. And so I would certainly say it's an uncertain thing, nonetheless, it's our goal to achieve it. And we'll keep trying to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jean Young with Market News. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet reduction program. It's been working for a couple months now, and in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it. What are you learning about how it's working and how markets are reacting? And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed in the system still several years away at the current pace? So we think it's working fine. As you know, we tapered up into it, and in September, we'll go to a full strength. And the markets seem to have accepted it. By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this, and we expect that'll be the case. So I would say the plan is broadly on track. It's a little bit slow to get going, and some of these things trades don't settle until for a bit of time. But it'll be picking up steam. So I guess the second question was getting, no, the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while. And it's hard to be precise, but the model would suggest that it could be between two to and a half years that kind of thing. And this is a much faster pace than the last time. It won't cheat much, much bigger than it was. But we look at this carefully, and we thought that this was a sensible pace, and we have no reason to think it's not. Hi. I'm Chen Pral, a branch on Yahoo Finance. Looking at financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10-year coming down, 30-year fixed mortgage rates also going, but sideways when we talk about a hot housing market still, it's wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you continue to raise rates. So a big piece of that is inflation expectations, break-even is coming down, which is a good thing. It's a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in the committee's commitment to getting inflation back down to 2%. So we like to see market-based rings of inflation expectations come down. You know, broader financial conditions have tightened a good bit. The way this works is we set our policy and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy. So we don't control that second step. We're just going to do what we think needs to be done. We're going to get our policy rate to a level where we're confident that inflation will be moving back down to 2% confident. So that's how we're going to take it. And of course, we'll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight, and that they're having the effect that we would hope they're having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede, and ultimately inflation come down. Great. Thank you, Chair Powell.",-0.0001496296665752,0.002010263581765303

I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation when the committee put in place, got forward guidance on tapering asset purchases. I think it was December 2020. There's a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind. He did not his words, but maybe we're kind of late to react to some of that inflation. So could you talk about that decision and have you looked at it in hindsight at all? Thank you. So yeah, we said that we wouldn't lift off until we had basically achieved our dual mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that the first look at the new framework that we'd rolled out. Plenty of people were saying, oh, it's not credible. You'll never get inflation to 2%. Some of our critics now who say inflation is too high, too high were the same ones who were saying you'll never get to 2%. Well, but anyway, that's what happened. So we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn't part of the framework. The December 20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. It was just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don't think that is a materially change the situation. But I have to admit, I don't think I would do that again. I don't think I would do that again. Ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly unexpected way for all of us. And maybe the learning is that leave a little more flexibility than that. But did it matter in the end? I really don't think it did. I'm not sure what have mattered if we'd been raising rates three months earlier. Does anybody think that would have made a big difference? Lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn't matter. I mean, this is a global phenomenon happening now, admittedly different in the United States. But anyway. Let me see. I'm sorry about that. Just a lot of people talk about that time, and they talk about a taper tantrum that I know you haven't talked about it too much, but that you were worried at the time about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a governor. So was that part of that? Where did that fit into all those things? Thank you. So I think we learned there have been multiple taper tantrums. So the famous one in 2013, there's what happened at the December 18 meeting where markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end, and then suddenly react very sharply. So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that. It was just like, that's how we did it. And so we did it that way this time. We were careful to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing. Yeah, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive. They can tighten financial conditions and not the economy off-kilter. And when it happens, you have to, really, in both 13 and 18, really had consequences for the real economy, two, three, four months later. So we were trying to avoid that. That was part of it. Again, I don't think that's the real issue of 2020 and 21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy. That was where the big uncertainty was. And our view was that the supply side issues would get better, that people go back to work, that labor force participation would come back. Everyone would get vaccinated. Schools would open. Kids would be in school. And labor force participation would jump back up. That's what we were pretty very broadly thought to be the case. These supply side issues would get solved reasonably quickly and they just haven't. They still haven't. So that's really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply side issues can be. We haven't seen this before in a long, long time. And so that's really what accounts for the pace at which we moved. And when inflation changed direction really in October, we've moved quickly since then. I think people would agree. But before then, inflation was coming down months by months. And we kind of thought we had the story, probably had the story right. But then I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said, no, this is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we've been thinking. And again, we pivoted. And here we are. Nancy Marshall Gensur with Marketplace. Chipotle, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession. So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the US in a recession? And just remind us, what is your definition?",-0.0004240141670616,0.0016476520957635994
2022-07-27 18:30:00,2022-07-27 19:15:00,2022-07-27 19:20:00," toward the start of a recession. So the Fed doesn't make a judgment on that. We're focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability. We don't say there is now a recession, that kind of thing. So that wouldn't be something we do. We would look at the data tomorrow. And we'll note out we'll look at it very carefully and draw whatever implications we can. As I mentioned though, if you think about what a recession really is, it's a broad base to client across many industries that sustain for more than a couple of months. And there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And it just doesn't, this doesn't seem like that now. What we have right now doesn't seem like that. And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data. But again, that's not a decision that we make. And we won't reach a conclusion one way or another on that. Simon. Thank you very much, Simon. We're going to bitch with the economist. You said that some softening in the labor market is needed. Within the Fed, there are staff economists who've argued that Nyru, the noninflationary rate of unemployment might be as high as 5% to 6% right now, which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6. What's your assessment of Nyru? Is that something that came up in discussion with the committee? So I think broadly, a lot of economists think that the national rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before. And the reason is it's the usual matching issue where batching has become less effective and that kind of thing when you have the turbulent downturn and the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that. So it could be higher. And my own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher. Of course, I would add that we don't know it. We can never know where these star-variable goals are in real time with any confidence. But I would say it must have moved up materially. But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly. And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation. Because to that gap, it's the gap between actual unemployment and the natural rate that really is relevant for the negative slack we have in the economy by the over-tight labor market. So if you wouldn't observe this, it's an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen. And we don't control that. But that's something that logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down in principle, you should see it move back down. Thank you, Chair. Probably Jeff Cox from CMBC.com. Just a question about, hate to keep being in the drum about recession. But most of the polls that we're seeing now from the public, people believe that we're already in a recession or heading for one, economists pretty much the same thing. They're being told by folks like you and the administration that we're not in a recession or we're not heading for a recession. Frankly, coming from the same people who have told them that inflation was transitory, telling them now that we're not heading for a recession. So what would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a potential downturn in the economy? No, all I've really said is I don't think it's likely that the U.S. economy is in a recession now. And I've explained why that is the case. It's because you do see a very strong labor market. And I think the public will see that as well. Going forward, what we've seen is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned. We've seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings. So, and I mentioned that I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing by which I mean landing that doesn't require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment. We're trying to achieve that. I have said on many occasions that we understand that's going to be quite challenging and that it's gotten more challenging over recent months. Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell.

How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we've seen thus far might increase risks to financial stability, not just domestically but globally? I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly, for example, 1994, 1980, even or so. So we've been known to do that when it's the appropriate thing to do. And this year it clearly is. I would say that given how quickly we've moved, I'm gratified that, well, that basically markets have been working. They've been orderly. There's been some volatility, but that's only to be expected. For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some sense lowers vulnerabilities. It's when they're really high that you would worry that they're vulnerable to a fall. Actually, many asset values have come down. I think you've got a well-capitalized banking system. I think you have households are generally in about a strong financial shape as they've been in a very long time, or perhaps ever, given what the money that's on people's balance sheets. So you have a pretty, from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture. Now, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don't rise to the level of financial stability concerns. By financial stability, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system. So big, serious things. That's not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum are suffering because they are. They're suffering from high inflation. They're going to the grocery store and finding that in many cases their paycheck doesn't cover the food. They're accustomed to buying. We're seeing actual real declines in food consumption. It's very concerning. It's very unfortunate, and that's why we're really committed to bringing down inflation. One of the reasons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mark Cameron, with Bank Rate. I can remember when you held your first news conference, and you vowed to be a very plain spoken chairman, and we're thinking today about the impacts of fed policy on individuals as well. What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what fed policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape? Thank you. So I guess the first thing I would say to every household is that we know that inflation is too high. We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities such as food and gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that. We do understand that those people suffer the most. Middle class and better off, people have some resources where they can absorb these things, but many people don't have those resources. So it is our job. It is our institutional role. We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of providing price stability to the American people. And we're going to use our tools to do that. As I mentioned, there will be some in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. We need growth to slow to below potential growth. We don't want to – we don't want this to be bigger than it needs to be, but ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that makes the whole economy work. It's what can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren't being eaten up by high inflation. If you talk to people – again, people who are making wages, relatively low wages, they're the ones who are suffering the most from inflation. So it's all the more reason why we need to move on this.

2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. This stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production. Growth and consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports. As shown in our summary of economic projections, since June, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth standing at just 0.2% this year and 1.2% next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. Despite the slow down in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low. Job vacancies near historical highs and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employee employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months. The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August, but has little changed since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4% at the end of next year, a half percentage point higher than in the June projections. Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer run normal level. Inflation remains well above our 2% longer run goal. Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.6%. In August, the 12 month consumer price index was 8.3%, and the core CPI was 6.3%. Price pressures remained evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4% this year and falls to 2.8% next year, 2.3% in 2024, and 2% in 2025. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Despite elevated inflation, longer termed inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current amount of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.",0.0076086956521738,0.011475538982694794
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:35:00,2022-09-21 18:40:00," The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 3.25% of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 3.25%. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. The pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our accumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 4.4% at the end of this year. One percentage point higher than projected in June. The median projection rises to 4.6% at the end of next year and declines 2.9% by the end of 2025. Still above, the median estimate of its longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. And there will likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Gina Smiley from the New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop. So I will answer your question directly but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2% and we will keep at it until the job is done. So the way we're thinking about this is the overarching focus of the committee is getting inflation back down to 2% to accomplish that. We think we'll need to do two things in particular to achieve a period of growth below trend and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market. So on the first, the committee's forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second though, so far there's only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a bit. As you know, quits are off there all time highs. There are some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up. Pay roll gains have moderated but not much. And in light of the high inflation we're seeing, we think we'll need to, in light of what I just said, we think that we'll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level.",-0.001169941775837,0.005581201262290343
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:40:00,2022-09-21 18:45:00," to keep it there for some time. So what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question. So we'll be looking at a few things. First, we'll want to see growth continuing to run below trend. We'll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand. And ultimately, we'll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2%. So that's what we'll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we'd want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2% before we would consider that. See. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Steve Leesman, CNBC. Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rate should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Or can you envision a time when there's a pause to kind of look at what has been brought in the economy from the rate increases? Thank you. Sure. So of course, monetary policy does famously work with long and variable lags. The way I think of it is our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions. Then changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly within a few months. But it's likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I noted in my opening remarks that at some point as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that's how we think about that. Your second question, sorry, was. Is there a point in time that you could see pausing? Is it linear that you keep raising rates or is there, oh, sorry. I should know better than to not talk with my microphone. I should know better than to answer your second question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy, the rate increase, time to catch up in the real economy. Thank you. So I think it's very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2% where we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SCP numbers is people's views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those will evolve over time. And I think we'll just have to see how that goes. There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we're confident in and stay there for a time. But we're not at that level. Clearly today, we've just moved, I think, probably into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive. And certainly, in my view, in the view of the committee, there's a ways to go. You're right, Bill. All right, sure, Paul. Rachel Siegel from Washington Post, thank you for taking our questions. The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% next year. And historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it. Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing? And is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down? Right, so you're right. And in the SEP, there's what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So really, that is what we generally expect. Because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways. And I'll mention a couple of those. First, and you know these. But first, job openings are incredibly high, relative to the number of people looking for work. It's plausible. I'll say that job openings could come down significantly, and they need to, without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that's one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored. And as I've said, there's no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the third thing I would point to that's different this time.",0.0096811971372804,0.01238204473176581
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:45:00,2022-09-21 18:50:00," is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we've had beginning with the pandemic and really with the reopening of the economy and more recently amplified and added to by Russia's invasion of Ukraine have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation. So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles. And in principle, if those things start to get better, and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that, it's not much more than that, but it's good to see that. For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now, supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events, it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline, a rather increase in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging. And we don't know. No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be. That's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also do we get more labor supply, which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless, we're committed to getting inflation back down to 2%, because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on. Just a couple of other ones, I think our vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes. Vacancies are still almost two to one ratio to unemployed people. That's a, that in quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, which, where generally the unemployment rate itself is a single best indicator. We think those things have for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is. Nick? Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal. You said not too long ago in describing the policy destination, there's still a way to go. But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you're thinking about your destination, whether it's a stopping point or a pausing point. And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about as the data come in, where that destination is, how it's moving up if inflation doesn't perform as you expect. Do you want to have a policy rate? It's above the underlying inflation rate, for example. And do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now? Well, so again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive. And by that, I mean is, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. That's what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also know that there are long and variable acts, particularly as they relate to inflation. So it's a challenging assessment. So what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions. As you know, you look at where rates are real and nominal in some cases. You look at credit spreads. You look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think, and you see this in the, is this something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings? And you see this, I think, in the committee forecast. You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve. And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that were writing down and think about, measure those against some sort of forward looking assessment of inflation expectations. I think you would see at that time, you'd see positive real rates across the yield curve. And that is also an important consideration. I have a question. Howard. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for the opportunity. I just want to be clear on this. You say it's meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we're going 75, 50, 25. Is 75 next month the baseline? So we make one decision for meeting. And the meeting decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75. You're right that the median for the year end.",-0.0039822666701033,0.01219385367375591
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:50:00,2022-09-21 18:55:00," that suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases. But there's also, there's another fairly large group that saw 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be 25 basis points less. So we're going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn't make that decision today. We didn't vote on that. I would say that we're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly. And that's what we're thinking about. So just as a follow up to that, I'm wondering about this sort of risk management considerations you're given. There's some discussion now of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is? So what we've seen is inflation has. Our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down largely because of supply side healing. By now, we would have thought that we've who have seen some of that. We haven't. We have seen some supply side healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a three, six, and 12 month trailing annualized basis, you'll see that inflation is at 4.8%, 4.5%, and 4.8%. So that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can keep doing these. And we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to. And we're still discovering what that level is. But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be. So that's how we're thinking about it. It's going to call me. Thank you. COVID is moving to the financial times. Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025? And yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024. And does that mean there's a level of inflation above the 2% target that the Fed is willing to tolerate? So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025 and the median. And headline is at 2.0. So that's pretty close. I mean, we write down our forecasts and we figure out what the median is and we publish it. So I would say that if actually if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome. But you're right, it is a 10 higher than 2%. Just as a quick follow up, I mean, if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched perhaps each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increased today? And does that risk having to do more later on? Yeah, so as we said, at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in. So if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August. So I think you can't really never want to over-react too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together, and as I just mentioned, if you really, really look at this year's inflation, 3, 6, and 12 month railing, you see inflation is running too high. It's running 4.5% or above. You don't need to know much more than that. If that's the one thing you know, you know that this committee is committed to getting to a, you know, meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. So that's how we think about it. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet. You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed securities, but we've seen significant slowing in the housing market mortgage rates have gone up significantly. And I'm just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for how quickly you have the runoff on the NBS side? So what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well underway, I would say it's not something we're considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term. It's just something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it has not come and is not close. Well, and what conditions in the housing market affect that decision? I think a number of things might affect that decision, but the main thing is we're not considering that decision and I don't expect that we will anytime soon.",0.0032087775592588,0.007035488979464627
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:55:00,2022-09-21 19:00:00," Thank you. Neil. Thanks. Neil, Erwin, and Thaxios. A number of commentators have come to the view, including over the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a global recession that's worse than is necessary to bring inflation down. How do you see that risk? How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers? And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level? So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world. We are in pretty regular contact and we exchange, of course, we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives, in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. But we regularly discuss what we're seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers and it's a very ongoing constant kind of a process. So we are very aware of what's going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us and vice versa. The forecast that we put together, our staff puts together and that we put together on our own, always take all of that, try to take all of that into account. I mean, I can't say that we do it perfectly, but it's not as if we don't think about the policy decisions, monetary policy and otherwise, the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy. That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy as best we can. It won't be perfect. So I don't see it hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates. If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times. But really, we're all in very different situations. But I will tell you that our contact is more or less ongoing and it's not coordination, but there's a lot of information sharing and we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies and cognizant that are important to the United States are doing. I'm going to talk to you about the major sector that is in the U.S. economy. We've also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits. And I'm wondering what your story is on the resilience of the economy. After all, you and your colleagues said, well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future. And indeed, treasury rates moved out. So we should have had a lot of tightening taking effect. Why is the economy in your view so resilient and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate? You're right, of course. The labor market in particular has been very strong. But there are the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate-sensitive or certainly showing the effects of our tightening. And of course, the obvious example is housing where you see declining activity and all different kinds and how price increases moving down. So we're having an effect on interest-sensitive spending. I think through exchange rates, we're having an effect on exports and imports. I think so all of that's happening. But you're right. And we've said this. This is a strong robust economy. People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn't spend and where they were getting government transfers. They're still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum, but still some savings out there to support growth. The states are very flush with cash. So there's good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year. We think of trend as being about 1.8% in that range. We're forecasting growth well below that and most forecasters are. But you're right. There's certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that. And that's a good thing because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn. But of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2%. We can't fail to do that. If we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.",-0.0005416419488792,0.004296177437304343
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 19:00:00,2022-09-21 19:05:00," So for now that has to be our overarching focus. And you see that I think in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we'll be moving to, reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP. So that's how we think about it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In a world of euphemisms that we live in here with below trend growth and modest increase in unemployment, I'm wondering if I could ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people. Do the odds now favor given where you are and where you're going with interest rates favor a recession? 4.4% unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs, is that acceptable job loss? And then given that the data you look at is backward looking and the lags in your policy are forward looking and you don't know what they are, how will you know or will you know if you've gone too far? So I don't know what the odds are. I think that there's a very high likelihood that we'll have a period of what I've mentioned is below trend growth by which I mean a much lower growth. And we're seeing that now. So the median forecast I think this year for among my colleagues and me was 0.2% growth. So that's very slow growth. And then below trend next year I think the median was 1.2 also well below. So that's a slower, that's a very slow level of growth and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think that's, so that is something that we think we need to have and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. You know, we're never going to say that there are too many people working but the real point is this, inflation, what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation. And if we want to set ourselves up really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't. So what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we're putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. And that's what we're doing. And we don't certainly don't hope. We certainly haven't given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task. But how will you know or will you know if you've gone too far? Hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean, our, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be. And as I said, you can look at the, look at this SEP as today's estimate of where we think those rates would be, of course, they will evolve over time. Chris, we're neighbor. Thanks, Chris. We're neighbor at the SEP. I wanted to follow up with what you just mentioned about the labor market. You've said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability. And you've suggested maybe there isn't a trade off in the long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern as people have been expressing here about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes. So can you explain though what about high inflation now, or threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to suggest that inflation, high inflation will eventually be to a weaker job market. So can you spell that out a little more for the general public and how that will work? So for starters, people are seeing their wage increases. Their wage increases are eaten up by inflation. So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they've been going up, you're in trouble right away. You don't have a cushion. And this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that's what we're hearing from people is very much that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation? And as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn't. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment. And the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy. And we see some softening in labor market conditions and we see a big contribution from supply side improvements and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed. In any case, our job is to deliver price stability. And I think you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time. We really saw that for...",-0.0020691078939898,0.004972289843062143
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 19:05:00,2022-09-21 19:10:00," a long time, the United States had 2% inflation, didn't move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve. And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is you're just postponing. The record shows that if you postpone that, that delay is only likely to lead to more pain. So I think we're moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that's what you see us doing. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. I had a little orange for Fox Business. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain? How long? It really depends on how long it takes for wages and more than that price is to come down for inflation to come down. And what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that. And I think once you're on that path, that's a good thing. And things will start to feel better to people. They'll feel lower inflation, they'll feel that the economy is improving. And also if our projections are close to right, you'll see that the costs in unemployment are, they're meaningful and they're certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But at the same time, we'd be setting the economy up for another long period. This era has been noted for very long expansions. We've had three of the four longest in measure history since we got inflation under control. And that's not an accident. So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11, 10 year, anyway, expansions. And you can see what we saw in 2018, 19, and 20, which was very low unemployment. The biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we've seen in, since we started keeping track of that. So we want to get back to that. But to get there, we're going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment. And that's going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time. As a foe, what is that economic pain in your mind? Is it job losses? Is it of higher interest rates on credit cards? What is that economic pain? So it's all of those things. Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve. But they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again. And doing it at a time when actually now people have really come to expect, you know, in high inflation. If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people's economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability, the cost of getting back to price stability just rises. And so we want to avoid that. We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it's done. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business. Getting home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008. Yet, mortgage demand increased this week and housing prices are still elevated. Now, at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the housing market. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say reset and what you think it will take to actually get there. So when I say reset, I'm not looking at a particular specific, you know, a set of data or anything. What I'm really saying is that we've had a time of a red hot housing market all over the country where, you know, famously houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask before we even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the deceleration and housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals. And you know, that's a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level, at a reasonable pace, and that people can afford houses again. And I think we, so we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction to get back to that place. There's also, there are also longer run issues though with the housing market. As you know, where, you know, it's...",-0.0025601903333419,0.005083778596254551
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 19:10:00,2022-09-21 19:12:42," difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that. So builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance. I want to know, I think Shelter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw. Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months? Or do you think that there's still this imbalance that needs to be addressed? I think that Shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen. So it may take some time. So I think that I think hope for the best plan for the worst. So I think on Shelter inflation, you just got to assume that it's going to remain pretty high for a while. Okay, we'll go to Jean for the last question. Hi, Jean, young with market news. You've talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory. And you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now. So I'm curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6% expected? Is that expected to be next year? How restrictive? So I think if you look, if we let's assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely, what you're going to do is you're going to adjust that for some forward measure, looking measure of inflation. And that could be, you pick your measure. It could be, there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get. But what you'll get is a positive number. In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term. I think that are going to be assuming that we're doing our jobs appropriately that will be significant. So you'll have a positive federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1% or so. But I mean, I don't know exactly what it would be, but it would be significantly positive when we get to that level. And let me say, we've written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to restore price stability. So this is something that, as you can see, they've moved up and we're going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go. Thank you very much.",-5.184973945515944e-05,0.008732482744195708
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. We have both the tools that we need and the resolve that will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points and we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter, but is unchanged so far this year. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. The housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. Reaction remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12-month ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent. The recent inflation data again have come in higher than expected. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in forming the stance of monetary policy. With today's action, we've raised interest rates by three and three-quarters percentage points this year. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing.",-0.0025440857997319,0.006347479143997068
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:35:00,2022-11-02 18:40:00," It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. That's why we say in our statement that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. At some point, as I've said in the last two press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases, as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go. And incoming data, since our last meeting, suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We will continue to make our decisions, meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We're taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Storing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point. Is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and, let's say, the December meeting? Or is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with independent of that data given the lag defects that you mentioned? So a couple of things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course, that's what we'd all love to see. But I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level? Well, we'll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened. The effects of that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, making into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions. And as we make that assessment. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in December or not. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis, when it agrees? So what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program, if I may, and to talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions. The first of which has been how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate. And the third will be eventually how long to remain at a restrictive level. So on the first question, how fast to tighten policy, it's been very important that we move expeditiously and we have clearly done so. We've moved three and three quarters percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace and that's certainly appropriate, given the persistence and strength and inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time. And we put that into our post-meeting statement because that really does become the important question we think now is how far to go. And I'll talk more about that. We think there's some ground to cover before we meet that test. And that's why we say that.",-0.0066229872580186,0.016770446339804217
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:40:00,2022-11-02 18:45:00," ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. And as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both the strong labor market report, but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain, though, and I would say we're going to find it over time. Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there's a lot of uncertainty. So we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, as well as the lags with the monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions. And that's why I've said it the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again, the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high it erases rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus. If I could follow up on that, to what degree was there an importance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns really around the globe about fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else, you know, dealing with their own stress as a result? Well, I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have. I don't think we've over tightened. I think there's very difficult to make a case that our current level is too tight given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that at this meeting, as the last two meetings, as I've mentioned, I've said that we that there would come a point, and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean. And we did discuss this, and as I mentioned, we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no, I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast. I think it's been good and a successful program that we've gotten this far this fast. Remember though that we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases, and we have some ground left to cover here and cover it we will. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal, Chair Powell, core BCE inflation on a three or six month annualized basis and on a 12 month basis has been running in the high for close to 5%. Is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down? So this is the question of does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate? And I would say there are a range of views on that. That's the classic Taylor principle view, but I would think you'd look more at a forward looking measure of inflation to look at that. But I think the answer is we'll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone though. I think you put some weight on that. You also put some weight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end of the federal funds rate, for example. So households and businesses, if they're very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spread spreads are larger. So borrowing rates are significantly higher. And I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I'd put some weight on it, but I wouldn't say it's something that is the single don. It's a prominent thing to look at. If I could follow up. What is your best assessment or the staff's best assessment right now of the current rate of underlying inflation? I don't have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that. And I mean one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs above that level for sure, substantially above for some time, you'll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that's what the principal models would tend to say. But I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment. There are many different, as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation. Thank you. Tina.",0.0017694509497788,0.009890138566321392
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:45:00,2022-11-02 18:50:00," Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Gina Smiley with New York Times. I wonder, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is or is it risk of becoming entrenched? Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit in the middle part of this year and they've moved now back down. That's one piece of data. Short term inflation expectation that moved up between the last meeting and this meeting. And we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have, we're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation. And we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control, get it down to 2% get it behind us. That's what we really need to do and what we're strongly committed to doing. Rachel. Hi, Terpalle. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post. The statement points to the lag times. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag effects. What that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy. So the way I would think about that is it's a commonly for a long time thought that monetary policy works with long and variable legs and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter and the truth is we don't have a lot of data of inflation of this high in what is now the minor economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react and then that would affect economic activity inflation. Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy. That's the way it is moved for a quarter of a century is in the direction of financial conditions than monetary policy because the markets are thinking what is the central bank going to do. There are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don't know that. I guess the thing I would say is highly uncertain. Highly uncertain. So from risk management standpoint we do need, it would be irresponsible not to ignore them, but you want to consider them but not take them literally. So I think it's a very difficult place to be but I would tend to be, want to be in the middle looking carefully at what's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint. Remembering of course that if we were to overtighten we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we don't tighten enough now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular will be much higher potentially. So from risk management standpoint we want to be sure that we don't make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon. And if I could follow up should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects and they would have been after previous rate heights? So I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate heights and policy becomes more restrictive it will be appropriate now to be thinking more about lag. Of course we think about the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy but we will be thinking about them. But we won't be, I think we'll be considering them but because it's appropriate to do so. Let me say this it is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So when they hear lags they think about a pausing. It's very premature in my view to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways to go. Our policy, we need ongoing rate heights to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive and we don't, of course we don't really know exactly where that is.",-0.003793094489621,0.007048241255092905

Thanks, Chair Powell and Neil Irwin-Vaxios. As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some venture fund attack companies. It's been relatively narrow in terms of labor market, consumer demand, a lot of sectors, you don't see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels through which monetary policy works, changing is it narrower than it used to be? And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you're crimping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road? I don't know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market and the labor market is just very, very strong, very strong. And household, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things. And also with households who have strong spending power built up, so it may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience. It's likely to get inflation down. It may, I think you see from our forecast and others that it will take some time for inflation to come down. It'll take time, we think. So, sorry, was that getting to your question there? Housing, the housing part of it. Yeah, so we look at housing, of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the global financial crisis. They're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been. And you're seeing housing activity decline, you're seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and in some parts of the country declining. I would say housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic, as demand increased in rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up, many, many bitters, no conditions, that kind of thing. So, the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. Housing credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders. So, it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial, doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. But, no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policy is. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor market. You mentioned early on again that job openings are very high compared to available workers. And I'm just curious to what extent you do and don't draw a signal from that. So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to take up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see? Are wages what's really important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation? So, we talk a lot about vacancies and the vacancy to unemployed rate, but it's just one, it's just another data series. It's been, you know, unusually important in this cycle because it's been so out of line, but so has quits, so have wages. So, we look at, you know, a very wide range of data on the labor market. So, you know, I'd start with unemployment, which is typically the single statistic you would look to is at a 50-year low, 3.5%. We're getting really nothing in labor supply now. We had, I think, very small increase this year, which we had really thought, we thought we would get that back most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture. It's true with average hourly earnings, you see. So, I would call it a flattening out at a level that's well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2% inflation, you know, assuming a reasonable productivity. There, with the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment. Let's just say it was high. It didn't show a decline. There's some rays of light inside that, you know, that if you look at private sector workers, that did come down. The compensation did come down. But overall though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds, you know, the sort of the level that would hold the market where it is. So, that's a picture. Do we see, you know, we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning.",-0.00855548020241,0.012930124551403932
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 18:55:00,2022-11-02 19:00:00," of a gradual softening is happening. And maybe that's there, but it's not obvious to me, because wages aren't coming down. They're just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and hourly earnings. We would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are coming down. vacancies are below their all-time high, but not by as much as we thought, because the data series is volatile. We never take any one reading. We always look at two or three. So it's a mixed picture. I don't see the case for real softening just yet, but we look at, I guess I just showed you. We look at a very broad range of data on the labor market. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation? You know, I think wages have an effect on inflation. And inflation has an effect on wages. I think that's always been the case. There's always a going back and forth. The question is, is that really elevated right now? I don't think so. I don't think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up. I don't think that. I also don't think that we see a wage-priced spiral. But again, it's not something you can, once you see it, you're in trouble. So we don't want to see it. We want wages to go up. We just want them to go up at a level that's sustainable and consistent with 2% inflation. And we do think that given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings declining. We think there's room for that. But we won't know that. That'll be discovered empirically. Thank you so much. Kayla Towshey from CNBC. Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession of central banks didn't change course. The new UK Prime Minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And I'm wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the US that would seem to be bucking those trends. So of course, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We're in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts, both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have. And I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers. So we're in touch with all of that. So I guess what it's clear, clearly a time, difficult time in the global economy. We're seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we're seeing China's having issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we're used to seeing. So we're seeing, we see those difficulties. The strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But we take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States, we have a strong economy. And we have an economy where inflation is running at 5%. Core PCE inflation, which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us is the way we see it, is running at 5.1% on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 36 and 9-month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation on the control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy for decades, hopefully. Even though it may be difficult to get it back, getting it back is something that provides value to the people we serve for the long run. If I could just follow up on that. Thank you. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas. And there are some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down? So we don't directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices. But the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong, in many other jurisdictions, the principle problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue. We've got an...",0.0011050595942853,0.0044264109184802836
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 19:00:00,2022-11-02 19:05:00," imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. You're right, though. We don't, you know, the price of oil is set globally, and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep, you know, longer term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even at times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high. Hi, Chair Powell, Janelle Marty with Bloomberg. So the Fed is facing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostick and President Bullard speaking out a closed event. So some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? Sure. So you're right. The public's trust is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset. In any time, one of us, one of the policymakers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a committee discussion of the full committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we've taken a number of steps and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running and actually was through that, that the problems with President Bostick's disclosures were discovered when he filed his new disclosures. That's, you know, we now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people's disclosures and also all of their traits. And he traded anyone who has to make, who's covered, has to be approved, pre-approved. And there's a lag. It has to be pre-approved, 45 days before it happens. So there's no ability to game market. So it's a really good system. It worked here. And we, I think we all said to each other today, yesterday, actually, yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other into this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending? I don't. So, you know, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostick to the Inspector General. Once that happens, I don't discuss it with the Inspector General with anybody. It's just the Inspector General has, he has the ability to do investigations. We don't really have that. So that's what he's doing. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier this year, you touted the three-month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100% explanatory power. And you said, quote, if it's inverted, that means the Fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak. That curve is only two basis points away from inversion now. So I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a leg? Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread. You're right. And that's been our preferred measure. We think it, you know, just empirically, it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is two's, ten's, and things like that. So it's not inverted. And also, you have to look at why things, you know, why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve. So yes, we monitor it. You're right. And that's what I would say. If I could follow up. You also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit? Well, what's happened is time has passed and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not change a word in that statement, though. I think until we get inflation down.",0.0007820979462044,0.004315789473684175
2022-11-02 18:30:00,2022-11-02 19:05:00,2022-11-02 19:10:00," will be hearing that from me. Again, if we over tighten and we don't want to, we want to get this exactly right. But if we over tighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road and you're realizing inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk really is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking. And the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So that isn't going to change. What has changed though, you're right, we're farther along now. And I think as we're farther along, we're now focused on that, what's the place, what's the level we need to get to rates. And I don't know what we'll do when we get there, by the way, it doesn't, we'll have to see. There's been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there. Thanks, Chris. We're getting there. Thank you, Chris Ruegabre and Associated Press. Just to go back to housing for a minute, you mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing. Home sales are down 25% in the past year and so forth. But none of this is really showing up, and as you know, in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's over-techning going on? Or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators? So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying, I guess, that the measure that's in the CPI and the PCE captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And that makes sense, actually, because for that reason, that conceptually, that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners equivalent rent, which comes off of it's a re-weighting of tenant rents. The private measures are, of course, good at picking up at the margin the new leases. And they tell you a couple things. One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it's very pro-cyclical. So rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did. And now they're coming down faster. But what the implication is that there are still, as non-new leases roll over and become an expire, right? There's still in the pipeline. There's still some significant rate increases coming. But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you that what they're telling you is there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we are now. So we're well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. And we've, but I would say that in terms of the right way to think about inflation really is to look at the measure that we do look at. But considering that we also know that at some point, you'll see rents coming down. Great. Just a quick follow. It looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcements so far. Is that something you would want to see? Is that a problem or what, how much that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction? We're not targeting anyone or two particular things. Our message should be, what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go. We have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to that level of interest. We have some ground to cover with interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question really as the important one now going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September, the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher. And that's been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast, if we made a forecast today, the pattern has been that one after another, they go up. And that'll end one at the ends. But there's no sense that inflation is coming down to the end.",0.0051466533623927,0.006580243508412455

Hi Chair Powell Nancy Marshall Gensur from Marketplace I'm wondering has the window for a soft landing narrowed do you still think it's possible? Has the narrowed yes is it still possible yes I think we've always said it was going to be difficult but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to to see the path it's it's narrowed I would say the path is narrowed over the course of the last year really hard to say hard to say you know again I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and to many economists there is a path to there's an ordinary there's a relationship to GP going down and and vacancies declining translating into unemployment or there's Oaken's law so all those things are relationships that are in the data and they're very real there's a little bit different this time though because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and we think on a very steep part of the beverage curve all I would say is that the the the the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures because because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong you again that's going to be something we discover empirically I think no one knows whether there's going to be a recession or not and if so how how bad that recession would be and you know our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time and that's what we're going to do just real quickly why do you feel like the window has narrowed because we haven't seen inflation coming down the implication of inflation not coming down and what we what we would expect by now to have seen is that as the really as a supply side problems have hadn't resolved themselves we would have expected goods inflation to come down by now long since by now and it really hasn't although it's it's it's actually it has come down but it's,-0.0044148686066557,0.004724161461340642

2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 18:35:00," Good afternoon. Before I go into the details of today's meeting, I'd like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. For the course of the year, we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. The storing price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Although real GDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three quarters of this year. In addition, indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.5 percent this year and next well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. The firm C participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year. Conflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent. In November, the 12 month change in the CPI was 7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent. The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to upward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.6 percent this year and falls 3.1 percent next year. 2.5 percent in 2024 and 2.1 percent in 2025. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range.",0.0009651315301047,0.0013116863832103468

But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. And today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point, bringing the target range to 4 and a quarter to 4 and a half percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4 and a quarter percentage points this year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. Over the course of the year, financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions. Financial conditions fluctuate in the short-term in response to many factors, but it is important that over time they reflect a policy restraint that we are putting in place to return inflation to 2%. We are seeing the effects on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings. Of course, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 5.1% at the end of next year, a half percentage point higher than projected in September. The median projection is 4.1% at the end of 2024, and 3.1% at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal, and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. This historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I will look forward to your questions. Steve Leesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You just talked about the importance of market conditions, reflecting the policy restraint you put in place. Since the November meeting, the 10-year has declined by 60 basis points. Mortgage rates have come down. High yield credit spreads have come in. The economy is accelerated and the stock market is up 6%. Is this loosening financial conditions a problem for the Fed and its effort and it's fighting against inflation? And if so, do you need to do something about that and how would you do something about that? Thank you. So as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect",0.0017800192835421,0.0019902834608680775
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 18:40:00,2022-12-14 18:45:00," policy restraint that we're putting in place to bring inflation down to 2%. We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year, but our policy actions work through financial conditions and those in turn affect economic activity, the labor market and inflation. So what we control is our policy moves and the communications that we make. Financial conditions both anticipate and react to our actions. I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves. And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time. I would say it's our judgment today that we're not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate. And I would point you to the SEP, again, for our current assessment of what that peak level will be. As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time. And 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5% or more in the fives. So that's our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be. You will also know that at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we've actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be. And today, the SEP that we're published shows it again that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside. So I can't tell you confidently that we won't move up our estimate of the peak rate. Again, at the next SEP, I don't know what we'll do. It will depend on future data. What we're writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that that peak rate will be based on what we know. Obviously, if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up. And it could move down if inflation data are softer. Gina. Gina's my lucky New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the Fed will be making another 3.25 percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023. I wonder if you would foresee that being in 25 basis point increments, 50 basis point increments, sort of how you see the speed playing out going forward. And then I wonder what you're looking at as you determine when to stop. Yeah. So, so, as I've been saying, as we've gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year, and we saw that the, how strong inflation was now persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed, the pace with which we're moving was the most important thing. I think now that we're coming to the end of this year, we've raised 425 basis points this year, and we're into restrictive territory. It's now not so important how fast we go. It's far more important to think what is the ultimate level. And then at a certain point, the question will become how long do we remain restrictive? That will become the most important question. But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed. So, in that, that applies to February as well. So, I think we'll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial conditions, where we see the economy. And that'll be the key thing. But I mean, for that decision. But ultimately, that question about how high the raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. I've told you today we have an assessment that we're not as restrictive enough stance even with today's move. And we've laid out our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there. At a certain point, though, that we'll get to that point. And then the question will be how long do we stay there? And there, the strong view on the committee is that we'll need to stay there until we're really confident that inflation's coming down in a sustained way. And we think that that will be some time. Now, why do I say that? If you look at the, you can break inflation down into three sort of buckets. The first is goods inflation. And we see now, as we've been expecting really for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better. And ultimately, supply chains get fixed and demand settles down a little bit. And maybe goes back to services a little bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We're now starting to see that in this report and the last one. Then you go to housing services. We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high. And we'll continue to go up actually as rents expire and have to be renewed. They're going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed. But we see that the new leases that are.",-0.0001604027342496,0.0009013681039166521
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 18:45:00,2022-12-14 18:50:00," The rate for new leases is coming down. So once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will come down sometime next year. The third piece, which is something like 55% of the index, PCE core inflation index, is non-housing related core services. And that's really a function of a labor market, largely at the biggest cost by far in that sector. It's labor. And we do see a very, very strong labor market. One where we haven't seen much softening where job growth is very high, where wages are very high, vacancies are quite elevated. And really there's an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. The other, you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now, after not turning it all for a year and a half now, it seems to be turning. But there's an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we'll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that's really why we are writing down those high rates and why we're expecting that they'll have to remain high for a ton. Howard Schneider with Reuters, thanks for taking the question. You described GDP growth in the CEPS as moderate, or modest, I believe. Yet it's really approaching stall speed. Half a percentage point is not much. You described labor market unemployment rate as representing some softening. But it's nearly a full percentage point rise, and that's well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession. Why wouldn't this be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed? Well, I'll tell you what the projection is. I don't think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you've got positive growth. The expectations in the CEP are basically, as you said, which is we've got growth at a modest level, which is to say about a half a percentage point. That's positive growth. It's slow growth. It's well below trend. It's not going to feel like a boom. It's going to feel like very slow growth, right? In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit. Unemployment does go up a bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment. So it's not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision. But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market. If you look, the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is a story on to itself. Generally, companies want to hold on to the workers they have because it's been very, very hard to hire. And you've got all these vacancies out there far in excess of the number employed people. That doesn't sound like a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work. So that we, you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe. None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects. Nick. Thanks, Nick Timmerow, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on Gina's question. The decision to step down the pace of rate increases. Rate rises. Appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the committee's forecast this year. You just now talked about making decisions, meeting by meeting, and being mindful of the legs of policy. Does that mean all things equal? You would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting. So I haven't made a judgment on what size rate hike to make it the last meeting, but, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is having moved so quickly and having now so much restraint that's still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace. And that will allow us to feel our way and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face. So that's the idea. It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me, particularly if you consider how far we've come. But again, I can't tell you today what the actual size of that will be. It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions. Would the CPI report that come out last week, do you think it would change some of those forecasts in today's SEP? No, absolutely not. No, as a, just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects.",-0.0008144930397868,0.0013097091457236086

And participants know that they have the, they know this, that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, well in advance of the press conference so that we're not running around. But that's not the case. It's never the case that the SEPs don't reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting. Thanks, Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. I'm wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate. Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection? Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment rate? Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn't quite as strong as we think it is now? Thanks. No, it's not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market is clearly very strong. It is more just that by now we had expected, we've continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately. And that's why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You see the fact that we've made less progress and expected on inflation. So that's why that goes up. And that's why unemployment goes up because we're having to tighten policy more. And so it didn't go up by much in the media, I don't think, but that's the idea. Is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates, probably held for longer, just to get to where the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2%. Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming or changes to the labor force population, right? It's very hard to say, you can look at history, right? In history would say that in a situation like this, the declines and unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there. But why do we think that is the case? So I'll give you a few reasons. First just is that there's this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount. And we're hearing from many companies that they don't want to lay people off. So that they'll keep people because it's been so hard. I think it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there, where there are 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million, who are in the workforce available to work, then there's demand for workforce. So the fact that there's a strong labor market means that companies will hold onto workers, and it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less. Again, that we're going to find out empirically, but I think that's a reasonably possible outcome. And you do hear many, many labor economists believe that it is. So we'll see you though. Colby. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 and the SEP? Does that not then suggest that the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1, medium estimate penciled in? Well, I think that's why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year, came in stronger this year. Yeah, what you see is our best estimate as of today, really, as of today, for how high we need to raise rates, how much we need to tighten policy to create enough. Restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels. That's all you that that's that is the estimate best estimate we make today. And as I mentioned, we'll make another estimate for the next SEP and we'll, of course, between meetings we do the same thing, but we don't publish it. Victoria. Hi, Victoria. We know with Politico. I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what's going on in the SEP because you all expect rates to go higher, but you're also more pessimistic about what inflation is going to look like next year. And I was just wondering, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, is it is that primarily because of wage growth that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwind? We're going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right? So we're actually moving down to the level that we're moving down to next year. Still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than a 1% change in inflation. But remember that the jump off point at the beginning of the year is higher. So we're moving down still by a very large chunk. I don't think it's having, I don't think the policies having any less effect is just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022. So we're getting down. I believe the median is 3.5%. That would be...",0.0001358578186174,0.0010629882329674845
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 18:55:00,2022-12-14 19:00:00," It's a pretty significant drop in inflation. And, you know, where's it coming from? It's coming from the good sector clearly. By the middle of next year, we should begin to see a lower inflation from the housing services sector. And then, you know, the big question is, how much will you see from the largest, the 55% of the index, which is the non-housing services sector? And, you know, that's where you need to see. We believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have, it's not that we don't want wage increases. We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation. Right now, if you put into can, if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2% inflation. Deal. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Erwin with Axios. Some of your colleagues have been pretty explicit that they can't imagine rate cuts happening in 2023. That's certainly not implied by the SEP. But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back half of next year. What's your view of the likelihood of any kind of rate cuts next year? What circumstances might make that plausible? You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to assure a return of inflation to our 2% goal over time. It's not on rate cuts. And we think that we'll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time, historical experience caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I guess I would say it this way. I wouldn't see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way. So that's the test I would articulate. And you're correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Let me ask you about China. In the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty strongly. I'm wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you're seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally and proves the global outlook for growth and for commodity prices. So you're right. Those two things will offset each other. We could we could output in China. We'll push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately and that could push inflation up in the West. It's very hard to say how much how those two will offset each other. And it doesn't seem likely actually that the overall net effect would be material on us. But to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening. We've seen waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity. China, a very critical manufacturing place for manufacturing and exporting. Their supply chain is very important. And China faces a reopening. They've backed away from their COVID restriction policies that could be very significant increases in COVID. And we'll just have to see it's a risky situation. But again, it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's likely to have material overall effects on us. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruekeber, Associated Press. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to if you could comment a bit more about yesterday's inflation report. I mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings. Are you starting to see, are you confident that you're seeing real progress on getting inflation under control? Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, upward spiral? Thank you. Right. So the data that we've received so far for October and November, we don't have the, some of the, we have some remaining data to get in November. But they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. So the way we think about this is this. This report is very much in line with what we've been expecting and hoping for. And what it does is it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation. As I mentioned, we've been expecting significant forecasting, significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year. And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that. So really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecast rather than at this point, changing our forecast. In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting a good,",-0.0003210748598384,0.0019025029031699695
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 19:00:00,2022-12-14 19:05:00," inflation to come down as supply chain pressures are eased. That's happening now. Housing services, as I mentioned, there is good news in the pipeline as long as housing, new housing leases show declining inflation that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year, so that should help. And the big piece again is Core Services X Housing, which is very important. And we have a ways to go there. You do see some beginning signs there, but ultimately that's the big that more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE Core Index. And it's very fundamentally about the labor market and wages. If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last pay rolls report. You don't really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now there may be composition effects and other effects in that. So we don't put too much weight on any one report. These things can be volatile month to month, but we'll be looking for wages moving down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and ultimately their gains are not being eaten up by inflation. Michael, excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio on television. There's a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just expressed about the economy and the changes that you've made in the set. And I'm wondering if you're reacting to the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions, or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether in the recent disinflation we're seeing is transitory or not. And how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you're projecting just half a percent growth for this year? So if I think I got your question. So one thing is to say is I think our policies in getting into a pretty good place now were restrictive and I think we're getting close to that level of sufficient. We think sufficiently restrictive. We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there. And I mean it boils down to how long do we think this process is going to take. And of course we're welcome. These better inflation reports for the last two months. They're very welcome. But I think we're realistic about the broader project. So that's all that's the point I would make. It's you know we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen with housing services. But the big story will really be the rest of it. And there's not much progress there. And that's going to take some time. I think my view and my colleagues view is that this will take some time. We'll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that you know two good, you know two good monthly reports are you know very welcome. Of course they're very welcome. But we need to be honest with ourselves that there's you know inflation 12 month core inflation is 6% CPI. That's three times our 2% target. Now it's it's good to see progress but let's just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability. What do you think the soft landing is no longer a human? No I wouldn't say that. No I don't say that. I mean I would say this you know to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation you know moves up higher and higher I think that that narrow is the runway. But lower inflation readings if they persist in time could could certainly make it more possible. So I just I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to have a recession or not. And if we do whether it's going to be a deep one or not. It's just it's not knowable. And certainly you know lower inflation reports were they to continue for a period of time would would increase the likelihood of of a so I would put it this way of a return to price stability that involves significantly less. Less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given historical record. Hi, Chairman Powell. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Chong NBC news. You warned Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed likes rates but with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that just wondering where we are in that pain how would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves that would be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs. So the the largest amount of pain the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate.",-0.0090668774859795,0.013036406855999091
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 19:05:00,2022-12-14 19:10:00," the estimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time. The kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn't respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago. So that's really the worst pain, it would be if we failed to act. What we're doing now is, you know, it's raising interest rates for people and so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing. There will be some softening in labor market conditions and I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability there isn't and this is the best we can do. I do think though that and markets are pretty confident. It seems to me that we will get inflation under control and I believe we will. We're certainly highly committed to do that. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Grady Trimble with Fox Business. You've reiterated today and the committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2% inflation target. I wonder is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is? That's just changing our inflation goal is just something we're not thinking about. That's not something we're not going to think about. We have a 2% inflation goal and we'll use our tools to get inflation back to 2%. I think this isn't the time to be thinking about that. There may be a longer run project at some point but that is not where we are at all. We're not considering that. We're not going to consider that under any circumstances. We're going to keep our inflation target at 2%. We're going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2%. Michael. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole, good kinds of business. As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you're paying close attention to a sector or even income level. How do you factor potential exacerbations of inequality into your calculations, especially given the case shapes recovery of 2020? So I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018-1920. What that looked like was wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest. The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history. And that all of that because of a tight labor market. A tight labor market which had inflation running just a tick below 2% in the economy growing right at its potential. So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country if we could get back to that. And so that's what all of us want to do. We want to get back to us to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of time. That's a really good thing for workers in the economy. And we'd love to get back to that. That's what our goal is. You know, in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability. But what we have to think about is the medium and longer term. If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time. I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here. But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity. So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time. And so when it is lost for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible, which is what we're doing. In the short term, are you back to our name? You've been offered a big potential of vaccination in the clock. Are you monitoring? We do. Yes, we absolutely do. We look at, it's our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing. We do. We keep our eye on that. Nancy. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter recession before we see strong, consistent signs that inflation is slowing, in other words, stagnation? So I don't want to get into too many hypotheticals, but it's hard to deal with hypotheticals. So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability. I've made it clear that right now the labor market is very, very strong. You're at near a 50-year low.",-0.0039867863375717,0.006471030850263316
2022-12-14 18:30:00,2022-12-14 19:10:00,2022-12-14 19:15:00," where you're at or above maximum employment, in 50-year low and unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages, nominal wages are very high, so the labor market is very, very strong. Where we're missing is on the inflation side, and we're missing by lot on the inflation side. So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that's what we'll do. I think as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play. But right now, clearly the focus has to be on getting inflation down. Great. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. You spoke a little bit ago. You said that the US looks like we have a structural labor shortage in the economy. Could you expand on that? Talk a little bit more about that. And really are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing like legal immigration, things like that? Thank you. So what I meant by that, the structural labor shortage, is if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working, and then you can take supply of labor by are you in the labor market? Are you looking for a job or have a job? And you're more than 4 million people short. We don't see, despite very high wages in an incredibly tight labor market, we don't see participation moving up, which is contrary to what we thought. So the upshot of all that is the labor market is actually, it's 3 1.5 million people, at least, smaller than it should have been, based on pre-pandemic, just assume population and reasonable growth in aging of the population, our labor force should be 3 1 1 2 1,5 million more than it is. And there are lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements. People dropped out and aren't coming back at a higher rate than expected. Part of it is that we lost 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 And part of it is that migration has been lower. We don't prescribe. It's not our job to prescribe things. But I think if you ask businesses pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren't enough people, we need more people. So I tried to identify that in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do. Because they gave us a job, and we need to do that job. Thanks. Jennifer? Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Sean Burger with Yahoo Finance. You say you expect growth of just half a percent next year. Given that you've said the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful. Have you had discussions within the committee and addressed how long and or how deep of a recession you would be willing to accept? No, I mean what we do is we make our forecasts and we publish them quarterly. And if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean unemployment goes up, but not a great deal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up, a lot of you see inflation coming down. Those are those forecasts. And that's really what they show. We're not, of course, we don't talk about this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession. We just, we make those forecasts. The staff runs, and you will see this if you look at the old teal books, runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those two. And those will explore different things. But that's just, you know, upcycling downcyde scenarios. Of course, that's responsible practice that we've carried on for many decades. But no, we don't, we haven't asked ourselves that question. Good, a G for the last question. Hi, G and Young with Market News. I wanted to ask about the SAP again. If you are reaching peak rates around 5% in the first half of next year and inflation starts to decline materially, that would seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive. Is that something that's built into the projections and into models? Is that something you would want to see? So we do know that, of course, that's something that we know and we'd see. But as I mentioned, we wouldn't, I wouldn't see the committee cutting rates until we're conscious.",0.0022277847309136,0.00544064184530515

I don't see us as having a really clear, precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that would mechanically happen like that. It would really be a test of, for cutting rates, I think in the event, it'll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that inflation's coming down in a sustained way?

2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:35:00," Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Over the past year we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. In addition we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Sending price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 1%. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Under-spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50 year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing the labor market continues to be out of balance. Their demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in December total PCE prices rose 5.0%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.4%. The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And while recent developments are encouraging we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to a returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal front's rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.5 to 4.3 quarters percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal front's rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to...",0.0009639388022443,0.0011865621832744622

We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. People take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step down from last year's rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, as we determine the extent of future increases that we required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Chris. Good game. Chris Rugeber to associate at press. Thank you for doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling which is also brought down mortgage rates. And the stock market posted a solid game in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder and could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in or to offset the easing of financial conditions? It is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy or strength that we are putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2%. And of course financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we are not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course many things affect financial conditions, not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we said policy. Thank you. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter we have seen a deceleration in prices, in wages and a fall in consumer spending. All while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low. Does this at all change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up if at all to see inflation come down to the levels you are looking for? So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage. What you see is really in the good sector, you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services and shortages or have been abated. So you see that in the other, in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down assuming that new leases continue to be lower. So in those two sectors you have got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called non-housing, core non-housing services where we don't see disinflation yet. But I would say that so far what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go change since December? You know, we're going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting and we'll see you at that time. I will say.",-0.0005061915873428,0.0010132964262764277
2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:40:00,2023-02-01 18:45:00," that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting underway and we continue to get strong labor market data. So we'll update those forecasts in March. Neil. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil, everyone with Axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December Jolt's morning job openings actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? So you're right about the data, of course. We did see, we've seen our jar early earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more, but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number in Jolt's has been quite volatile recently. I did see that it moved up back up this morning. I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, nonetheless, you're right. We do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation and quits are still at an elevated level. So by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong. But Colby and the House. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the economic data since the December meeting is the trajectory for the Fed funds rate in the most recent SEP, still the best guidepost for the policy path forward or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now? So you're right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be. And that's obviously back in December. And the median for that was between five and five and a quarter percent. At the March meeting, we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe on going rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to two percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground and financial additions of a certain late tightened. And I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we're writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that at the same time. If the data come in in the other direction, then we'll make data dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course. Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in six or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage. Whereas, of course, we have no incentive and no desire to overtighten. But if we feel like we've gone too far, we can certainly, because the concern and inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that in this situation where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, the job is not fully done. As I mentioned, I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56% of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it. It's not happening yet. Inflation in the core services X housing is still running at 4% on a 6 and 12 month basis. So there's not nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing less than 50%, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible that's coming together. Although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline. So for the third sector, we don't see anything here. So I think it would be premature. We're very premature to declare victory or to...",-0.0004474035278421,0.0010382675763868682
2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:45:00,2023-02-01 18:50:00," to think that we've really got this. We need to see our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector. And they should be coming into play to have inflation, the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But so far, we don't see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do. How are you? Hi, Howard, I'm Robert Throydres, and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation disease. Has these? That's new. You've taken out references to the war in Ukraine as causing prices increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher. Yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come. So I'm wondering why is that the case? And does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook? Or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact? So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it really in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. This is what we thought would happen to the very beginning. And now here it is actually happening. And for the reasons we thought, it's supply change, it's shortages, and it's demand revolving back towards services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's around a quarter of the PCE price index, core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services. And that's driven by very different things. And as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters, expect, measured inflation will continue moving up for several months. But we'll then come down assuming that new leases continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that's sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector. And we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down, this is good. We expect to see that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core services ex housing sector that I talked about. We don't see it yet. It's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same. And we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60% of that research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy. And so the labor market will probably be important. Some of the other ones that's, the labor market's not going to be important. Many other factors will drive it. In any case, we don't see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think we need to see that. It's the majority of the core PC index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is our mandate. So it's not that we're neither optimistic or pessimistic. We're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet. Until we do, I think we see ourselves, we've got to be honest with ourselves, we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent, we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to complete the job. I mean, that's what we're here for. Nick Timmeros, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above target inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? So we've raised rates four and a half percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think because inflation is still running very hot, we're of course taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that. Really, the story we're telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I've just gone through a couple of times. And again, we don't see it affecting the services sector X housing yet. But I mean, I think our assessment is that we're not very far from that level. We don't know that though, we don't know that. So I think we're.",-0.0004448948318049,0.001026770250878372
2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:50:00,2023-02-01 18:55:00," we're living in a world of significant uncertainty. I would look across the rate, the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive, right by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is restrictive. We're trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That's all. And that's why we're slowing down to 25 basis points. We're going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting this week? You'll see the minutes will come out in three weeks and we'll give you a lot of detail. I, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn't want to start to drive and discard all the details there. But that was the sense of the discussion was really talking quite a bit about the path forward. Okay, Tori. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given that we've now hit up against it, I was wondering if the US goes past the X-Date. Will the Fed do whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent? Or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So your question is would we say your question again? Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So you're really asking about, but you're asking about prioritization and effect. Is that what you're, okay? So I feel like I have to say this. There's only one way forward here. And that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be highly risky. And that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I'm just gonna leave it at that. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that that would happen? I'm just gonna leave it at that. This is a matter that's to be resolved between, really, it's really Congress's job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don't involve us. We're not involved in those discussions. So we're the fiscal agent. Gina and this speaker. Gina Smiley from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases and then restarting them? Lori Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to suggest that that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that views broadly shared on the committee. So the committee, obviously, did not see this as a time to pause. We judged that the appropriate thing to do with this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2%. So that's the judgment that we made. You know, we're going to write down new forecasts in March. And we'll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will. Sorry, I should have been clear. I mean, would it be possible to take a meeting off for example and then resume? Could you rather than just doing it every meeting, a move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves? I mean, I think this is not something that the committee is thinking about or exploring any kind of detail. In principle though, you know, we used to do is go every other meeting if you remember 25 basis points. And that was considered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and they left it that they're willing to raise rates after pausing. But this is not something that, this is not something that the federal open market committee is on the point of deciding right now. Steve Leedsman, CNBC, Mr. Chairman. The SEP has the PCE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1%. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1%. And you've achieved this without going to your 5.1% funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year. And you've also achieved it without the 1% is point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I'm wondering if you've considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong. And it's possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high.

And specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Lilb, who said to recent it inputs other than wages may have been responsible for important price increases for some non-housing services, and unwinding of these factors. In other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Thanks. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if you're right, if you take very short term three months, say measures of PCE, core PCE, inflation, they're quite low right now. But that's because that's driven by significantly negative readings from goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory. And that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer run trend of something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4% by the middle of the year, for example. So that's really where the sustainable level is, is more like at 4%. So that would suggest there's work left to do. Let's say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible, as I mentioned. So obviously our policies are data dependent, we would take that into account. In terms of the core non-housing services, as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60% of that sub-sector, of that sector, are we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way. Some of the other sectors are not. And for example, financial services is a big sector that's really not driven by labor markets, wages. So that's why I said, there are a number of things that will affect take restaurants, right? So clearly labor is important for restaurants, but so are food prices. And transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall though, my own view would be that you're not going to have a sustainable return to 2% inflation in that sector, without a better balance in the labor market. And I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften. And so far we've got, as I mentioned in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here, but I still think, I continue to think that there's a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment. And that's because the setting we're in is quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought. And we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think a story will emerge on the non-housing services sector soon enough. But I think there's ongoing disinflation and we don't yet see, we can't see in the labor market. So we'll have to see. And we get there with 5%. Certainly possible. Yeah, absolutely it's possible. You know, it's a question, no one really knows. I think it's because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways. It may well be that it will take more slowing than we expect than I expect to get inflation down to 2%. But I don't, that's not my base case. My base case is that the economy can return to 2% inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that's a possible outcome. I think many, many forecasters would say it's not the most likely outcome, but I would say there's a chance of it. Michael. Michael McEy from Bloomberg TV and Radio, I'd like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet. And with the progress against inflation, there's still a lot of talk about very, very slow growth.",0.0003460293136262,0.002051510208117161
2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 19:00:00,2023-02-01 19:05:00," going forward in 2023 and the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I'm wondering if you have changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward. And whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place which calls for more restraint on your part. So I do think you most forecast and my own assessment would be that growth will continue, positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of GDP growth of 1% last year and also final sales growth which we think is a better indicator of about 1%. I think most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors though that need to be considered. You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit and that will matter for us potentially. The global market remains very, very strong and that's job creation, that's wages as inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also state and local governments are really flush these days with money and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support, they're also spending a lot, there's a lot of spending coming in a construction pipeline both private and public and so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year and that's my base case is that there will be positive growth this year. Rich? Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg, first of all how are you doing? Fine, thanks. Good. Second of all, I think it's early on in this conference you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you think? You mentioned three months, we've seen three months in a row of governor Walder suggested he might want to see six months. Is it just the inflation data or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that substantially more evidence? So I don't think there's a, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating accumulation of evidence. So of course we'll be looking by the time of the March meeting we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will and we'll be asking ourselves what are they telling us and soon after that we'll have another ECI wage report which as you know is a report that we we like because it is just for composition and it's very complete. And you know the one we got I guess it was yesterday was was constructive it's you know it shows wages coming down but still at a high level there's still at a level that's way above where well above where they were before the before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months but as the accumulated evidence comes in it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say though we you know it is our job to restore price stability and achieve two percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. Market participants have a very different job and it's a fine job it's a great job I'm Victor I did that job for for years but in one form or another but you know we have to deliver that and so we are strongly resolved that we will you know complete this task because we think it has benefits that will you know support economic activity and benefit the public for for many many years. Thank you so thank you for taking the questions so you've talked about we had solid job growth I'm ever Lawrence from Fox Business by the way we had solid job growth slight falling in the increase in consumer spending it seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to from a 9.1% CPI inflation to 6.5% CPI inflation is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2. I don't think we know honestly you know the so we of course expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021 and it didn't it didn't come down all through 22 and now it's coming down it's coming down pretty fast so I would say these are this is not a standard business cycle you can look at the last.",-0.0019025499110497,0.006883697813121369

So I think Certainty is just not appropriate here inflation. It's just harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster It may take longer to come down and you know our job is to deliver inflation back to Target and we will do that but I think we we're gonna be cautious about About declaring victory and you know sending signals that That we think that the game is one because it you know it's we've got a long way to go It's just it's the early stages of disinflation and it's most welcome to be able to say that that we are now in disinflation but That's great, but we we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it's gonna take some time That's all do you how long do you see then the federal fund rate remaining at this elevated level? You know so are again my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SCP and I mean there are many different forecasts But generally it's a forecast of slower growth Some softening in labor market conditions and inflation moving down Moving down steadily but not quickly and in that case If if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations it will not be appropriate to to cut rates this year To loosen policy this year of course other people have forecast with with inflation coming down much faster That's a different thing you know if that happens inflation comes down much faster You know then we'll be seeing that and and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy Thank you chair Powell Simon to win a bitch with the economist I may ask a further question about the language around ongoing Increases that of course implies at least two further rate rises If you look at Fed fund the futures pricing the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause are you concerned about that divergence? Or do you think if everything breaks right is that is out of plausible outcome? I'm not I'm not particularly concerned about about the divergence note because it is largely due to the markets expectation that inflation will move down more quickly I think that's that's the the bigger part of that So again as I just mentioned we you know our forecast their different participants have different forecasts But generally those forecasts over for continued subdued growth Some softening the labor market but not a recession not a recession and and we have inflation moving down You know into these somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year will update that in March But that's what we thought in December markets are past that they they show inflation coming down in some cases Much quicker than that so we'll just have to see and we have a different view and a different view to different forecast really and Given our outlook I just I don't see us cutting rates this year if we get our have our outlook turns true as I mentioned just now if we do see inflation coming down much more quickly That'll that'll play into our policy saying of course I Check out the sky horse they're for NPR One of the changes in the statement this this month is that the committee is no longer listing public health as a Data points you'll consider in assessing conditions What should we make of that does the federal reserve no longer see the pandemic as as weighing on the economy? That's the general sense of it look we understand I personally understand well that that COVID is still out there but That it's no longer playing an important role in our economy and you know We kept that statement in there for For quite a while and I think we just we knew we would take it out at some point. There's never a perfect time But we thought that you know people are handling it better in the economy in the society or handling it better now It doesn't really need to be in a you know in the feds Monthly or you know post meeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to you know a health issue Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Gensers with Marketplace Wanted to go back to another thing that fed by share labry nerds had recently She said she doesn't see signs of a wage price Spy roll and I'm wondering if you agree with that I do yeah, I do and I don't see that yet But the whole point is you know if you once you see it You're you have a serious problem that that that means that effectively in people's decision-making inflation has become a really salient issue and once that happens That's which that's what we can't allow to happen and You know so that's why we worry that the longer we're at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long every day You know that the",0.0037625012377463,0.005323890649762367

By the way, I think it's becoming less salient. And people are, you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I've seen some data too that show people are, you know, gradually, they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now. And they're very, very low with 3.5 percent unemployment. And, you know, high wage increases, is nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. So that's what you're looking at most closely is consumer expectations. That's, that's at the very hardest. Consumers in businesses that, you know, are, essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are very, at a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That's a, that's a, sort of a bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be, we think it's important. And in this case, I would say the risk eight months ago or so longer term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are, it seemed to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it's, you know, and that's, I think that's very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided and the public has decided that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent. And it's just a matter of us following through. That's measurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that'll be part of the process of getting it down. And it's a very positive thing. Thank you, Chair Powell, Greg Robb from Marker Watch. In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a, a couple of sentences that struck people as important. When the committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk. And it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I haven't seen, heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, has that concerned eased among members or is that still something you're concerned about? Thank you. I would put it this way. It's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down, but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place. As we've discussed a couple times here, there's a different, tenor in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down. We're just going to have to see. I mean, I'm not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast. But our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we'll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we'll see. It's good to bring in for the last question. Hi, Chair Powell. Brendan Peterson with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening. Given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer faster to that drop dead, debt ceiling deadline. Could it play an effect as we get closer to that drop dead deadline this summer? It's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. I think the answer is basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two because I believe Congress will wind up acting and as it will and must in the end to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk the progress we're making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. We of course will monitor money market conditions carefully as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down and then it will grow back up and we understand there will be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that and we're watching it carefully. We'll just be monitoring it. Thank you very much.",-3.699547422028674e-05,0.0019738465334320538
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:35:00," Good afternoon. Before discussing today's meeting, let me briefly address recent developments in the banking sector. In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at a small number of banks have emerged. History has shown that isolated banking problems, if left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. These actions demonstrate that all depositors' savings and the banking system are safe. With the support of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par. This program, along with our longstanding discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is available. Our banking system is sound and resilient with strong capital and liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our tools as needed to keep it safe and sound. In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons from this episode and to work to prevent episodes from events like this from happening again. Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy. Inflation remains too high and the labor market continues to be very tight. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The US economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year. In contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside. Yet the labor market remains extremely tight. Job gains have picked up in recent months, with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent. The labor force participation rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing. However, with job vacancy still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 4.6 percent at the end of next year. Conflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE, excluding those core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In February, the 12 month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 5.5 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year.",-0.0009251850370074,0.004259157187954073
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:35:00,2023-03-22 18:40:00," and 2.1 percent in 2025. The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 4 and 3 quarters to 5 percent, and we are continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation. We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy affirming may be appropriate. We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment. In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1% at the end of this year, 4.3% at the end of 2024, and 3.1% at the end of 2025. These are little changed from our December projections reflecting off-setting factors. These projections are not a committee decision or plan. If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our meeting decisions, meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How confident is the committee that the recent stress that we've seen and you've alluded to is contained at this point and that deposit flight among mid-size lenders in particular has ceased? Thanks. I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it's resilient. It's got strong capital and liquidity. We took powerful actions with Treasury and the FDIC which demonstrate that all depositors savings are safe and that the banking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week. And the last thing I'll say is that we've undertaken a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation. Just a quick follow up. Given all of the stress and the uncertainty that you've also alluded to in this statement, how seriously was a pause considered for this meeting? So we considered that in the days running up to the meeting and you see the decision that we made which I'll say a couple things about. First it was supported by a very strong consensus and I'll be happy to explain why. But really it is that the...",-0.0004755111745125,0.006743834927025684
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:40:00,2023-03-22 18:45:00, the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and really before the recent events we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes. In fact as of a couple of weeks ago it looked like we'd need to raise rates over the course of the year more than we'd expected at the time of the SEP in December. It's time to December meeting. We are committed to restoring price stability and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so that we'll bring inflation down to 2% over time. It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words. So we also assess as I mentioned that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tight and credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby way on demand on the labor market and on inflation. Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening. In principle as a matter of fact you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that. Of course it's not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever. So our decision was to move ahead with a 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance as I mentioned from ongoing hikes to some additional hikes maybe some policy-firming may be appropriate. So going forward as I mentioned in assessing the need for further hikes will be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and in particular on our assessment of the actual unexpected effects of credit tightening. Mr. Chairman can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming? Does firming imply a rate increase per se or could policy firm without you increasing rates? No I think it's meant to refer to our policy rate. Really I would focus on the words may and some as opposed to ongoing. So we clearly were what we were doing there was taking on board the on trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen. I mean it's possible that this will turn out to have very modest effects. These events will turn out to be very very modest effects on the economy in which case an inflation will continue to be strong in which case the you know the path will look might look different. It's also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and in principle if that that that means that monetary policy may have less work to do we simply don't know. Do you have any concerns at the recent that we're hiking to today could further exacerbate the problem in the banks? No I mean with our monetary policy we're really focused on macroeconomic outcomes in particular we're focused on on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions. I think when we think about the situation in the banks we're focused on our financial stability tools in particular our lending facilities the debt sorry the discount window and also the new facility. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal at Sherpowell in your testimony two weeks ago you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher obviously that was before the stress in the making sector and I realized there's a lot of uncertainty but can you can you explain it all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts? So you know we just come from an FOMC meeting and you know the people who write them minutes will be very carefully counting but I'll tell you what I heard what I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated they would be some some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as as our policies do and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did turn out not to be the case in principle you'd need more rate hikes so some people did reflect that in their in their at from in their SCP forecast I think there may also just have been remember this is 12 days ago you know we're trying to assess something that just is so recent and it's people you know it's very difficult there's so much uncertainty so December was a good place to start and we wound up with we wound up with very similar outcomes for December and it you know in a way the the early the data in the first part the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market so that pointed to higher rates and then this this latter part kind of the,0.0040062096249186,0.005810313306118343
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:45:00,2023-03-22 18:50:00," possibility of credit conditions tightening really offset that effectively. To follow up, have you considered all whether your primary tool, the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector? Have you, for example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the system open market account as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don't accelerate deposit erosion, for example, from banks? We know that we have other tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works and we think many, many banks, our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market and many banks have managed to handle them. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask you along with the FDIC and the Treasury, the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks. I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made. Was it purely a confidence issue or was there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of these banks? The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of contagion to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly. That was the issue. Okay, and then can you also just follow up? Can you speak to the role that you will be playing in the Fed's internal investigation on its supervision and regulation? So Vice Chair Barr is, of course, leading that review and he's responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for supervision. We, I realized right away that there was going to be a need for a review. I mean, the question we were all asking ourselves over that first weekend was how did this happen? And so what we did was early Monday morning we sat down and said let's do this and he was obviously going to lead it in his capacity. So I don't, you know, my role was to announce it and I get briefed on it, but I'm not involved in the work of it. Howard? Chair Powell, Howard, Senator from Rooters. So I want to go back to your February press conference. You mentioned the word disinflation, I believe nine or ten times. The process that you felt was, I forget the word you used, but gratefully underway or something like that. Is disinflation still occurring in the US today? Yes, I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the question 12 times. So it's a, maybe it's a feature or not a bug, but so, but yeah, absolutely the, absolutely the same, the story is intact. So it's really three parts, right? Goods inflation's been coming down now for six months. It's proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it's certainly proceeding. Housing services is really a matter of time passing. We continue to see the new leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation. So that's 44% of the core PCE index where you've got a story that's ongoing, where we didn't have in February and we still don't have now, is a sign of progress in the non-housing services sector. And that is, you know, that's just something that will have to come through, through softening demand and perhaps some softening in labor market conditions. We don't see that yet. And that's, that's of course 56% of the index. So the story is pretty much the same. I will say that the inflation data that we got to your point really pointed to stronger inflation. If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don't see more coming from the credit crunch because it seems to me that's something that you'd actually welcome to a degree and expect. And are you not seeing more coming from that because you don't know or because you just don't want to have another round of wishful thinking? So it's really just a question of not knowing at this point. There's a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring and inflation, very large body of literature. The question is how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustained will it be? That's the issue. And we don't really see it yet. It's so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates and it's, but it's very kind of rule of thumb guesswork almost at this point. But we think it's, it's potentially quite real. And that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward, as we think about for the rate hikes, for us, we'll be paying attention to the actual unexpected effects from that. Gina? Hi, Chair Powell. Gina Smiley from New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit. I know that you've got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what?",0.0018205396777893,0.004692843413793953
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:50:00,2023-03-22 18:55:00," you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward. And I wonder, you know, how can the American people have confidence that there aren't other weaknesses out there in the banking system given that this one got missed as you noted? So let me say what I think happened and then I'll come to the questions around supervision. So at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly. They grew the bank very quickly. They exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Didn't hedge that risk. We now know that supervisors saw these risks and intervened. We know that the public saw all this. We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank room. So this is a very large group of connected depositors, concentrated group of connected depositors and a very, very fast run faster than the historical record would suggest. So as for us, so for our part, we're doing a review of supervision and regulation. My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did this happen? Is the question. What went wrong? Try to find that. We will find that and then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn't happen again and then implement those policies. It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be. I simply can't do that. Vice Chair Bar is leading this and I think he's testifying next week. But that will be up to him. So that's really where it is. The review is going to be thorough and transparent. It is clear to you really to your last question. It's clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation and I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report and I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation. All right. And the final point, can we feel confident that these weaknesses don't exist elsewhere given that they've omitted this bank? These are not weaknesses that are at all broadly through the banking system. This was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk. And again, supervisors did get in there and they were, as you know, obviously, they were on this issue but nonetheless this still happened. So that's really the nature of the interview of the review is to discover that. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television, you've been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time. Following today's decision, the markets have now priced in one more increase in May and then every meeting the rest of this year, they're pricing in rate cuts. Are they getting this totally wrong from the Fed or is there something different about the way you're looking at it given that you're now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing? So we published an SEP today as you will have seen it. It shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand in labor market with inflation moving down gradually. In that most likely case, if that happens, participants don't see rate cuts this year. They just don't. I would just say as always, the path of the economy is uncertain and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we're right down in the SEP. But that's not our baseline expectation. Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1% basically consensus is based on being, it will be sufficiently restrictive or is it leavened by the idea of you don't know what's going to happen? In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal? It's going to depend. Remember, we're looking for purposes of our monetary policy tool. We're looking at what's happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening and credit conditions? And then we're thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do. So in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. So the key is we have to have policies need to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2% over time. It doesn't all have to come from rate hikes. It can come from tighter credit conditions. So we're looking at, and we're, it's highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be. So we're just going to have to watch. In the meantime, obviously at the end of the day, we will...",-0.0032112718129993,0.004822950246145405
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:55:00,2023-03-22 19:00:00," We'll do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent. No one should doubt that. It's going to Rachel Segal. Hi Chair Powell. Rachel Segal from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. I know we've talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy. But there's also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year and next. And that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans. Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of what we saw with SVB to banks that disproportionately are focused on commercial real estate? So we're well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate. I really don't think it's comparable to this. The banking system is strong. It is sound. It is resilient. It's well capitalized. And I really don't see that as at all analogous to this. One other question. Would you be open to an independent investigation separate from the Fed's probe? I welcome. It's 100% certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that. So we welcome. When a bank fails, they're investigations and of course we welcome that. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. The Fed has been rather sticky. So do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster? We don't assume that. We don't give advice to the fiscal authorities. We assume that we take fiscal policy as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model along with a million other things. And we have responsibility for price stability. The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that and nothing is going to change that. And we will get inflation down to 2% in time. And if I can follow on that, but they're working, the spending that's happened is working against what you are doing, right? So it's prolonging inflation? You have to look at the impulse from spending because spending was of course tremendously high during the pandemic. And then as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down. The sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what's driving inflation right now. It was at the beginning, perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that's not really the story now. It's going to Neil Irwin. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Two questions about aspects of the government's response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago. First, why is this new bank funding facility done under emergency 133 authority as opposed to expansion of the discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that's been around a long time? And second, can you discuss the federal and the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there's $143 billion on your balance sheets last week supporting that deposit guarantee? Sure. So 133 seemed like the right. We have a little more flexibility on under section 133. We've done quite a lot under the discount window as well. We need to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 133. Really no magic to that. It's only available in unusual and ex-circumstances and it has to be meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place. So with the FDIC, we're lending to the, in effect, we're lending to the bridge bank. So that's where the funds came from. And it's a loan that's 100% guaranteed by the FDIC, so there's no risk for us. Okay, Chris, where's the paper? Thank you, Chris Regaber and Associated Press. The SEB, SEP suggests one more rate hike as does the change in the language in the statement, and which suggests that you're perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes. Do you feel though that if inflation remains high, you'll be able to resume additional hikes as needed or have you somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end? Thank you. Absolutely not. No, we, if we need to raise rates higher, we will. I think for now though, we, as I've mentioned, we see the likelihood of credit tightening. We know that that can have an effect on the macro economy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we're going to be watching to see what that is, and we'll also be watching it, what's happening with inflation, and in the labor market. So we'll be watching all those things, and of course we will eventually get to tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We'll find ourselves at that place. Hi Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a couple questions about the balance sheet. First of all, I'm curious.",-0.0046202642291651,0.005621925509487022
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 19:00:00,2023-03-22 19:05:00, At what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing the balance sheet. And I'm also curious what your thoughts are on the not just the availability of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system. And at what point you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks. So people think of QE and QT in different ways. So let me be clear about how I'm thinking about these recent developments. So recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer term securities. Large scale purchases of long term securities are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down pushing up the price and down the rates longer term rates which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well. The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet the special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions. It's not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy. We do believe that it's working. It's having its intended effect of bolstering confidence into the banking system and thereby forstalling what might otherwise have been in abrupt and outsized tightening and financial conditions. So that's working. In terms of the distribution of reserves we don't see ourselves as running into reserve shortages. We think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to run off predictably and passively is working. And of course we're always prepared to change that if that changes but we don't see any evidence that that's changed. Hi Chair. A lettering a survival with Bloomberg news. The minutes of the January February meeting the last meeting indicate that you discuss the possibility of runs on non bank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios. Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion kind of what was talked about in light of that. And then why didn't the Fed do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent what happened this month. I mean to be honest I don't recall the specifics of that. It's been quite an interesting seven weeks. But I will tell you though that we have there have been presentations about interest rate risk. I mean it's been in all the newspapers. It's not a surprise that there are institutions that have that have had unhedged long positions in long duration securities that have lost value as as longer term rates have gone up due to our rate increases. So that's that's not a surprise. I think as you know as is as is now on the public record the supervisory team was apparently engaged very much engaged with the bank. Repeatedly and was escalating but you know nonetheless what happened happened. And so that's really the purpose of one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Bar is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change. I mean one one thing is the speed of the come back to that the speed of the run it's it's very different for what we've seen in the past. And it does kind of suggest that there's a need for possible regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision regulation need to keep up with what's happening in the world. Can you confirm whether or not the board knew about these escalations by the exam examiners in San Francisco. I will have to come back to you on that. I don't know. Simon or Brinavitch with the economist thank you very much. Chair Powell you've stated twice today that all depositors savings in the banking system are safe. Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings. Shouldn't Congress have a say in that. And just by way of example if a bank with less than a billion dollars in assets failed are you promising to be allowed all of its depositors. Well I'm not saying anything more than I'm saying so but what I'm saying is you've seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to or to the financial system. And we prepare to use those tools and I think depositors should assume that they're that their deposits are safe. Thank you Chair Powell. Greg Robb from Markerwatch. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. You gave just a little bit of color. You said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend you said the question you guys asked was how did the.,-0.0040395423524689,0.005670362903225807
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 19:05:00,2023-03-22 19:10:00," happened when you saw Silicon Valley Bank. So I was wondering if you could go to the credit Swiss merger. I mean, wasn't that the big gorilla in the room? Aren't you, didn't you breathe a sigh of relief when that merger happened? Thanks. Sure. So, you know, that, that was really this Swiss government. We, of course, were, were following it over the course of the weekend and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect. It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to and it has been the markets have accepted it and it seems to have, seems to have gone well and I think there was a concern that it might not go well. So coming, coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that has gone well. So far. Nicole. Hi, thank you, Chair Powell and Nicole Goodkind with CNN Business. In the summary of economic projections that FOMC sees the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% this year, I'm wondering how you anticipate preventing this from snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal? So that's just, that's an estimate of what will happen as, as demand slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it's just, it's, it's a highly uncertain estimate and I mean, I really, we have to bring inflation down to 2% the costs of bringing it down, there are real costs to bring it down to 2% but the costs of failing are much higher and if you read your history as you, I'm sure you have, you can see that if, if Central Bank doesn't get inflation back in place, get inflation, make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile and it's hard to invest capital, it's hard for an economy to perform well and that's, we're looking to avoid that and you know, to get back to where we need to be back to where we were for a quarter century and get there as quickly as we can. But I guess the question is historically it's hard to, it's the night, please. Yes, sir. Thank you. Historically it's been hard to contain an employment and I, the question is, do you worry about some sort of snowball effect and how do you factor that into your, your projections and your thoughts? It depends on whether you, so recessions tend to be nonlinear and so they're very hard to model, you know, the models all work in a kind of linear way. If you have more of this, you get more of that but when a recession happens, the reactions tend to be nonlinear and that's what it, so we don't know whether that'll happen this time, we don't know if so, we don't know what, how significant it will be and so, you know, we're very focused on getting inflation down and because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve. That's how we can have a long, you know, we've had very strong labor markets through these long expansions that we've had four of the five longest or three of the four longest expansions in US history have been really since the high inflation period and the reason was inflation wasn't forcing the central bank to come in and stop an insipient or, you know, an expansion. You can have very, very long expansions without high inflation and we had several of those and they're very good for people. You see late in expansion, you see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum. It's just a place that we should try to get back to. Jean. Hi, Chair Powell. Jean, I'm with Market News. I just wanted to ask with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibility of a soft landing from the US economy? You know, it's too early to say really whether whether these events have had much of an effect. It's hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility but I guess I would just say it's too early to say whether there really have been changes in that. You know, the question will be how long this period is sustained. The longer it's sustained, then the greater will be the likely declines in or tightening and credit standards, credit availability. So we'll just have to see. I do still think, though, that there's a pathway to that. I think that pathway still exists and, you know, we're certainly trying to find it. Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy, Marshall Genser with Marketplace. Just wondering how many financial institutions have been issued matters requiring retention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point? How many? I don't know. But those are serious. Those are...",-0.0009211388259006,0.004372330477417952
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 19:10:00,2023-03-22 19:13:31," regulatory, particularly immediate attention. That's, I guess, there were six of them. So. And getting to the seriousness of it, how are you going to ensure that banks comply with these citations take them seriously? How we enforce them? That is a great question. And is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair of Barr's leadership. So I think that's what you think about. What can we do to make sure that? But again, that's not for me to answer today. Do you have specific thoughts on that? Well, I see if I did, I wouldn't share them, because I really, this review is going on. And I want nothing other than us to find out what happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes. That's all I want. It's for me to be giving you my half-form to or partially informed thoughts. It just isn't appropriate. There's a real serious review going on with people from all of the Federal Reserve system who are not connected to this work, not connected to this bank. And under, again, Vice Chair of Barr's leadership, and I'm confident that it will produce a satisfactory result. OK. We'll go to Jennifer for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. Carrie, how do you view financial conditions right now? If credit becomes expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you're watching for, would that situation warrant a rate cut? What situation would warrant a rate cut? And have the bank failures prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff? Thank you. So we haven't really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation. That's not something we've discussed yet. As I mentioned, we're always willing to change that if we conclude that it's appropriate, but we're really not seeing any signs there. Sorry. Then the question before that was just give me a. Carrie, how you view financial conditions now, and if credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut? So financial conditions seem to have tightened. And probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because the traditional indexes are focused a lot on rates and equities, and they don't necessarily capture lending conditions. So we think that, though. So there are other measures, which, if they're focused on bank lending conditions and things like that, they show some more tightening. The question for us, though, is how is significant will that be, and how will we the extent of it, and will be the duration of it? And then once you know that, there's a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands, how that works its way into the economy over what period of time. And so we'll be looking to see the first part of that, how serious is this, and does it look like it's going to be sustained? And if it is, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions. I mentioned with rate cuts. It's rate cuts are not in our base case. And so that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you very much.",0.0022444141826801,0.00442008486562942
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:35:00," Good afternoon. Before discussing today's meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode, and we will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision and Bars review of the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The reviews findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I'm confident that we will do so. From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Since early last year, we've raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we'll take a data dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy-forming may be appropriate. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest at 1.1 percent despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the year, job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March at 3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. While wage growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent. Following the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5 and a quarter percent, and we are continuing to the process of significantly reducing our security's holdings. With today's",-0.0019148265748843,0.0025264180736062685
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:35:00,2023-05-03 18:40:00," We have raised interest rates by five percentage points in a little more than a year. We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions. Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook. But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with monetary policy restraint we've put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will make that determination meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep our longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Increasing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thanks, Deena. Hi, Gina Smyla. Can you our times? Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes. If so, what a recession like what they're envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate. So taking your question, of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A decision on a pause was not made today. We will have noticed that in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is not in the statement anymore. We took that out and instead we're saying that in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% over time, the committee will take into account certain factors. That's a meaningful change that we were no longer saying that we anticipate. So we'll be driven by incoming data, meeting by meeting and we'll approach that question at the June meeting. So the staff's forecast is, so let me say start by saying that that's not my own most likely case, which is really that the economy will continue to grow at a modest rate this year. I think that's so different people in the committee have different forecasts. That's my own assessment of the most likely path. Staff produces its own forecast and it's independent of the forecasts of the participants, which include the governors and the reserve bank presidents of course. And we think this is a healthy thing that the staff is writing down what they really think they're not especially influenced by what the governors think and vice versa. The governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it's actually good that the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession and by that I would characterize as one in which the rising unemployment is smaller than has been typical in modern era recessions. I wouldn't want to characterize the staff's forecast for this meeting. We'll leave that to the minutes. But broadly, broadly similar to that.",0.0020641589159522,0.005898123324396822
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:40:00,2023-05-03 18:45:00," Thank you, Chair Powell, for the seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt limit stand off. You said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised. But do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default and what type of situation would that look like? So I wouldn't want to speculate specifically, but I will say this. These are fiscal policy matters for starters, and they're for Congress and the administration for the elected parts of the government to deal with, and they're really consigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this. It's essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they're due. A failure to do that would be unprecedented. We'd be in uncharted territory and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse. So I'll just leave it there. We don't give advice to either side. We just would point out that it's very important that this be done. The other point I'll make about that though is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential short and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. It would be so uncertain that it's just as important that this – we never get to a place where we're actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government's not paying its bills. And just to follow up, was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff? Did that affect today's monetary policy decision at all? I wouldn't say that it did. It was – of course, it's something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the outlook and that will – that come up – a number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn't say that it was important in today's monetary policy decision yet. Steve. Oh, thank you, Yemen. Steve Leigh's been CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you will inform that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks? Can you tell me what supervisory actions you've done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk? And kind of part three, but it's all the same question here. Do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy at supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you. Sure. So, the February 14 presentation, I didn't remember it very well, but now, of course, I've gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole board, the entire board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank which talked about the amount of losses they are marked to market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about that I recall anyway about the risk of a bank run. So it was, I think, the takeaway was they were going a way to do an assessment of vertical, sorry, a horizontal assessment of banks. It wasn't presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as an informational, non-decision kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation. And as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we're doing, of course, I think banks themselves, or many, many banks, are now attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since the events of early March to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. You know, like so many things, it's very useful. But ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They're both working well together. We've used our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And at the same time, we've been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be argumentative, but the staff report said S.V.B. has significant interest rate risk. It said interest rate risk measurements failed at S.V.B. And it said, thanks with large unrealized losses, faced significant safety and sadness risk. Why was that not alarming? Well, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't alarming. It was, they're pointing out something that they're working on and that they're on the case that, you know, that I'm not sure whether they mentioned, I think they did actually. They mentioned that they had taken regulatory...",-0.0013568399369925,0.005710536547433959

I think it was to say yes this is a bank and there are many other banks that are experiencing these things and we're on the case. Thank you. Got a big point. Hi Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you obviously with the recent bank turmoil we've seen multiple banks by other banks and I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the US getting even larger. So we certainly don't and I don't have an agenda to further consolidate banks. There's been consolidation has been a factor in the US banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even it goes back more than 30 years. When I was in the government a while back I think there were 14,000 banks now there are 4,000 in change. So that's going on. I personally have long felt that having small medium and large size banks is a great part of our banking system. The community banks serve particular customers very well. Regional banks serve very important purposes and the various kinds of G-SIMS do as well. So I think it's healthy to have a range of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that's a positive thing. Is it a financial so I would just say in terms of JP Morgan buying first republic the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely that is their role so I really don't have a comment on that process. As you know there's an exception to the deposit cap for failing bank. So it was legitimate and I think the FDIC I believe is bound by law to take the bid that is the least cost bid. So I would assume that's what they did. So do you have any concerns about the fact that they're getting larger in general? So I think it's probably good policy that we don't want the largest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. But this is an exception for a failing bank and I think it's actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also would have been a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks but this company and that could have been the outcome but ultimately we have to follow the law in our agencies and the law as it goes to the least cost bid. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. At the March meeting you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be equal to one or more rate increases. So given development since then how has your estimate changed? Yeah I think I follow that up by saying it's quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But in principle that's the idea. When we've been raising interest rates and that raises the price of credit in a sense restricts credit in the economy working through the price mechanism and when banks raise their credit standards that can also make credit tighten or in a kind of broadly similar way. It isn't possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other although firms are trying that and we're trying it but ultimately we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment. So it does complicate the task of achieving sufficiently restrictive stance but I think conceptually though we think that interest rates in principle we won't have to raise rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don't know how persistent these effects will be we don't know how large it will be and how long they'll take to be transmitted but that's what we'll be watching carefully to find out. Just to quickly follow up what does it suggest about the scope for the committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month even if the data remains strong then if it's having some kind of substitute effect. This is just something that we have to factor in as we want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way. The assessment of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one. Meeting by meeting and we're going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that they're listed in the statement. The obvious factors that's the way we're going to be thinking about it and that's really all we can do. As I said it does complicate we have you know a broad understanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing.",-0.0003761268639513,0.002498846499429312
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:50:00,2023-05-03 18:55:00," There's a lot of literature on that, but translating it into rate Ix is uncertain, let's say it adds even further uncertainty. Nonetheless, we'll be able to see what's happening with credit conditions, what's happening with lending. We get a lot of data on that, and we'll factor that into our decision making. Howard Shire with Reuters, thank you. So noting that the statement dropped the reference to sufficiently restricted, restrictive, I was wondering given your baseline outlook whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5 and a quarter percent is in fact sufficiently restrictive. So that's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to need a data to accumulate on that. Not an assessment that we've made. That would mean we think we've reached that point, and I just think it's not possible to say that with confidence now. But nonetheless, you will know that the summary of economic projections from the March meeting showed that at that point in time that the median participant thought that this was the appropriate level of the ultimate high level of rates. We don't know that. We'll revisit that at the June meeting. And that's, you know, we're just going to have to, before we really declare that, I think we're going to have to see data accumulating and make that, as I mentioned, it's an ongoing assessment. I follow up on credit. Could you give us a sense of what the SLU's survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were tightening credit as of the last survey. What did this one show and how did that weigh and do two-year deliberations? So we're going to release the results of the SLU's on May 8th in line with our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLU's is broadly consistent when you see it with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we're seeing from other sources. You will have seen the beige book and listen to the various earnings calls that indicate that mid-size banks have, some of them have been tightening their lending standards. Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year. Let's go to Nick. Nick Temerowski, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as you've discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year. So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today or put differently. If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you've, for the last two meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the committee feel it was necessary to keep moving? Well, the reason is that we, again, with our monetary policy, we're trying to reach and then stay at an extended period, a level of policy stance that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation at 2% over time. And that's what we're trying to do with our tool. I think slowing down was the right move. I think it's enabled us to see more data and it will continue to do so. So we really, we have to balance. We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard's question, you'll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six week intermeeting cycle? I, yeah, I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one. So you know, you can't with economic data. You can't, you've seen take inflation from it. Look, look back. We've seen inflation come down, move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We've seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you're going to want to see that, you know, that a few months of data will persuade you that you've got this right kind of thing. And you know, we have the luxury. We've raised 500 basis points. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably that you can calculate them many different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a reasonable estimate of, let's say one year in flora.",-0.000194236045354,0.004288185561484275
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:55:00,2023-05-03 19:00:00," which might be 3%, so you've got 2% real rates that's meaningfully above what most people would, many people, anyway would assess as the neutral rate. So policy is tight, and you see that in interest, interest sensitive activities, and you also begin to see it more and more in other activities. And if you put the, you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that's ongoing, I think you feel like we're, we may not be far off, or we could possibly even add that level. Thank you, Edward. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3% inflation, as the projections show at the end of this year, or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3% inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2% target? I think we're always going to have 2% as our target. We're always going to be focusing on getting there. I'd be okay with, would they pull on 3%. You know, it's, let me just say that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for inflation going down to 2% over time. I mean, we, that's not a question that's in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But ultimately, we're not looking to get to 3%, and then drop our tools. We have a goal of getting to 2%. We think it's going to take some time. We don't think it'll be a smooth process. And, you know, I think we're going to need to stay at this for a while. How does the other side of the mandate, the job side, won't you get to 3% going from 3 to 2? How does the other side of the mandate, with balance? I think they, you know, they will both matter equally at that point. Right now, you have a labor market that's still extraordinarily tight. You've still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening and labor market conditions, but overall, you're near a 50-year low and unemployment wages. You all will have seen the wage number from late last week, and it's, you know, whenever it was, and, you know, it's a couple of percentage points above what would be consistent with 2% inflation over time. So we do see some softening. We see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But the labor market is very, very strong. Whereas inflation is, you know, running high, well above our, well above our goal, and right now we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we've been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. Matt. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boso with Bloomberg News. So many analysts know at the time of the March FOMC meeting that, at least half of Fed officials' projections did imply, or seem to imply, that a recession was in their baseline forecast as well, given the strong first quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I'm just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you're optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that's the Fed staff's forecast, possibly also the broader committees forecast as well, and also, of course, most private sector forecasts. Yeah, I don't think, you know, I know what's printed in the summer of economic projections and all that. I don't think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don't know what they were thinking for first quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number anyway. In any case, I'll just say, I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different. And the reason is there's just so much excess demand really in the labor market. It's interesting is, you know, we raise rates by five percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is three and a half percent, pretty much where it was even lower than it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see, by surveys and much, much evidence that conditions are cooling gradually, but it really is different. You know, it wasn't supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much as they've declined without unemployment going up. Well, that's what we've seen. So there are no promises in this, but it just seems to me that it's possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I fully appreciate that. That would be against the pattern. But I do think that this, that the situation in the labor market with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually, we just have been moving down. Weige increases have been moving down. And that's a good sign down to more sustainable levels. So I think that, I think it's still possible. I think, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,",0.001026083155236,0.003914322530451517
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 19:00:00,2023-05-03 19:05:00," of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having a recession. But it's not that the case of having a recession is, I don't rule that out either. It's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mile recession. The committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation. Do you see that as well? And could you kind of explain how you come to that judgment? Sure. So we look at a range of wage measures and then that's phenomenal. So you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation. And so you can look at the employment compensation index average hourly earnings, see Atlanta wage tracker compensation per hour, basically those four and many others. You can look at what they would have to run at over a long period of time to be consistent with 2% inflation. They can deviate. Corporate margins can go up and down and there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down where labor gets a bigger share in our session. Sorry, later in expansion. So yeah, and we calculate those and you have to take the precision with a degree of salt. But I would say that what they will show is that if the wages are running at 5%, 3% is closer to where they need to be. A wage increase isn't closer to 3% roughly is what it would take to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. By the way, I don't want to... I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You're asking me a very specific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together and it's very hard to say what's causing what. But I've never said that wages are really the principal driver because I don't think that's really right. Great. Chris Regabre, I'd associated press. So you mentioned profit margins. Those have expanded, did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven't fallen as much as might be expected, given that we're seeing at least some pull back among consumer spending. So speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months? So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand. Too much demand, not enough supply. And we've been in a situation in many parts of the economy where supply has been fixed or not flexible enough. And so the way the market clears is through higher prices. So to get, I think as goods pipelines have gotten back to normal so that we don't have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing, I think you will see inflation come down and you'll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition where there's enough supply to meet demand. And then it's then you're really back to full competition. That's that would be the dynamic I would expect. Michael McKee from Blueburg Radio and television. Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is? Your policy framework is going forward when you look at the economy at the next meeting. Are you looking at incoming data, which is by definition backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in? I didn't catch the last part of ruling. My markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay. That's what are we looking at? I mean, we look at a combination of data and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we're always looking at both. And it will, of course, it'll be the obvious things. It'll be readings on inflation. It'll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things. I think a particular focus for us going now over the past six, seven weeks now, and going forward is going to be what's happening with credit tightening. Our small and medium-sized banks, tightening credit standards. And is that having an effect on loans, on lending? And so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy. That'll be an important thing. I just, you know, we'll be looking at everything. It's, again, I would just point out we've raised rates.",-0.0004667609892616,0.003624245962249487
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 19:05:00,2023-05-03 19:10:00," by five percentage points, we are shrinking the balance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening, not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more due to what's happened. And we have to factor all of that in and make our assessment of whether our policy stands as sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable legs. So this is challenging. But we will make our best assessment, and that's what we're thinking. What about the idea of rate cuts? Yeah, so we on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly, but it will take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates and we won't cut rates. If you have a different forecast, markets have been from time to time pricing and quite rapid reductions in inflation. We'd factor that in, but that's not our forecast. And of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down. Particularly now, if you look at non-housing services, it really hasn't moved much and it's quite stable. And so we think we'll have to demand, we'll have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And again, in that world, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to cut rates. Courtney? Courtney Brown from Axios. I'm curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you think it's contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits? And did the committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. It's really not contributing. We don't think now it hasn't actually been growing. We moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the, when there were the big deposit flows, which by the way have really stabilized now, what happened was institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the federal home loan banks and things like that. Over the course of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradually, as they do in every tightening cycle, they've been gradually moving their deposits into higher yielding places such as CDs and other things including money market funds. So that's a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a tightening cycle. What was unusual really was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around things like that. But it doesn't seem to have had any effect overall on the overnight repurposility. That is really there to help us keep rates where they're supposed to be and it's soaring that purpose very well. Sarah. Sarah, you all waste CBS news. I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy. But can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets and borrowing? And I would just say it's, I don't really think we shouldn't even be talking about a world in which the US doesn't pay its bills. It just shouldn't be a thing. And again, I would just say we don't, no one should assume that the Fed can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from the damage that such an event might inflict. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last week, Vice Chair Bard identified a couple of factors that he thought contributed to the regulatory, or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank. A policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny. And also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019. Do you share that view and what would it take to get the stronger oversight that you and he said it and your release would be necessary? So I didn't take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do. I have read it, of course, and I find it persuasive.

I think the only thing that I'm really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is, it may just have been technology evolving, we have to keep up with all that, but some of it may be our policies and supervisor and regulatory, whatever. Well, what our job is now is identify those things and implement them. And that's kind of the only thing I care about is, and I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. Can I add that? Thank you, Evan Reiser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking terminal among regional banks? And secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying? So, I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks really from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved and all the deposits have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of first republic kind of draws a line under that period of, is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of severe stress, okay? I also think we are very focused on what's happening with credit availability, particularly with what you saw in the beige book and you will see in the sleuths is medium size, small and small, small, medium size banks are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards, build liquidity. What's going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we will continue to very carefully monitor what's going on in the banking system and will factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way going forward. Great. Thank you, Fitzgerald. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just wondered if you've done any reflection on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last, since you've been, Fitzgerald, I think I've heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the vice chair for supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go about this and comments on that, thank you. Sure, so let me say first of all, I've been chair of the board for five plus years now and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we've learned some new things as well and we need to do better. And as I mentioned, I thought the report was on flinching inappropriately. So I welcome it and I agree with and we'll support those recommendations and I do feel that I'm personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So on the vice chair for supervision, the place to start is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The vice chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations develop policy recommendations for the board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution companies and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms. So this is Congress establishing a four year term for someone else on the board, not the chair, as vice chair for supervision, who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the board of governors. Congress wanted that person to be, to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it works, the way it has worked in practice for me is I've had a good working relationship. I give my council my input privately, and that's, I offer that, and I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with vice chair bar and as predecessor. And I think that's the way it's supposed to work, and that's appropriate. I believe that's what the law requires. And, you know, but it isn't, I wouldn't say it's a matter of complete deference. It's more, I have a role in presenting my views and discussing having an intelligent discussion about what's going on and why, and you know, that's my...",-0.0024096972057247,0.003100737340690558
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 19:15:00,2023-05-03 19:19:12," input but ultimately that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of Governors and really in supervision has sole authority over supervision. I just wondered if you had any regrets. Was there anything that you know decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what's happened? I've had a few. Sure. I mean, you know, who doesn't look back and think that you could have done things differently. But honestly, you don't get to do that. Again, my focus is on what you control the controlable as one of my great mentors used to always say control the controlable. What we control now is make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are and implement them. And I think that Vice Chair of ours report is an excellent first step in that but we've got to fall through. Great. Thank you. Hi there, Megan Casalo with Barrens. Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all and how seriously was that considered? I'm curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board. I would say there are a number of people and you'll see this in the minutes. I don't want to try to do the head count in real time but people did talk about pausing but not so much at this meeting. There's a sense that we're much closer to the end of this than to the beginning that as I mentioned, if you add up all the tightening that's going on through various channels, we feel like we're getting close or maybe even there. But that again, that's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to be looking at those factors that we listed in to determine whether there's more to do. I'm curious to you how to interpret that and the changes to the statement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting where would a strong jobs reporter inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again? I don't want to. I couldn't really say. I just think we're, I think we've moved a long way fairly quickly and I think we can afford to look at the data and make a careful assessment. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall Gensere with Marketplace. You mentioned a few times about the lessons you learned from the banking crisis that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons? Well, I just would start with something that's changed really, which is the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history. That now needs to be reflected in some way in regulation and in supervision. We know that we know it's possible. I think we didn't know and thought that was possible. I'm not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so quite so quickly. So I think that that will play through, it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think that's one thing. I guess I would just say that. Obviously we're going to revisit. It's pretty clear we need to me anyway. It's clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I'm thinking that we're on the track to do that as well. Any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy? Yeah, that's what Vice Chair Barr's role really is. He'll take the lead on that. Thank you. Thank you.",0.0003415967206715,0.0033716100659662725
2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged, and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2% over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Although growth and consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect a subdued growth to continue. In our summary of economic projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0% this year and 1.1% next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May at 3.7%. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs to workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceed as the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1% at the end of this year and 4.5% at the end of next year. Inflation remains well above our longer run 2% goal. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 4.4%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.7%. In May, the 12 months changing the consumer price index came in at 4%, and the change in the core CPI was 5.3%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2% this year, 2.5% next year, and 2.1% in 2025. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9% this year. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided.",3.4522836856549226e-05,0.0028574062125541737
2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:35:00,2023-06-14 18:40:00," by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that a high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of how far we've come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and potential headwinds from credit tightening. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. As I noted earlier, nearly all committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we've moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves, as projected, the median participant projects at the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6% at the end of this year, 4.6% at the end of 2024 and 3.4% at the end of 2025. For the end of this year, the median projection is a half percentage point higher than in our March projections. By hastened to add, as always, that these projections are not a committee decision or plan, if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. We do, at the Fed, in service to our public mission. We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Colby. Thank you, Colby Smith, with the financial times. I'm curious what gives you and the committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated, interest rate sensitive sectors like housing, while they felt the drag of the past Fed actions have started to recover in some regions and financial conditions, you know, most recently we're easing. So I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence. And that of the speed of tightening the level to which rates would need to go in a period of time over which we need to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up and we moved very quickly by historical standards.",0.0016571152385554,0.003222465185867267
2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:40:00,2023-06-14 18:45:00," consecutive 75 basis point hikes we moderated to a pace of 50 basis point hikes and then this year to 325 basis point hikes at sequential meetings. So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rate steady at this meeting, I would just say it's a continuation of that process. The main issue that we're focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy forming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time. So the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables. Given how far we have come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace. I want to stress one more thing and that is that the committee decision made today was only about this meeting. We didn't make any decision about going forward including what would happen at the next meeting including we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every other meeting kind of an approach or really any other approach. We really were focused on what to do at this meeting. So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move. So again we didn't we didn't make a decision about July any of course it came up in the meeting from time to time but really the focus was on what to do today. I would say about July two things. One decision hasn't been made to I do expect that it will be a live meeting. Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the narrative here because it feels like there's been a level shift in the dots. Stronger GDP less of a hit on employment, slower progress on inflation and I'm wondering in this sort of where's the disinflation coming from. The labor market is going to be stronger it looks like it's not coming from there. Demand is not coming down all that fast according to GDP. You've doubled your estimate of GDP so what's the narrative here? It seems like it's getting more immaculate rather than more messy. So you're right that the data came in I would say consistent with but on the high side of expectations. So and if you go back to the former SEP the last SEP in March you will see that growth moved up. These are not huge moves but growth estimates moved up a bit unemployment estimates moved down a bit inflation estimates moved up to bit and you know the all three of those kind of pointing the same direction which is you know that perhaps more restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So although the level frankly is pretty the level of 5.6 is pretty consistent if you think about it where the federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March. So but so we've kind of going back to that. So your question is where's the disinflation going to come from and you know I don't think the story has really changed. The committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one it's going to take some time and I think you go back to the to the three-part framework for core PC inflation which is we think as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward you start with goods with goods we need to see continued healing and supply conditions supply side conditions they've definitely improved a substantial amount but if you talk to people in business they will say it's not back to where it was so that's that's one thing and that should enable goods prices to continue because because inflation to continue to come down over time. In terms of housing services inflation that's another big piece and you are seeing there that new rents new new leases are coming in at low levels and it's really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline. In fact I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose of this year and next year will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source and that's again probably going to come slower than we would affect. That leaves the big sector which is a little more than half pardon me of the core PC inflation that's not housing services and we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there it's a sector it's a very broad and diverse sector I would say in a number of the parts of that sector the largest cost would be wage costs it's a service sector so it's heavily labor intensive and I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions which we have seen we have actually seen you know I could go through a number of indicators suggesting there's been some loosening in labor market conditions we need to see that continue. I would almost say that the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down or",0.0030330185427724,0.0035850530863630148

It would be good pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing. The things are in place that we need to see but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell what's the value in pausing and signalling future hikes versus just hiking now? I mean not to be flippant but I don't lose weight just by buying a gym membership. I have to actually go to the gym. 16 of your colleagues put down a higher year end 23 rate today. A majority of you think you're going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year. So why not just rip off the bandaid and raise rates today? So the first I would say that the question of speed is a separate question from the from from that of level. Okay so and I think if you look at the SCP that is our estimate our individual is it's really a accumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go I I mentioned how how we got to those numbers. In terms of speed it's it's what I said at the beginning which is speed was very important last year as we get closer and closer to the destination and according to the SCP we're not so far away from the destination in most people's accounting. It's it's reasonable it's common sense to go a little slower just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting and so the committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace if only slightly and there are benefits to that so that gives us more information to make decisions we may try to make better decisions I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we as we make our decisions going forward and we'll get to see you know we haven't really we don't know the full extent of of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we've seen we it would be early to see those but we don't know what the extent is we'll have some more time to see that unfold it's it's just the idea that we're trying to get this right and that this is if you think of the two things as separate variables then I think I think that the skip I shouldn't call the skip the decision makes sense I know you said July is live with only one June employment with only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting you get the ECI after you get the senior loan officer survey after you get some bank earnings at the end of next month what incremental information will the committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is in fact a skip or a longer pause well I think you're adding that to the data that we've seen since the last meeting too you know we since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting is it'll really be a three month period of data that we can look at I think that's a full quarter and I think you can you can draw more conclusions from that than you come from any six any six week period we'll look at those things we'll also look at the evolving risk picture we'll look at what's happening in the financial sector we'll look at all the data the evolving outlook and we'll make a decision thanks for daycare questions genus myelic nighartimes you obviously in your forecast marked up the sort of path for growth marked down the path for unemployment marked up the path for inflation pretty notably I wonder you know since March what has changed to make you think that the economies a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn and given that you know why do you feel confident that this is as high as you're going to have to revise the federal funds rate or do you think it's possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this this cycle you know I mean on the first part I just think we're following the data and also the outlook the economy is the labor market I think has surprised many if not all analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience really and it's just remarkable and that's really if you think about it that's what's driving it's its job creation it's it's a wages moving up it's it's supporting spending which in turn is supporting hiring and it's it's really the engine it seems that it's that is driving the economy so it's it's really the data in terms of you know we we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year that's that's how we do it it's based on our our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is it can be it can actually in reality wind up being lower or higher and I you know there's really no way to know but it's it's it's it's what people think as of today and as the as a data come in it can move around,0.0008017592889539,0.0023629814861548318

I can't tell you that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance. Mr. Chairman, thanks for the question. You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into ballots. Is that still the case or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there? And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate? Is the, obviously the current rate, according to the committee, is not sufficiently restrictive? Is it five, six? Is it six, where is this sufficiently restrictive? Thank you. You know, I would say again that I think that over time, the balance of risks as we move from, very, you know, from interest rates that are effectively zero now to five percentage points with an SEP calling for additional hikes. I think we've moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate. And I think that means, almost by definition, that the risks of sort of overdoing it and underdoing it are getting closer to being in balance. I still think, and my colleagues agree, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still. So we don't think we're there with inflation yet because we're just looking at the data. Now, if you look at the full range of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just aren't seeing a lot of progress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but as you know, we look at core as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going. This officially, so I think, you know, what we'd like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That's what we want to see. Of course, that's what we want to see. And I think it's also, we understand that there are lags, but remember that it's more than a year since financial conditions began tightening. I think the reason we're comfortable pausing is that we are still much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year. And I think it's reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect. So we're, you know, I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate until to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more with more data over time. Rachel? Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask further on the lag effects. When you're considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come into effect that would inform your decisions? Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect? Yeah. So it's a challenging thing in economics. It's sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags. Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes. So if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off. By the time we had lifted off the two year, which is a pretty good estimate of where policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points. So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where news was in newspapers and not on the wire. So that's different. But it's still the case that what you see is interest sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly. So housing and durable goods and things like that. But broader demand and spending and asset values and things like that, they just take longer. And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that. So there's not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes. So then that makes it challenging, of course. So we're looking at the calendar. We're looking at what's happening in the economy. We're having to make these judgments. Again, it's one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate pace now as we seek that ultimate. I can't point to a specific data point. I think we'll see it when we see inflation really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften. I think we'll know that we're that it's working. And ideally by taking a little more time, we won't go well past the level where we need to go. I was curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on credit tightening since the bank incidents from March and how you're teasing that out apart from these lagifists. So it's too early still to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean. And that's something we're going to be.",-0.0005294344253233,0.002546046746335658
2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:55:00,2023-06-14 19:00:00," watching, of course. And if we were to see what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of this channel, then we would factor that into account on making rate decisions. So that's how we think about it. Let's go to Chris. Thanks, Chris Regaber, and I've associated press. You mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see core services X housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months. And as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices, and then we've had some quirks in used car prices. So given that these trends are in place, I guess I'm sort of asking the flip side of Nick's question, why signal additional rate hikes aren't things headed in the direction you need? Why not simply give it even more time or I mean, it's surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots given what we're seeing recently. Yeah, so we remember we've were two and a half years into this or two and a quarter years into this, and forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and traditionally not typically forecasted that it would and been wrong. So I think if you look at the core PCE inflation overall, look at it over the last six months, you're just not seeing a lot of progress. It's running and it's running at a level, you know, over four and a half percent, far above our target and not really, you know, moving down. We want to see it moving down decisively. That's all. Of course, we are going to get inflation down to two percent over time. We don't want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course. We have to get inflation down to two percent and we will. And we just don't see that yet. So the hence you see today's policy decision both to write down for the rate hikes by the end of this year, but also to, you know, to take, to moderate somewhat the pace with which we're moving. Quick follow up. I mean, the last press conference you mentioned, you didn't see wages driving inflation and, you know, there was some research from the San Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren't necessarily key driver, but you've talked about the labor market today and the need for softening. Can you give us a little more specifically of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point? Thank you. Right. So I'm not going to comment on any particular paper, but I would say that the, I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for largely for goods. People were still at home. They had money in the bank and they wanted to spend and they spent a lot on goods and of course at the same time. And because of that high demand to some extent, supply chains got all snorled up. So prices went way up, inflation went way up. That was the origin and it wasn't really particularly about the labor market or wages. But as you moved into, through 21 to 22 and now in 23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important, an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the non-housing services sector, getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable that is consistent with 2% inflation. We actually have seen wages broadly moved down, but just did a quite gradual pace. And that's a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with what I would think. Michael McKeefer, Bluebird Radio and Television. You said in the past that you don't like to surprise markets. It's kind of been the Fed's view. Markets should have an idea of what you're going to do before you go in. You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down. You reiterated that again today and that we would get to a point where inflation could be sticky. So I'm wondering as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function. What will you be reacting to time or data? In other words, if nothing much changes, if we're looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November, will you move? Because you've said you feel you need to, is it time that's going to require additional movement or would it be your reversal in inflation? So I don't want to deal with hypotheticals about different ways data might move out. So we, of course, we don't go out of our way to surprise markets or the public. At the same time, our main focus has to be.",-0.0007053542802181,0.001857074076621506

I will say that July meeting will be live. And we'll just have to see. I think you'll see the data. You'll hear fed people talking about it and markets will have to make a judgment. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to know what's happening? I think if you look at, if you just look at, I'll just point you to the forecast. So inflation is running. Core PCU's inflation is running at about 4.5, a little higher than 4.5%. And the median F1C participant thinks it'll go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis. This is by the end of this year. So that's expecting pretty substantial progress. That's a pretty significant decline for half a year. So that's the forecast. We do try to be transparent in our reaction function. We're committed to getting inflation down. And that's the number one thing. So that's how I think about it. It's going to Victoria. Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you're thinking about it? What are you looking for to judge whether we're approaching reserve scarcity and is treasury issuance going to affect that also are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks? So let me say first of all, on the treasury part of it, if I can talk about that, and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that, of course, we've been very focused on that for a couple of months. As everyone has, treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly. I think we all saw. I saw the Secretary's comments yesterday to the effect that treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid market disruption and that they're going to watch carefully for that. So that's from the treasury, which actually sets the borrowings. At the Fed, we'll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the treasury refills the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both the reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves. It's really hard to say at the beginning of this, which will be greater. We are starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated RRP to take up for that matter. So we don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year. So that's the treasury part of the answer. We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we're prepared to make adjustments to make sure that monetary policy transmission works. Was there another part of your question? Yeah. Are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks? So we have a number of, I would say, the RRP doesn't look like it's pulling money out of the banking system. It's actually been shrinking here lately. So I don't think that's not something we've thought about a lot over time. It doesn't really look like that's something we would do. I think it's a tool that we have. If we want to use it, we can. There are other tools we can use to address money market issues. But I wouldn't say that that's something that's likely that we would do in the near term. How long? Janelle Marte with Bloomberg. Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecast? And how does it factor into monetary policy? So certainly housing, very interest-sensitive. And it's the first place, really, in one of the first places that's either helped by low rates or that is held back by higher rates. And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year. We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit. We're watching that situation carefully. I do think we will see rents and house prices filtering into housing services inflation. And I don't see them coming up quickly. I do see them kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now. And that's appropriate. Do you think you'll have to target with further rate increases? Well, I think we look at everything. We don't just look at housing. So I think the way it works is individual participants sit in their offices all over the country and they write down their forecast. And including their most likely forecast, including their rate forecast. And then they send it in on Friday afternoon. And we accumulate it.",0.0010541512936269,0.0017191188942627272

Well, I don't know that housing is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it's part of it. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about in the past, about unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be 2.8 trillion in 10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be 52 trillion by 2033. At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because I'm assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher level spending? I don't do that. That's really not my job. We hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on monetary policy. And we don't see ourselves as the judges of appropriate fiscal policy. I will say, and many of my predecessors have said that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path, and that needs to be addressed over time. But I think trying to get into that with lawmakers would be inappropriate given our independence and our need to stick to our netting. Is there any conversation then about the federal's financing some of that debt that we're seeing come not the pike? No. Under no circumstances. Courtney. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. So looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly, or forecast for GDP this year. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward. And so should we take that as a sign that the committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing, at least as it relates to what you're expecting in March? You know, I would just say it this way. I continue to think, and this really hasn't changed, that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment that we've seen in so many past instances. It's possible in a way a strong labor market is that gradually cools, could aid that along. It could aid that along. But I guess I want to come back to the main thing, which is, though, simply this, we see the committee, as you can see from the SEP, the committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2%. And we'll do whatever it takes to get it down to 2% over time. That is our plan. And we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the US economy is the thing that we cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today's workers and families and businesses, but also for the future. Getting price stability back and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it's sustained. And it really is the bedrock of the economy. And you should understand that that is our top priority. Just a quick follow-up on that. I'm just a little confused because you said the committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time. But when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year. But the Fed funds rate is lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that? Sure. So if you look two and three years out with the forecast, first of all, I wouldn't put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they're so highly uncertain. But what they're showing is that as inflation comes down in the forecast, if you don't lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up. So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point two years out, let's say, should come down just to maintain real rates. And actually, since we're probably going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly, so for us to get inflation down, that probably means that that certainly means that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly. And again, we're talking about a couple years out. I think as anyone can see, not a single person on the committee wrote down a rate cut this year. Nor do I think it is all likely to be appropriate. If you think about it, inflation has not really moved down. It is not so far reacted much to our existing rate hikes. And so we're going to have to keep that. Julie. I'm Rachel for our Jewish Abedist, anything? I'm Michael Scott. I'm sorry.",0.002724234238359,0.0031365905032281803

Is it consistent with the Fed's maximum employment mandate? Are you worried about that about this rebound? So we are, of course, worried about. There are longstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across our labor market. That's a factor that we can't really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment, it is for us a broad and inclusive goal. And so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows, historic modern lows here. So we're still talking about, I mean, is a strong labor market, as we've seen in half century here in the United States. So overall, unemployment of 3.7% is 310 higher than it was a measure to be at the last month ago. But still, it's extraordinarily low. And so it's a very, very tight labor market. Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the right question on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how we all back up. We haven't quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet. And we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there's not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how that played into today's outcome? I wouldn't say that's, you know, as a factual matter that's correct. We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want the inflation to come down into rental is a very large part of the CPI about a third and it's about half of that for the PCE. So it's important. And so we're something that we're watching very carefully. It's part of the overall picture. I wouldn't say it's the decisive part, but take a step back. What you see is look at core inflation over the past six months year, you're just not seeing a lot of progress, not the kind of progress we want to see. And that's, it's hard to avoid that. And, you know, the committee, people in the committee, the median went up significantly so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on 12 month basis will be 3.9% this year. So once again, every year, for the past three years, it's going up over the course of the year and that's doing that again. So we see that and we see that inflation forecast are coming in low again. And we see that that tells us that we need to do more. And so we're, that's why you see the SEP with where it is. Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and given the recent slowdown in core services, excluding housing? How far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line? So wages will continue to increase. So we, you know, what we're talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so I think we've seen some progress. All of the major measures of wages have moved down from extremely elevated, not extremely, highly elevated levels a year or so ago and they're moving back down but quite gradually. And, you know, we want to see that process continue. Gradually, of course, it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2% which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst and the fastest by high inflation. Thank you so much, Chair Pograeg Robb from Markerwatch. I just wondered if the committee has talked at all about the labor market and there's strikes now and Hollywood and now the United Auto Workers are talking about a possible strike. I mean, aren't workers, we have some workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages. Does that come up in your discussions? Thanks. So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market is about as central a topic toward discussions as anything. I mean, it's very labor economics and a labor market are utterly central. It's half of our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think we...",-0.0035272361992602,0.0037576757400787884

But we look and we see what's going on, and we're making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2% in the aggregate. As I said, don't think that was about, I didn't, most folks would say now, it wasn't really about that, about wages at the beginning, and it's becoming more about that as we get into really service sector inflation, which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress. It's good to mark for the last question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bank Rate. Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk, now that we're about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and also specifically, what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as non-bank financials, and could you further elevate those risks with higher still rates possibly for longer? So we're trying to think where to start. I'll start with commercial real estate. We, of course, were watching that situation very carefully. There's a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system. A large part of it is in smaller banks. It's well distributed. To the extent it's well distributed, then the system could take losses. We do expect that there will be losses, but there will be banks that have concentrations, and those banks will experience larger losses, so we're well aware of that. We're monitoring it carefully. It feels like something that will be around for some time, as opposed to something that will suddenly hit and work its way in the systemic risk. In terms of non-bank financial sector, there's been a ton of work, and clearly in the pandemic, it really was the non-bank financial sector where issues really arose, and there's a lot of work going on with the administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the treasury market and in all kinds of areas, non-bank financial market. Our jurisdiction at the Fed is over banks. It's actually bank holding companies and some banks, so that's really our main focus. In terms of the events of March, as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation. Our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong, and that would include the banks who might be hard for me to identify something that we don't worry about, rather than that we do worry about. So we're watching those things very carefully. As we see things unfold, as we see what's happening with credit conditions, and also all the individual banks that are out there, we'll be able to take to the extent it's appropriate. We can take, if they're macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting. And so I guess that's what I would say. That's all right. Do you risk further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points? So that's, and I guess I meant to address that by saying, as we watch, we'll see what's happening. And if we're seeing the kind of tightening of conditions that you could be referring to, then we can factor that. Because really, we use our rate tool, it really has macroeconomic purposes, so we'll take that into account. Of course, we have responsibility for financial stability as well, and that also is a factor that we're always going to be considering. Thank you very much.",-0.000504043805989,0.0019863696713137632
2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Today, we took another step by raising our policy interest rate a quarter percentage point and we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Looking ahead, we will continue to take a data dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. I'll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Foreign indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year. Although activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, job gains averaged 244,000 jobs per month. A pace below that scene earlier in the year, but still a strong pace. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6%. There are some continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8%. Following the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6%. In June, the 12 months change in the consumer price index or CPI came in at 3.0%, and the change in the core CPI was 4.8%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposed a significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher cost of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning to inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 5.255%. We are also continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today's action, we've raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points since early last year. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy.",0.0005059975789589,0.0014088537653819165
2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:35:00,2023-07-26 18:40:00," with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Steve. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I think a couple of times in your opening remarks talked about this language in determining the extent of additional policy firmly that may be appropriate. Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on the way and should we also believe that all future meetings say September and November are live or are you in a every other meeting mode? Thank you. So we haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. It's not something we've looked at. We're going to be going meeting by meeting. And as we go into each meeting, we're going to be asking ourselves the same question. So we haven't made any decisions about any future meetings, including the pace at which we consider hiking. But we're going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate. You read the language to return inflation to 2% over time. I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations. Economic activity remained resilient. Job creation remained strong while cooling a bit. And the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI report, of course, was welcome. But it's only one report, one month's data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as it will be consistent with the CPI reading. But we don't know that, and we're just going to need to see more data. So what are we going to be looking at? Really it will be the broader, the whole broader picture. And starting with, we're looking for moderate growth. We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including in particular in the labor market. We'll be looking at inflation. We'll be asking ourselves, does this whole collection of data as do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that's how we're thinking about the next meeting. And how we're thinking about meetings going forward potentially. But we're now mainly thinking about the next meeting. I will also say, since we're talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports. I think we have an ECI report coming later this week, which is an employment compensation index. And lots of data on economic activity. All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting. And I'll close by saying we've raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022. Monetary policy, we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there, you said the data in the intervening period, it probably came in in line with expectations. Does that mean there's unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the committee that two more hikes are necessary? I'm just going to go back to what I said. That's the question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting and all that data that I've decided. We're going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And really, we did have the one good reading. And of course, we welcome that, but it's just one reading. As everybody knows, and we've seen this before in the data, many forecasts call for inflation to remain low, but we just don't know that until we see the data. So we'll be focusing on that. Gina. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Obviously, you upgraded the language around growth in the statement today. We've seen the Barbie movie numbers. We've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this summer. It seems like the American consumers in pretty good shape. And it does seem like growth is picking back up a little better, at least doing well. And I wonder from your perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing, but performing well this summer, is that a problem? Because...",0.0038076593123776,0.004157409647829978
2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:40:00,2023-07-26 18:45:00," is it's inflationary or is it good news because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely? Just how are you thinking about that sort of trajectory? Yeah, so I would say it this way. The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy. Overall, that's good thing. It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that. That will support you get activity going forward. But you're right, though, at the margin, stronger growth could lead over time to higher inflation and that would require an appropriate response from monetary policy. So we'll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time. Neil. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil, everyone from Axios. So as you referenced earlier in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, job support, still strong, but moderating, jolts, things good. So if your data dependence, why not pause again? Why not stay on hold? Why not take another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see? So if you go back to what we're trying to do here, we're trying to achieve a stance of policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2%. At the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of what that would take. And the meeting of that was an additional two rate hikes. So I would say we looked at the intermeeting data and as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent, but broadly consistent with expectations. And as a result, we went ahead and took another step. And that's a labor market that continues to be strong, but gradually slowing. I mentioned that the inflation report is actually a little better than expected, but we're going to be careful about taking too much signal from a single reading. And growth came in stronger than expected. So that's how we look at it. And so we did take that step today. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell markets widely believed the median FOMC participants inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter of this year will be too high, a given auto as a shelter. And that by September that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points. Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here? Or do you need to see below trend growth and to accelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you've done enough? So it's hard to pick the pieces apart and say, how much of this and how much of that. We'll be looking at everything. And of course we'll be looking to see whether the signal from June CPI is replicated or the opposite of replicated or whether it's somewhere in the middle. We'll be looking at the growth data, we'll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall judgment about that. It's the totality of the data, I think. But with a particular focus on making progress on inflation. If I could follow up last month, you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions. Would another CPI report, like the one we just had in June, allow you to at least maintain that slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike? So I'm just going to tell you again, what we're going to do in September. We're going to look at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data. And that's what we're going to look at. And we're going to make that decision then. And that decision could mean another hike in September or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level. And again, the question we're going to be asking ourselves is the overall signal one that we need to do more, that we need to tighten further. And if we get that signal whenever we get it, then that's the collective judgment of the committee, then we will move ahead. If we don't, then we'll have the option of maintaining policy at that level. But it's really dependent so much on the data, and we just don't have it yet. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruggiever, associated press. So consumer confidence in the economy is rising likely in large part because of the declines and headline inflation. You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long time. How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3%. And with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate? So I guess I'd say it this way. First, it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much because that's really what the public experiences. And I would say that having headline inflation moved down that much almost creates a, it will strengthen the,",0.0005916511449544,0.0018634629718946437
2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:45:00,2023-07-26 18:50:00," broad sense that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really sorry, but what your question was. Well, I mean, you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three? So I guess I would put it this way. We, I'd say it this way. It's really a question of how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too little. And, you know, we, I would say that, you know, we're coming to a place where, where there really are risks on both sides. It's hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not. But as our, as our stance has become more restrictive, and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk. But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far. You know, as, as you know, we think, and most economists think that core inflation is actually a better signal of, of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices. So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that's what we think is, that's core is, is signaling where headlines going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know. There's a reason to think it, it can come down now, but it's, it's still quite elevated. So we think we need to stay on task, and we think we're going to need to hold, certainly hold policy at a restricted levels for some time. And we need to be prepared to raise further if that, if we think that's appropriate. Well, and then, if inflation were to just a quick follow, if it stays at three or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation? People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation. So, but how much, again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one? So it is, it is a very positive thing that actually the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of 22, at 3.6%. So that's a real blessing, and that we've been able to achieve some disinflation. And we don't seek to, it's not that we're aiming to raise unemployment, but I would just say the historical record. We have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. And so that is still the likely outcome here. And we hope that that's as little as possible. We have to be honest that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done. However, the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-term social costs of failing to do so are greater. And that the historical record is very, very clear on that. If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile. It interferes with people's lives and with economic activity. And that's the thing we really need to avoid and will avoid. At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation lately to the downside. So I'm wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions? Do you think you might need to do more? Because I'm curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now, as the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation. People talk about base effects and higher energy costs. And now we have some large labor settlements. Or is the economy disinflating? And you're just able to go back to the old-fed policy of opportunistic disinflation. So I'll just say, again, the broader picture of what we want to see is we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to demand and supply. We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures. We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market, and all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. And what we see is we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together, and we're seeing evidence, those things now. But I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down, sustainably toward our 2% target, and we're prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process still probably has a long way to go. Well, do you think under current conditions you are restricting?",-0.0010512023126451,0.002106002106002186

Well I think we think you know today's rate hike was appropriate and I think we're going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at the next meeting about is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more and if it does tell us that collectively if that's our view then we will do more. Thank you Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Next September is in fact a live meeting. How does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month and explaining the rationale for holding the funds rate steady at the June meeting? So a more gradual pace doesn't go immediately to every other meeting. It could be two out of three meetings right? It could be it just means if you're slowing down the point what really was to slow down the decision cycle as we get closer and closer to we think our destination and I wouldn't want to go automatically to every other meeting because I just don't think that's we don't I think it's not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finally judged decisions. And so that's what we did and so I think it's possible I mentioned before it's possible that we would move it consecutive means we're not taking that off the table or we might not. It's really going to depend on what the data tell us. That's the best we can do. So we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency let's say. It could be longer intervals in between as well. I think we're going to make a decision about the next meeting and then we're going to make a decision about the one after that and I think it'll sort itself out. Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. So among your colleagues there have been people who've said they feel that very little transmission has taken place so far from monetary policy into the economy and there are those who feel they say it's happened very fast this time and it's kind of up to date. Where are you on that continuum? So there's a long running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation. So we know that in the modern era financial conditions move in anticipation of our decisions and that has clearly been the case in this cycle. So in a sense the clock starts earlier than it used to but that doesn't necessarily change the process from that point on and it's not clear that it has. We also we this is I'll tell you what we know and then what we don't know. We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation where the lags can be long and variable or lags plural that can be long and variable. A lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags and by the way that's just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face. So I'll tell you how I think about this. First the first thing to say is we're determined to bring inflation down to 2% over time and we will use our tools to do that. No one should doubt that. I would look at it this way though. The real federal funds rate is now in a meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal federal funds rate subtract a mainstream estimate of near term inflation expectations you get a real federal funds rate that is well above most estimates of the longer term neutral rate. So I would say monetary policy is restrictive more so after today's decision meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. We'll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it's not appropriate to do so. So that's how I think about it. I mean if I sum it up I would say we come a long way. We are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal over time. Inflation has proved repeatedly, has proved stronger than we and other forecast forecasters have expected. And at some point that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data and given how far we've come we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold. On the credit side I'm wondering if you saw anything in the latest slew state of the major you think you're getting a quantum of credit contraction beyond what you'd expect. The bank lending data really is the growth rates edging down towards and heading below zero which is usually an unferential indicator. So I guess the slew will come out early next week and I would just say it's broadly consistent with what you would expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter. You've got weak demand and it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it's really hard to tease out whether how much of that is from this source or that source. But I think what matters is the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions and that's what this is.",0.0007673082825448,0.0015794322818408512

Could you break down the reasons why inflation is fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes, or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year? Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we've always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive monetary policy, which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think that's broadly what we're seeing. So to go break it down a little further, of course, headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down mostly due to reversal of the effects from the war in Ukraine. And that's a good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier, for core inflation, I'd say there also, there has been a role for both factors, both that I mentioned. Clearly for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal of spending back into services and away from goods. And say take-out is an example, the combination of an increase in sales and imitories while vehicle inflation has decelerated points to a substantial role for supply. But there's also a role for demand as the loans and things like that are more expensive. So they're both working there. Housing services inflation now starts to move down. Clearly higher rates have slowed the housing market. I would say monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think it'll play an important role going forward in particular in non-housing services where really we think that's where the labor market will come in as a very important factor. So we think both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role. And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there more even split there too? I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we're sort of reaping now the benefits of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things. We're seeing that with goods in particular. Those supply chains and shortages moving. And we're seeing, so I think going forward monetary policy will be important particularly in the sector, in the non-housing services sector. Thank you, Chair. Well, first let me compliment your tie, the choice of tie. So thanks for taking our question. So the beige book, it said input cost pressures remain elevated for services firms, but he's notably for manufacturing sectors. That indication that there's a wage inflation pressure. And how do you target and pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into recession? I think as it relates to goods, it's really an indication that supply chains and shortages are easing. And so what was the first part of it? So wage inflation, how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into recession? I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that's what we're seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down. There's still at levels what would be consistent over a long period of time with 2% inflation, nonetheless, we're making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that. You can look at the quits rate normalizing. You can look at job openings coming down. You can look at just job creation in the establishment survey. It's still at a high level, but it was a really extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last report. So I think we see that. And it's happening in a gradual pace. So that's actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy. People are getting hired. Many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money, and that's really what's driving an economy. But that's gradually slowing. It's gradually cooling. That's a good prescription for getting where we want to get. But still we see push to raise minimum.",-0.0010515247108307,0.0019094440664574426

And the common thing is they come out with agreements like big pay increases, like UPS and we have the auto workers coming up. Are you concerned about a trend of series of big unions, these contract pushing wage inflation then? Not for us to comment on contract negotiations, not our job, not our role. You know, we monitor these things and we'll keep an eye on them. But really that's something that's handled at that level. And that's a large amount of people. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask about the SEP, which suggests that you would cut rates as overall on core PCE get to around or under 3%. And so I'm wondering, is the level of inflation what's sort of important there is you think about getting to 2% when you might start cutting rates or is the speed at which inflation is falling also important? I think you take both into account. I think you take everything into account when you start cutting rates. It would depend on the whole, on a wide range of things. And when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it's just as a sense that inflation is coming down and we're comfortable that it's coming down and it's time to start cutting rates. I think, but I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty between what happens when the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after that. So it's hard to say exactly what happens there, what's motivating people. So if it's sort of stubbornly and maybe the high-tos, you wouldn't necessarily cut rates. I'm not saying that at all. I'm not giving you any numerical guidance around that. I think we would, we'd be comfortable cutting rates when we're comfortable cutting rates. And that won't be this year, I don't think. And it would be, you know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year. I think the meeting was several for next year. And that's just going to be a judgment that we have to make then a full year from now. And it'll be about how confident we are that inflation is in fact coming down to our 2% goal. A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing and they've reduced their forecast for recession. And I'm wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of recession being likely. And if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident that you can achieve a soft landing. So one, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot in my base cases that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we've seen in some past. And so many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That's been my view that's still my view. And I think that's sort of consistent with what I see today. So it's a long way from a short and we have a lot left to go to see that happen. So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast. But given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession. I just want to note that our staff produces its own forecast, which is independent of the forecast that we as FOMC participants produce. And independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecast is a really a strength of our process. There's just a lot of I think constructive diversity of opinion that helps us make, it helps inform our deliberations, helps us make, I hope, better decisions. And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and you still have a strong labor market? I mean, is that add to the optimism? I wouldn't use the term optimism about this yet. I would say, though, that there's a pathway. And yes, that's a good way to think about it. We've seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And that's a really good thing. I would just also say the historical records suggest that there's very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions. And consistent with having a soft landing, you would have some softening in labor market conditions. And that's still likely as we go forward with this process. But it's a good thing. Today, we haven't really seen that. We've seen softening through either not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment. We've seen softening through job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels, the quits rate. And we've seen people not quitting as much. We've seen participation. People be...",-0.0004767439310541,0.0013828526274199822

So we're seeing that kind of cooling and that's very healthy. And we hope it continues. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Jeff Cox from Cmbc.com. You and other Fed officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2% that as long as you see continued progress. I'm wondering how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down? How many months of data do you need to see that will give you sufficient confidence? And how far does this fight need to go before you're willing to kind of declare victory on it? So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2% it would be a prescription of going way past the target. That's clearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So in effect, if you look at our forecasts, we, the median participant, and again, these are forecasting out here. So take them with a grain of salt, but people are cutting rates next year because the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now. So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, that we don't need to be at a restrictive level anymore. We can move back to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, of course, would be very careful about that we'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be, but that's the way I would think about it is, you'd start, you'd stop raising long before you, you got to 2% inflation and you'd start cutting before you got to 2% inflation too, because we don't see ourselves getting a 2% inflation until, you know, all the way back to two until 2025 or so. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Seanberger for the Agu Finance. It's been over four months since a handful of regional banks including Silicon Valley bank failed. When you look at credit conditions now, given Bank of California's acquisition of PAC West, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you comfortable saying that we've seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this point, and how does this play into your outlook for policy? So I didn't want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say things have settled down, for sure, out there, deposit flows of stabilized capital and liquidity remains strong, aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter, and has up significantly year-over-year banking sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter, and overall the banking system remains strong in resilient. Of course, we're still watching, you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in the banking sector. In terms of the actual effect on, if you think of a particular set of banks that were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more affected by the turmoil in March, then others, it's very hard, as I mentioned, it's very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening. They may be tightening a little bit more, probably, are than other banks. The sluice has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening. That process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth. So I think we have to take a step back from, I can't separate those anymore. I think basically we're just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions, and that's going to restrain economic activity, is restraining economic activity. So that's how I would look at it. And how is that informing your outlook for setting policy? So I think that goes, that is an expected result of tightening interest rate policy, is that bank credit conditions, would bank lending conditions, would tighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May? I just don't think we know that. I think we're looking at the current data in GDP, and we're seeing strong spending, we're seeing a strong economy, and it's made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. It seems like the economy is weathering this well, but of course we're watching it carefully, and expect it to continue to do that. Thank you.",-0.0040367697066759,0.004769566463159384
2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 19:10:00,2023-07-26 19:15:00," Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions, Megan Casale with Ference. I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we've been seeing. Well, wages in excess of inflation means real wages are positive. Again, that's a great thing. Of course, we want that. We want people to have real wages, but we want wages to be going up at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. As I mentioned, nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that's what we want to see. We expect to see more of that. That's just more of what's consistent over a longer period of time. We don't really think that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak, but I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor market conditions broadly are going to be an important part of getting inflation back down, and that's why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions. This goes sort of to the balancing risks question, but you mentioned at the start how you're keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there. I'm curious what the Fed's explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit. The labor market start to drive that sentiment back down. What's the message there of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them? Well, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control, and we think the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most important thing we can do now, and we're determined to do that. I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you're talking about travel or transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those, if you're just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you're in trouble right away. Even middle class people have some resources and can absorb inflation. People in the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that. So we need to get this done, and, you know, the record is clear that if we take too long or if we don't succeed that the pain will only be greater. So that's how I would explain what we're doing. Thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I mean, you could, was there doubt? Look, I would say there's a range of views on the committee, and when you see the minutes and three weeks you'll see that, there's a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should do at the next meeting. And it's a process that we go through. Many times when we go into a meeting, the decision is not, you know, fundamentally in doubt, nonetheless, we have the meeting. And some, some, some meetings are, you know, less uncertain than others. And I just leave it at that. Evan Reiser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell. Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks, the dollar, the stock market, et cetera. What does that mean for the Fed and being sure that inflation will come down to target? So we monitor, of course, financial conditions, broad financial conditions. You're right. It's the dollar and equities. And, you know, we're, of course, very focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will, we're going to use our policy tools to, working through financial conditions to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. And in principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more. But what tends to happen, though, is financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing. And ultimately, over time, we get where we need to go. If I could also ask about the SCP from June that showed rate cuts. Do you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year, will also continue in QT? So that could happen. The question is, you know, is that consistent with, with, so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it's a world where things are...",0.0004846241959644,0.0019176089400251373

Normalization in the case of the balance sheet would be to reduce QT. So to sort of continue it, you know, you're depending on where you are in the cycle. So there are two independent things and you know, really the active tool of monetary policy is rates. But you can imagine circumstances in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different ways, but that wouldn't be the case. Thanks Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a question about the discount window. I'm wondering if since the bank failures of the spring, if you've seen signs that banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that they're ready to use that facility if they need to. And if you have any sort of thoughts on whether policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to show that they are prepared to use it. Thanks. So that's a very important thing, yes. And yes to both sides of that, you know, yes banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window. And we are strongly encouraging them to do that. Thanks broadly. We did find, as you know, during the events of March and that, you know, that it's a little clunky or it can be a little clunky or not as quick as it needs to be sometimes. So why not be in a situation where you're just much more ready in case you need to access the discount window? Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bank Rate. You've talked in the past about getting the housing market back into better balance. Excuse me. Also that the market might have bottomed. Where do you see that situation and balance or lack thereof right now, particularly with the restraint, constraint inventory of existing homes that might otherwise be coming on to market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move. And of course, all of that happening with the 30 or fixed rate mortgage still around 7% on the heels of fed tightening and with what you're talking about tightening industry lending standards. Are we getting closer to balance or farther away? What's your sense? I think we've got a ways to go to get back to balance really for the reasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have low rate mortgages and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation they're not going to because they have such so much value in their mortgage, which means that supply of existing homes is really, really tight, just keeping prices up. On the other hand, there's a lot of supply coming online now and there are people coming in. A lot of the buyers are first time buyers coming in with these relatively elevated mortgage rates. But I think this will take some time to work through more, hopefully more supply comes online and we work through it. We're still living through the aftermath of the pandemic. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall Genser with Marketplace. Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grain, safe passage through Laxie and alternative routes at this point could be closed off. Just wondering how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally and how closely are you watching that? We are watching it, of course, very closely. And you're right, the withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative does raise concerns about global food security, particularly for poorer countries that import a lot of share of their food. Grained prices did go up on this news, but they remain well below their peaks of last spring. And the moves that we've seen so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation. Of course, we will be watching that situation carefully. So you don't think we'd have a big effect on Fed policy at this point? You wouldn't say so looking at what we know now. Thank you. Thanks very much.",-0.0005724602580474,0.0023600511712029495
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:35:00," Good afternoon, everyone. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We've raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We've covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we are in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particularly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat that would remain well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, or SEP, committee participants revised up their assessments of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1%. Participants expect growth to cool with the median projection falling to 1.5% next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless well below that scene earlier in the year. The unemployment rate ticked up in August, but remains low at 3.8%. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8% at the end of this year to 4.1% over the next two years. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Based on the consumer price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4% over the 12 months ending in August. In that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Nevertheless, the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2% has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3% this year, falls to 2.5% next year, and reaches 2% in 2026. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective.",0.0007456447567616,0.0034598163809867774
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:35:00,2023-09-20 18:40:00," As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 and a quarter percentage points. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 and a quarter to 5 and a half percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our security's holdings. We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely. The most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects at the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025. Compared with our June summary of economic projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year but has moved up by a half percentage point at the end of the next 2 years. These projections, of course, are not a committee's decision or plan if the economy does not evolve as projected the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary sub-policy affects economic activity and inflation, economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. What makes the committee inclined to think that the Fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year. There's noted uncertainty about policy lags. Headwinds have emerged from the looming government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments, things of that nature. I guess I would characterize the situation a little bit differently. We decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is at 5.25 and a half percent while continuing to reduce our security holdings. We say we're committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation at 2 percent over time. We said that. The fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean that we've decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we're seeking. If you looked at the SEP, as you obviously will have done, you'll see that majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates.",0.0007674416871886,0.002055057473860177
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:40:00,2023-09-20 18:45:00, more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already reached that. So it's something where we're by by we're not making a decision by by deciding to about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data. So right now it's still an open question about sufficiently restrictive you're not saying today that we've reached this level. We're not saying no. No clearly we are just what we decided it was maintain the policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level and then you know we're we're seeing progress and we welcome that but you know we need to see more progress before we'll be willing to to reach that conclusion. And just on the 2024 projections what's behind that shallow path for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher. Right so I would say it this way for first of all interest rates real interest rates are positive now they're meaningfully positive and that's a good thing we need a policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target okay and we need that we're going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think you know remember that the of course the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed really as a plan it's accumulation really and what you see are the medians. It's accumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people and then what you're seeing are the medians so I wouldn't want to you know bestow upon it the idea that it's really a plan but what it reflects though is that economic activity has been stronger than we expected stronger than I think everyone expected and and so what you're what you're seeing is this is what people believe as of now will be appropriate to achieve what we're looking to achieve which is progress toward our toward our inflation goal as you see in the SEP. Hi Chair Powell Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post thanks for taking our questions how would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding study is it discussion around lag times fear of too much slowing too little slowing could you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting. Yeah so the proposal at the meeting was to was to maintain our current policy stance and and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that but this of course is an SEP meeting and so people write down what they think and you've got you have some you saw I think seven wrote down no hike at this at this meeting or between now in the end of the year and I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the year so it wasn't like we were arguing over that people just stating their positions and really what what people are saying is let's see how the data come in you know we want to see you know we want to see we want to see that that this this these good inflation readings that we've been seeing for the last three months we want to see that it's more than just three months right we want to see you know the the labor market report that we received the last one that received was a good example of we do what we do want to see it was a combination of of you know of across a broad range of indicators continuing rebalancing of the labor market so those are the two things those are two mandate variables and and that's that's the progress that we want to see but I think people they want to be convinced you know they want to be careful to not to jump to a conclusion really one way or the other but just be convinced that the data you know support that conclusion and that's why given how far we've come and how quickly we've come we're actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting by meeting. And in your view what would I know nothing has been decided yet but what would one more hike at the end of the year due to the economy or to inflation on and on the other side what would no hike do if you could sort of game that out for us. So you know you can make the argument that one hike one where the other won't matter but for us we're trying we obviously as a group it's a pretty tight cluster of of where we think that that policy stance might be but we're always going to be learning from data you know we've learned all through the course of the last year that actually we needed to go further than we had thought if you go back a year and what we thought what we wrote down it's actually gotten higher and higher so we don't really know and until and that's why again we've grown up positioned to proceed carefully at this point a year ago we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up now now we're fairly close we think to where we need to get it's just a question of reaching the right stance I wouldn't attribute huge importance to one hike in macroeconomic terms nonetheless you know we need we need to get to a place where we're,-0.000586589657973,0.002056776060030795
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:45:00,2023-09-20 18:50:00," infinite that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2% over time. That's what we need to get to. And we've been moving toward it as we've gotten closer to it. We slowed the pace at which we've moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we're getting closer, again, we have the ability to proceed carefully. Okay, let's go to Steve. Steve Lee's been seeing it. He's been seeing it. He's seeing it. I want to return to Colby's question here. What is it saying about the committee's view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year, but need another half a point over the funds rate on it? Does it tell you that? Does it tell us that the committee believes inflation to be more persistent, requires more medicine effectively? I guess a related question is, if you're going to project a funds rate above the longer run rate for four years in a row, at what point do we start to think, hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher? Thank you. So I guess I would point more to, rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent. I wouldn't think that's not, we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data. It's more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So if I had to attribute one thing, again, we're picking a median here and trying to attribute one explanation, but I think broadly, stronger economic activity means rates. We have to do more with rates, and that's what that meaning is telling you. In terms of what the neutral rate can be, we know it by its works. We only know it by its works, really. We can't, you know, the models that we use, ultimately you only know when you get there, and by the way, the economy reacts on again. That's another reason why we're moving carefully now, because there are lags here. So it may, of course, be that the neutral rate has risen. You don't see the median moving, but you do see people raising their estimates of the neutral rate, and it's certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than the longer run rate. Remember what we write down in the SEP is the longer run rate. It is certainly possible that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than expected. Let's go ahead, Howard. Howard, Shady with Rodgers, thank you. So you've said several times that the economy needed a period of below trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2%. You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit. 1.5% is just a touch below what's the estimate of potential. So the fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works and change in how you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply, healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this? Yes, of course, it is a good thing that we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that's because we're seeing that rebalancing in other places, in, for example, job openings, and in the jobs worker gap. We've also seen supply side things. So that's happening. I would say, though, I still think, and I think broadly, people still think that we'll have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply as we've seen as well. Also, remember, the natural rate we think is coming down, which is a supply side thing, so that the gap between any given unemployment rate that's lower than that and the natural rate comes down, that's a way for supply, that's a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance. So all of those things are happening. You're right. In the median forecast, we don't see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase, but that really is just playing forward the trends that we've been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that's really what we've been seeing is progress without higher unemployment for now. So just to boil that down for a second, we've gone from a very narrow path to a soft landing to something different. Would you crawl to soft landing now, a baseline expectation? No, no. I would not do that. I would just say, what would I say about that? I've always thought that the soft landing was a plaza.",-0.002144421119162,0.002635776422810259
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:50:00,2023-09-20 18:55:00," outcome that there was a path really to a soft landing. I thought that and I've said that since we lifted off. It's also possible that the path is narrowed and it's widened, apparently, ultimately, this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day. But I do think it's possible. And I also think this is why we're a position to move carefully again. That we will restore price stability. We know that we have to do that. Then we know that public depends on us doing that. And we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is an extended period, sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We know that. The fact that we've come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying. So I think, you know, that's the end we're trying to achieve. I wouldn't want to handicap the likelihood of it, though. It's not up to me to do that. Nick. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, both you and Vice Chair Williams have indicated that sufficiently restrictive will be judged on a real rather than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year provided further compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside. Is the FOMC focused on targeting a real level of policy restriction? And can you explain what would constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive? I mean, yes, we understand that it's a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And again, I would say you know, you know sufficiently restrictive only when you see it. It's not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or in various estimates. And so what are we seeing? We're seeing, you know, through a combination of the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policies work in suppressing demand or alleviating very high demand. The combination of those two things is actually working. You're seeing, you know, inflation coming down. It's principally now in goods also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in non-housing services as well. So I think we think that that is working. And I think, well, you know, as we've said, we want to reach that, we want to reach something that we're confident, it gets us to that level. And I think confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, yes, okay, this feels like we can, we can for now decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here. We're not permanently deciding not to go higher, but we would, let's say if we get to that level. And then the question is how long do you stay at that level? And that's a whole other set of questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there. And we haven't, we haven't gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That's what, that's the stage we're at, though. It looks like there was because there wasn't across the board drop in the core PCE projection, core PCE inflation projection for this year. And even then it seems possible the core PCE inflation could come and even lower than the media and at 3.7%. Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation precedes somewhat better than you then you currently anticipate? The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and certainly at the last two meetings this year, it's going to depend on the totality of all the data. So the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the the the balance of risks and the other events that are happening out there. We'll make, we take all of that into account. So I can't really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It'll, it'll be trying to reach a judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that would increase our confidence that that yes, this is an appropriate movement. It will help help us be more confident that we've gotten to the level that we need to get to. Thanks, Chair Powell. Following up on next question actually, John Williams, the New York Fed president obviously, has said things to the effect of next year as we see inflation kind of again to next point as we see inflation coming down. We're going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we're not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time. And I wonder if that's basically the logic that you apply, you know, is that how you think about it. And then I also wonder in the last press conference, you see.",-0.0004976699995476,0.0020159920266382457
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:55:00,2023-09-20 19:00:00," said something to the effect of, you know, it's a full year out, those discussions and people interpreted that to mean that you didn't see a possibility of a rate cut in the first half of next year. And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you know, how you're thinking about that timing. No, when, so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about cutting, I'm never intending to send a signal about timing. I'm just answering them as the question is expressed. So, so please, I wouldn't want to be taken away. Sorry, the first question was, is that held? Yeah, so we're, as we go into next year, that's the question we'll be asking is, you know, taking into account lags and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy. The time will come at some point and I'm not saying when, that it's appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down. Part of it just may be that it'll be all the factors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point and what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead estimates of what that might be. And, you know, there's, you know, there's so much uncertainty around that. When we, in the moment, will do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this and say, hey, we made a plan. It's not like that at all. It's, these are estimates made a year advance that are highly uncertain and that's how it is. Neil. Thanks so much, Chip. How Neil Irwin with Axios, wonder how do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we've been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supply side factors, productivity, labor force growth. And, relatedly, if GDP keeps coming in hot, even in the absence of inflation, resurgence, would that on its own be a reason to consider more tightening? So, on your first question, I mean, we're looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what's the direction of it, what's driving it. And it's a lot of consumer spending, you know, it's been, the consumer's been very robust in spending. So, that is, you know, that's how we're looking at it. Sorry, your second question was, there's GDP stays hot, but without inflation. So, I think the question will be, GDP's not a mandate, right? Maximum employment and price stability of the mandates. The question will be, is GDP, is the heat that we see in GDP? Is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation? That's going to be the question. It's not a question about GDP on its own. It's, you know, you're expecting to see this improvement, you know, continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2% in a sustainable way. We have to have confidence in that. And, you know, we'd be looking at GDP just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Wida with Politico. There are multiple external factors that are playing out right now. We see rising oil prices, we see auto workers striking, where's the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering for each of those things, could you talk about how you're thinking about how that might affect the course for the Fed and the economy? So there is a long list and you hit some of them. But, you know, it's the strike, it's government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long-term rates, oil price shock, you know. There are a lot of things that you can look at. And, you know, so what we try to do is assess all of them and the handicap of them. And ultimately though, there's so much uncertainty around these things. I mean, to start with the strike. First of all, we absolutely don't comment on the strike as we have no view on the strike one way or the other. But we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the thing about it is so uncertain, it will depend, the economic effects, it could affect, you look, we've looked back at history, it could affect economic output, hiring and inflation. But that's really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it sustained for. And then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for loss production. So, none of those things are known right now. It's very, very hard to know. So, you just have to leave that uncertain and we'll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period. Much more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, I don't know if you mentioned shutdown. I think of all of these as being on the list. We don't comment on that. It hasn't traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect. You know, energy prices being higher, that is a significant thing. We, energy prices being up can affect spending, it can affect over time. A sustained period of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation. We tend to look through short-",-6.789788158603276e-05,0.002060781738303422

We have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well. Those are some of mine a much if I hit them all. But ultimately, you're coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum. And that's what we start with, but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. I was a little surprised, Chair Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy seeing added supply and a weight that could create long term inflation stability. We have primage labor force participation moving up where people can add skills. Workers want to work. We have a boom in manufacturing construction. We've had a decent spade of home building. And since inflation is coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity. All are which good for the feds longer run target of low inflation. And if we lose that in a recession, aren't we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into account as you pursue policy? Thank you. To begin, a soft landing is a primary objective and I did not say otherwise. I mean, that's what we've been trying to achieve for all this time. The real point though is the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability because the record is clear on that. If you don't restore price stability, inflation comes back and you go through what you can have a long period where the economy is just very uncertain and it will affect growth. It will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the fed coming in and having to tighten again and again. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability. I think now, today, we actually, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully and that's what we're planning to do. So we fully appreciate the benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing an important large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So. It's good, Chris. Hi. Thank you, Chris Ruege, Brad, Associated Press. When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling the low-hanging fruit, such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions or is it more of a broad, disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the economy? Thank you. So if I understood your question, it's, I would say it this way. I think we knew from the time, from before when we lifted off, it's certainly by the time we lit, we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going to help. It was going to help supply side heal by cooling demand off. And just in general, a lot better aligning supply with demand. So those two forces were always going to be important. I think it's very hard to pull them apart. They work together. I do think both of them are at work now. And I think they're at work in a way that shows you the progress that we are seeing. Michael McKeefer, Bloomberg Television Radio. In June, you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median Fed funds rate. And since then, you've more than doubled your growth forecast. You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So what would justify that last move because the median forecast is for lower inflation. And given all the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have or the American people have in your forecasts? Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult. Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to your question, though, what's happened is growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected. And that's required higher rates. Unemployment, you know, you also see that the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high. But that's really because of what we've been seeing in the labor market. We've seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment.",0.0002037120869171,0.0016306563391764515
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 19:05:00,2023-09-20 19:10:00," continuing that trend. In terms of inflation, you are seeing the last three readings are very, very good readings. It's only three readings. You know, we were well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look at June, July and August, you're looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the good sector also to some extent in housing services and just a little in non-housing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think people should know that economic forecasting is very difficult and these are highly uncertain forecasts. But these are our forecasts. You know, we have very high quality people working on these forecasts. And I think they stand up well against other forecasters, but just the nature of the businesses, the economy is very difficult to forecast. Given the forecast that you have, what justified not moving today and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in? Well, I think we have come very far, very fast in the rate increases that we've made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly and we did. And I think as we get closer to the rate that we think the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2% over time, you know, the risks become more to side it. And the risk of overtighting and the risk of under tightening that becomes more equal. And I think the natural common sense thing to do is as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it and that's what we're doing. So we're taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we sort of find our way to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2%. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Seanberger with Yahoo Finance. With your focus on your over your PCE, isn't it true that base effects are huge and that by the time you meet in November, that it's more likely that you'll have a low PCE number that would make you feel more comfortable? And secondly, how would the lack of key indicators like CPI, the jobs report impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to have a government shutdown? Thank you. Sorry. I missed the first question. What was it miss? What's factors? The base factors. Base factors. Okay. So on that, we're looking at just monthly, you can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior months. So you're right, when you go back three, six, and 12 months, you could base factors. But we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data, again, we don't comment on government shutdowns. It's possible. If there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the next meeting, then it's possible we wouldn't be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get. And we would just have to deal with that. And I don't know. It's hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don't know about now. But it's certainly a reality that's a possibility. What would you feel more comfortable on the base effects that as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, would you feel uncomfortable at that point? Yes. I mean, if you're looking, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And that's what we're looking at. And month by month, what's the reading? And I think what we're really looking at is, there's a tendency to look at shorter and shorter maturities, but they're incredibly volatile and they can be misleading. That's why we look at 12 months. But I think in this situation where it looks like we've had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June, we're also looking at six months and even three months, but really six months in inflation. So you're looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That's the right way to go. And we don't need to be in a hurry in getting to a conclusion about what to do. We can let the data evolve. So, thanks for the question. Chair Powell, Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We're seeing oil prices, as you mentioned, move up and that's pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not? Because the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we've seen the overall inflation is actually risen. Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer. This can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment. I mean, yeah.",-0.0011068866408672,0.00190796704853205
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 19:10:00,2023-09-20 19:15:00," prices are one of the big things that affects consumer sentiment. It really comes down to how persistent, how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn't, energy prices mostly, mostly don't contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don't tell you much about where inflation is really going. However, we're well aware, though, that, you know, if an energy price is the increase and stay high, that'll have an effect on spending. And it may have an effect on consumer expectations of inflation and things like that. That's just things we have to monitor. So, on the consumer, they're putting more and more of this on their credit card. The consumer seeing, you know, a record credit spending, how long do you think that consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned about a debt bubble related to that? So, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that's why we tend to look through energy moves that we can see as short-term volatility. You know, we're turning to consumer credit. You know, of course, we watch that carefully, consumer distress, measures of distress among consumers, where it historic lows quite recently, you know, after, during and after the pandemic, they're now moving back up to normal. We're watching that carefully. But at this point, these readings are not, they're not at troublingly high levels. They're just kind of moving back up to what was the typical in the pre-pandemic era. Hi, Jean Young with M&I Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve have risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed's view about what's been driving that increase in recent weeks? And how much of it can be attributed to macro-explanations and how much to technical factors? So, you're right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I think it's always hard to say precisely. But it's, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they'll, the view will be it's not, it's not mostly about inflation expectations. It's mostly about other things, you know, either term premium or real yields. And it's hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone's got models that will give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers. So, but essentially, they're moving up because it's not because of inflation. It's because probably it'll probably have something to do with stronger growth. I would say more more supply of treasuries, you know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense. Kyle Campbell, American banker, thank you for taking the questions. Just two on housing. You've said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed. But there's also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market. So my question is how much of the effort to tame inflation both as it's measured and felt by the broader public hinges on housing supply. And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future? So on the supply point, of course supply is very important over time in setting house prices and for that matter rents. And so supply is kind of structurally constrained. But in terms of where inflation is going in the near term though, as you obviously know, a lot of it is leases that are running off and then being resigned or released at a level that's not as high, it won't be that much higher. A year ago would have been much higher than it was a year before. Now it may be below or at the same level. So as those leases are rolling over, we're seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins. How much is that affecting things, really? The second effect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that bubble of buying and then a lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market. I think we look at the, I would look at the lock-in. The idea being that people are in very low-rate mortgages. And",-0.0015633142261594,0.0022015433499772367
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 19:15:00,2023-09-20 19:20:00," If they even if they want to move now, they would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive. And that's explaining some of the explanations for what's happening broadly in the labor market. Would that play a role in our future decisions in a future tight, in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I don't think it would. I mean, I don't think that's, I think we'd be looking at what fundamentally what rates does the economy need. And in an emergency like the pandemic or during the global financial crisis, you have to cut rates to the point that you have to do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn't think that that would be a reason for us. Not to do that. It's not something we're thinking about at all right now, but down the road, I wouldn't think so. Nancy. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, you've mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence, maybe cut back, consumer spending, possible government shutdown, high gas prices. At this point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending? Would that help you get inflation closer to you to present target? I wouldn't say it that way. We're not looking for a decrease in consumer spending. It's a good thing that the economy is strong. It's a good thing that the economy has been able to hold up under the tightening that we've done. It's a good thing that the labor market's strong. The only concern, it just means this, if the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we'll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2%. Because we will get back to 2%. Does that answer your question? Yeah, and I guess on the other hand, would you worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession? Well, that's always a concern. I mean, concern number one is restoring price stability. Because in the long run, that's something we have to do so that we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight labor market conditions that benefit all, as I've said a couple times. So that said, of course, we also now, given how far we've come with our rate hikes and how quickly we've come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of that consideration. Thank you, Chair Powell, Simon or Benavitch with the economist. One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of rate sensitivity than in the past. Obviously, we've talked about households with long fixed rate mortgages, also companies that refinanced before last year. What is your thinking about the efficacy of rates and how that's changed? And then related to that, how do you think about the distributional consequences in the sense that if you're a relatively wealthy household with a long fixed rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going that poor as if you're relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption. In fact, times are getting a lot tougher, a lot more quickly. Thanks. So what? I guess it's fair to say that the economy's been stronger than many expected, given what's been happening with interest rates. Why is that? Many candidate explanations, possibly a number of them make sense. One is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had understood. And so that that spending is held up and that kind of thing. We're not sure about that. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that's sustainable. That could be, you could just mean that the date of effect is later. It could also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is higher for various reasons. We don't know that. It could also just be that policy hasn't been restrictive enough for long enough. And there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in all this uncertainty, make policy. And I feel like what we have right now is what's still a very strong labor market, but that's coming back into balance. We were making progress on inflation. Growth is strong. But I think by many forecasts, many, many forecasts call for growth to moderate over the course of the next year. So that's where we are. And we have to deal with what comes. On your second question, which was, sorry, your second question was, distributional. But can you be a little clearer about that? My point there was that if you're somebody who has a long fixed rate mortgage, you've been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily. If you're somebody who's living a month to month off of your credit card, current.",-0.0005673050739765,0.0016809013265491756
2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 19:20:00,2023-09-20 19:23:35," financing rates are punitive? Yes, and so the point I would make there is that we're trying to get inflation back down. The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a fixed income. If you're a person who spends all of your income, you don't really have any meaningful savings. You spend all your income on the basics of life, clothing, food, transportation, heating, the basics. And prices go up by 5, 6, 7%. Your income will right away, whereas even middle class people have some savings and some ability to absorb that. So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability. And we want to do it as quickly as possible. Obviously, we would like to do that. We'd like the current trend to continue, which is that we're making progress without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that we've seen in past things. But you're right, though. When we raise rates, people who are living on credit cards and borrowing are going to feel that more. They are. And of course, people with lots of savings also have a much lower marginal propensity to consume. And so it's not going to affect them as much. Let's go to Greg Robb for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb for MarkaWatch. In the beige book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying non-profits and community groups about the economic health of low-income Americans, moderate groups of Americans. I have two questions about this. Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with a quarterly survey of those groups, like the senior loan officer survey? And also the second question is, from your recent readings of these surveys, how are low- and moderate Americans doing? Is there this thing where GDP is strong because of wealthy Americans driving things and just want to get your sense of the health of that sector? Thank you. So I don't know about the quarterly survey. That's an idea we can take away and think about. In terms of how low- and moderate Americans, they're clearly we're suffering from high inflation. I think during the pandemic, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And if you know the surveys that we take showed that low- and moderate income people were actually in very, very strong financial condition. I think now it's a very hot labor market. And you're seeing high nominal wages. And you're starting to see real wages are now positive by most measures. So I think overall households are in good shape. Surveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction. And I think a lot of that is just people hate inflation, hate it. And that causes people to say the economy is terrible. But at the same time, they're spending money. Their behavior is not exactly what you would expect from the surveys. That's kind of a guess at what the answer might be. But I think there's a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets. And certainly in the labor market and with wages, the biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low wage jobs. And now inflation coming down, you're seeing real wages, which is a good thing. Thanks very much.",0.0008174015712273,0.0011923823799951788
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:35:00," Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. The stance of policy is restrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending. After picking up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Employment remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12-month sending in September, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent. Inflation has moderated since the middle of last year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable. But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-ankored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided that today's meeting...",0.0023072165929308,0.0027353598782169667
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:35:00,2023-11-01 18:40:00," maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our security's holdings. We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor. Evidence of growth persistently above potential or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months driven by higher longer term bond yields among other factors. To us persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy. We monitor financial developments closely. In light of the uncertainties and risks and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook and for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Storing inflation is likely to require a period of below potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. It's going to Howard. Howard, Schneider with Reuters. Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this. To what you referenced the rise in long term ban yields, to what degree did that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting? Thanks for your question. So I'll talk about ban yields, but I want to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we're looking at that. So if you look at the situation, let's look at the economy first. Inflation has been coming down, but it's still running well above our 2% target. The labor market has been rebalancing, but it's still very tight by many measures. GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting and they have been forecasting that it will slow. As for the committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time, and we're not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance. So that is the broader context into which this, the strong economy and all the things I said, that's the context in which we're looking at this question of race. So obviously we're monitoring, we're attentive to the increase in longer term yields, and which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer. As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the past monetary policy. In this case, the tighter financial conditions we're seeing from higher long term rates, but also from other sources like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices could matter for future rate decisions as long as two conditions are satisfied. The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent, and that is something that remains to be seen. But that's critical. Things are fluctuating back and forth. That's not what we're looking for. With financial conditions, we're looking for persistent changes that are material. The second thing is that the longer term rates that have moved up, they can't simply be a reflection of expected policy moves from us, that we would then, that if we didn't follow through on them, then the rates would come back down. I would say on that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near term policy rates is causing the increase in longer term rates. In the meantime, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher treasury yields are showing through the higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic equity.",-0.0020645957426612,0.0038319647744853354
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:40:00,2023-11-01 18:45:00," to the extent this tightening persists. And the mind's eye goes to the 8%, near 8%, mortgage rate, which could have pretty significant effect on housing. So that's how I would answer your question. Just a quick follow-on to be clear on this. In your opening statement, and just now, you seem to apply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions are restrictive enough to finish the fight. Is that true? Yes, that's exactly right. To say it a different way, we haven't made any decisions about future meetings. We have not made a determination. And we're not confident at this time that we've reached such a stance. We're not confident that we haven't. We're not confident that we have. And that's the way we're going to be going into these future meetings is to be, you know, just determining the extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% at a time. So, I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to ask you a question. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I wonder, you know, if you don't raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be that, at that point, that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year? And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause? So, let me start by saying we haven't made a decision about September. You're asking a hypothetical there. But we're going into this several meetings. We'll get, as you know, two more inflation readings, two more labor market readings, some data on economic activity. And so we'll be taking, and also the broader situation, the broader financial condition situation, and broader world situation. We'll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December. We haven't made that decision. I would say, though, that the idea that if you have the idea that you wouldn't, would, would difficult to, to raise again after stopping for a meeting or two, it's just not right. I mean, the committee will always do what it, what it thinks is appropriate at the time. And again, we haven't made any decisions about, at all, about December. We didn't even, we didn't talk about making a decision in December today. Really, it was a decision for this meeting and, and understanding broader things. Nick. Nick. Nick Timeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell did the Fed staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today's meeting. And how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening is persistent? You had said it was worth maybe a quarter point when we had the bank failures in the spring. What is it here on something that's presumably more straightforward and more familiar to simulate? So I guess I don't want to answer your question about the, about the recession, but the answer is no. I think I have to answer it since we, since we did publicly saying the minutes, you'll, you'll know anyway in the minutes. The staff did not put our, our session back in. I mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that. If you look at the, look at the activity we've seen recently, which is not really indicative of, of a recession in the near term. In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it's, it's just too early to be doing that. And the main reason is we just don't know how persistent this will be. You can see how volatile it is. Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates. I think any kind of an estimate that was, you know, precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly. So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have, have clearly tightened. And you can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses that are paying now. And over time that will have an effect. We just don't know how persistent it's going to be. And it's tough to try to translate that, you know, way that I'd be comfortable communicating into how many rate hikes that is. The type of follow-up, I guess, what makes you confident that the tighter, what makes you confident that tighter financial conditions will slow above trend growth when 500 basis points of rate hikes, QT and a minor banking crisis have not thus far. Well, I just, that that's, you know, the way our policy works is, and sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable. But ultimately, if you raise the, you know, raise interest rates, you do see the if those effects. And you see those effects in the economy now. You see what's happening in the housing market. You're seeing that now. You'll see, if you look at surveys of people, it's not a good time. They think to buy durable goods of various kinds, because rates are so high now. I mentioned again, we're getting reports from housing that the effects of this, of this could be quite significant. But you're right, this has been a resilient economy. And it's, I think, been surprising in its resilience, and there are, there are a number of possible reasons why that may be. Our job is to, we stick,",-0.0018073291955006,0.0037219067614639553

So we just, we take it as it is. Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. In terms of the thresholds that you've laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence of persistently above trend growth, there's some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market tightness. That seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more quarter point rate hike would be necessary. And I'm just curious if that's how the committee sees it. So we've identified those factors. Those are not meant to be the only factors or a specific test that we're going to be applying with some metrics behind it. Really we're going to be looking at the broader picture. And you know what's happening with our progress toward the 2% inflation goal is the labor market continuing to broadly cool off and achieve a better balance. So we're looking at that growth. We look at growth in so far as it has implications for our two mandate goals. We look at that and we look at broader financial conditions. So we'll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you know, whether we need to further tighten policy. And if we do reach that judgment, then we will further tighten policy. Okay. And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if that is having some kind of offsetting effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates, what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts? Could we see those may be pulled forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated? So it's the fact is the committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all. We're not talking about rate cuts. We're still very focused on the first question, which is have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time sustainably? That is the question we're focusing on. The next question, as you know, will be for how long will we remain restrictive? Will policy remain restrictive? And what we said there is that we'll keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2%. That'll be the next question. But honestly, right now we're really tightly focused on the first question. The question of rates cuts just doesn't come up because I think the first question is so important to get that first question as close to right as you can. Steve Lee has been CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that there was a tightening bias in the committee. You say in the statement you're looking to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally. You didn't say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive. There were forecasts for two rate hikes among most members of the committee. But then you just said that we haven't made a determination. Would you say the bias right now is neutral that there is no disposition to hike again and that the committee largely has moved off of this forecast for two hikes? I think you said that one additional. I wouldn't say that at all. I would say the language looking at it here in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation 2% over time. That's the question we're asking. So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the committee here? We haven't used that term, but it's fair to say that's the question we're asking is should we hike more? It's not. You know, and that is the question on your right that in September we wrote down one additional rate hike, but you know, we'll write down another forecast as you know in December. Chris. Thank you, Chris Ruegayver and Associated Press. Well since the last meeting the auto workers strike has finished oil prices have leveled off. And yet on the other hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas. How do you see all those factors taking together affecting the economy going forward? How are you thinking about those? So there are significant issues out there. As you point out, global geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated and that goes for the war and your chronic goes for the war between Israel and Hamas. We're monitoring that.

It is sufficiently restrictive. That's really our focus. Great. And just one quick thing. You last month had gone to York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of, or yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot of small business owners. Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you picked up on? And what was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about? I wouldn't say I was terribly surprised. I was very impressed by York as a town with a real strategy. And I would say it's very impressive what the people there have put together in the face of some difficult longer run trends about offshoreing of manufacturing and that kind of thing. They've done a great job as a city, I think. What you hear is consistent there, which is people are really suffering under high inflation. You were there. We talked to some people who were feeling that in their businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well. It's painful for people, particularly people who don't have a lot of extra financial resources who are spending most of their incoming income on the essentials of life. So we know that. That wasn't new, but that did come through very clearly in the conversations we had in New York. I walked away from that and even just thinking that we really, the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore a fully restored price stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage we can. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You've spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get inflation down, but since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, how have you changed your views on that at all on how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall growth? Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we've been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one. So that's historically unusual and very welcome result. And the same is true of growth. We've been saying that we need to see below potential growth. And growth has been strong, but yet we're still seeing this. I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part, I think still believe that it is likely to be true. It is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market conditions to get to fully restore price stability. So, but it's only a good thing that we haven't seen. And I think we know why. Since we lifted off, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here, one of which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic. And the other is restrictive monetary policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover, time and space to recover. So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation. But it's that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth. It's just supply, supply side improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away. It's getting a significant increase in the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration. That's a big supply side gain that is really helping the economy. It's part of why GDP is so high, because we're getting that supply. So we welcome that. But I think those things will run their course and we're probably still going to be left, we think, and I think we'll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability. And that's where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important. Against that backdrop, if you've gotten any clarity on lags, if you have an economy that's been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that there isn't necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and that it may have already come into effect? You know, I continue to think it's very hard to say. So it's been one year at this meeting, one year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points, heikes.",0.0011196874404422,0.0021445421402530016
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:55:00,2023-11-01 19:00:00," That's a full year since then. I think we are seeing the effects of all the hiking we did last year and this year we're seeing it. It's very hard to know exactly what that might be. But you can, for example, an example of where you wouldn't have felt this yet is debt that had been termed out. But it's going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after. So, and there are little things like that where the effects are just taking time to get into the economy. So, I don't, I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the legs are. I think trying to make a clear, clear answer and say, I'm just going to assume this is a really not a good way to do it. And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy. And it takes time. We know that. And you can't rush it. So, doing slowing down is giving us, I think, a better sense of how much more we need to do if we need to do more. Michael. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I'm trying to connect the dots here. One quick clarification I want to ask about Rachel's question is you said you need slower growth. You had always said before a period of lower than trend growth has that changed. And two, it sounds to me like you're basically saying here that the kind of the dot plots out the window that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase for right now doesn't matter about the turn of the year. And that there's not an objective way to determine whether or not you've got enough tightening in the system. It's just going to be a subjective judgment meeting by meeting. Well, so let's talk about the dot plot first. So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the committee thinks is likely to be a appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast. In principle, when things change, that's not like a plan that anybody's agreed to or that we will do. That's a forecast that would change, for example. I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say I wouldn't write down that dot six weeks later. I think of the number of things that could change your mind on that. So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three months period between that meeting and the next meeting. But nonetheless, it's out there and we don't. We do personally update our forecast, but we don't formally update the dot plot. So I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we're thinking about these things. We're laying out there, our thinking, and as we approach the meeting, my colleagues and I will be talking about how we're processing that data. In terms of, so we're not really changing the way, in terms of growth, what I said was below potential. So what you have here recently is growth that is temporarily, potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level. So the right way to think about it is what's potential growth issue. People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2%, or I would say just around 2%. But what we've had is with the improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, through both participation and immigration. And with the better functioning in the labor market and with unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things, you're seeing actually elevated potential growth. There's catch up growth that can happen in potential. And that means that if you're growing, you could be growing at 2% this year and still be growing, growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy. I hope that's clear. That's really what's going on. That's why I would say it as below potential. But if you could clarify what I asked about meeting by meeting, we essentially now supposed to assume that it's a meeting by meeting, live meeting with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at each meeting. I don't know that I want to just accept anybody's characterization. I'll tell you how we're doing this. So we're going meeting by meeting. We're asking ourselves whether we've achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time. That's the question we're asking. We're looking at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we look at. And then we've come very far with this rate hiking cycle, very far. And you saw the spread at the September meeting of, you know, it's a relatively small spread of people think one or two additional hikes. So you're close to the end of the cycle.",0.0026515800494955,0.0034030603745746337
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 19:00:00,2023-11-01 19:05:00," That was an impression as of a belief, as of September. It's not a promise or a plan of the future. And so we're going into these meetings one by one. We're looking at the data. As I mentioned, we're also, you know, we're being careful. We're proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time. Monetary policy is restrictive. We see its effects, particularly in interest sensitive spending and other channels. So that's how I think about it. Neil. Thanks. I Chair Powell, Neil Irwin with Axios. In light of the run-up in long-term yields, we've seen the last several weeks. Have you given any consideration to the pace of your asset run-off program? And if there were a judgment that the higher term premium was endangering the dual mandate goals, would that be a reason to think about slowing or suspending QT? Or should we think of that as more of a technical question around reserves? So committee is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff. It's not something we're talking about. We're considering. And I know there are many candidate explanations for why rates have been going up. And QT is certainly on that list. It may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it's not, I think it's hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point. So that's not something that we're looking at right now. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask about the Basel III endgame capital proposal. You've gotten a lot of pushback from people on different aspects of the proposal and you yourself expressed some reservations. And I'm just curious, could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes? So that proposal is out for comment. And we expect a lot of comment. We won't get those comments until the end of, or to well into next year. We've extended the deadline. And we'll take them seriously. We'll read them. I'll say what I do expect is that we will come to, we're a consensus driven organization. We'll come to a package that has broad support on the board. So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had? It means broad support. So, Janelle Marte with Bloomberg. So, in addition to persistence, when you look at long-term treasury yields, what also you're watching to evaluate how those tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy, and if it will lessen the need for further tightening, also do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress? So, what do we look at? We look at a very wide range of financial conditions. And in fact, as you'll know, different organizations publish different financial conditions indexes, which can have seven or eight variables, so they can have 100 variables. So, there's a very rich environment. And we tend to look at a few of them. I'm not gonna give you the names, but there are a few of the common ones that people look at. And so, they're looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates, the credit spreads, sometimes they're pulling in credit availability and things like that. So, it isn't any one thing. We would never look at, for example, long-term treasury rates in isolation. Nor will we ignore them. But we would look at them as part of a broader picture, and they do play a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial conditions indexes. Your second question was... On the banking stress. Banking stress. So, it's something we're watching. As you know, we did have, there were issues with interest rate risk, and also funding, uninsured deposits in the March, the things we went through in March and thereafter. And so, we've been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and that they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio unrealized losses that they have. We do think the banking system is quite resilient. We had a handful of bank failures, but so that's what we're out there doing. And we don't have any reason to think that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong banking system and one where there's a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity, on funding, and those sorts of things.

Yeah, so you're right. We put a proposal out for comment is what we did. And you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us as you of course know in Dodd-Frank and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute. That's all we're trying to do. What else can we really do? It's a 90 day comment period. We typically don't comment on these things once they're out for comment and we do hope that stakeholders and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views. They haven't been shy about that. So that's critical and that's what I can say about that now. Thank you. Thanks, Chair. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So over the last three months, the year over year, PC inflation was at 3.4% core, well over 3%. You've said in the past 2% remains the Federal Reserve target but with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3% or 3% plus overall inflation? You know, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy but we're making progress. I think the core PCE came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter. So the best thing I could point to you too would be the September SEP where you know, the expectation was that inflation by the end of next year on a 12-month trailing basis would be well into the twos and the year after that further into the twos. So that's, if you look historically, that's sort of consistent with the way inflation comes in. It does take some time and as you get further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time. But the good news is we're making progress and monetary policy is restrictive and we feel like we're on a path to make more progress and it's essential that we do. But you said in the past that doing too little on interest rates could take years to fix but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed. How robust was the debate about this pause on the doing too little side? That's always the question we're asking ourselves and we know that if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy and we know that that's really bad for people. Inflation will be both higher and more volatile. That's a prescription for misery and so we're really committed to not letting that happen. For the first year or so of our tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough. We've come far enough that the risks have gotten more to side. You can't identify that with a lot of precision but it does feel like the risks are more to side it now. We're committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time and we will. Simon. Simon or Benavitch with the Economist. Quick follow up to the question about banking stresses. We talked about how the banking system is resilient. Of course part of the resilience of the past year stems from the bank term funding program that you launched in March. Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are probably mounting. How likely is it that you might have to extend that program in March next year? Good question. We haven't really been thinking about that yet. It's November 1 and that's a decision we'll be making in the first quarter of next year. Quick step question about inflation expectations. The U.S. Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one year ahead inflation expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2. Last year you said that particular survey was a really decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions. If it stays elevated next time around, how big of an input will that be into your December thinking? We look at a range of things. I think the U.M. thing got blown out of proportion a little bit. It was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away. I said it was preliminary in that but that didn't get picked up. We look at many, many things. Look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates. We do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings. It's just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place. The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2% over time and it will. They're right. There's no real crack in that armor. You can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack. But honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the public believes that inflation will...",0.0006394013309021,0.0015876777251185212

Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate. You mentioned today that you're still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive and you've recently said that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now. So it's curious if you could elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate in your view has risen. Yeah. So first thing to say is that it's very important. It's a very important variable in the way we think about monetary policy but you can't identify it with any precision in real time and we know that. So you have to just take that. You have to take your estimate with a grain of salt. What we know now is within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy is restrictive and that's therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring and inflation. So we do talk about this. There's not any debate or attempt to agree as a group on whether our star is moving or not. Some people think it's going to be a big deal. Some people haven't said that don't think it has. Ultimately it's unknowable and so really again what we're focused on is looking at the data and giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our moves. Does it feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2% over time? That's the question we're asking ourselves. I think years from now economists will be revising their estimates of our star as it existed on November 1, 2023. We can't really wait for that in making policy. We have to have those models and look at them and think about them and ultimately we've got to look at the effects of policies having, accounting for the lags which makes it difficult. If I could follow up on a wages point earlier, you talked about the inflation outlook but I'm curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its current level could risk pushing up overall inflation or re-acceleration. If you look at the broad range of wages, wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they're substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2% inflation over time making standard assumptions about productivity over time. It's much closer than it was. That's true of the ECI which is the one that we got this week. It's true of avigerally earnings and compensation per hour too. All of them are saying that which is great. You have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be a deocene critic in any given reading. That's what you see. What you saw with the ECI reading was if you look back a couple of, comes out four times a year, if you look back a couple of quarters you'll see it was much higher and then it came down substantially in June. And then September reading was more or less at the same level as the June reading. So in a way, it's just validating that decline. And it was very close to our expectations internally too. So I think we feel good about that. Also, I would say it isn't in my thinking. It's not the case that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far. Although I think it's fair to say that as we go forward as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply side issues I talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects, it may be that the labor market has become more important over time too. Nancy. Hi Nancy Marshall Gensur with Marketplace. Chair Paul, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you are about getting inflation down to the 2% target? So as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half the concern was not doing too much too not doing enough. It was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations higher inflation expectations become entrenched. So that was the concern. I think we've reached you know now more than 18 months into this. You can see by the fact that we have slowed down although we're still we're still we're trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate stance is but you can see that we think and I think that the risks are getting more balanced. I'll just say that they're getting more balanced.",-0.0006626748396562,0.002060732389028387
2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 19:15:00,2023-11-01 19:20:00," doing too much versus the risk of doing too little or getting closer to balance. Because policy is, I think clearly restrictive at 5 and a quarter to 5 and a half percent that range. If you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you're going to see a real policy rate that is well above mainstream estimates of a neutral policy rate. Now that's a risk-met-tick, it doesn't really. The proof is really in how the economy reacts. But I would say that we're in a place where those risks are getting closer to being in balance. And you said the proof is how the economy reacts. What are you looking at to be sure you're not overshooting? Well, I think what we're looking at is inflation is still broadly cooling. Is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer where inflation was clearly cooling and coming down? Now we've seen periods like that before and there hasn't been followed through the data have bounced back. So what are we seeing? Are we seeing inflation still coming down? That's the first thing. Second thing is in the labor market, what we've seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and demand partly through just much more supply coming online. And with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong when you have the kind of job growth we've had over the last quarter, it's still very strong demand. And you see wage increases coming down as we discussed, but coming down in a kind of gradual way, I think we want to see that whole set of processes continue. Thank you. All right, Madam Sienna. Do you think that there has been any structural change in either consumption or in the job market that's pushing a consumption? You also saw the third quarter GDP figures which were strong and some economists have expected everyone spending to have fizzled out by now. So I'm kind of wondering if there's been any structural change in consumption. I wouldn't say there's been a structural change in consumption. I would say it's certainly been strong. And so a couple of things, we may have underestimated the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses and that may be part of it. There may be, you know, we've been like everyone else trying to estimate the number of the amount of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn't spend on services really at all or in person services. And you know, there can still be more of that than we think, although at a certain point, we're going to be getting back to pre-pandemic levels of savings. We may not be there yet. So things are for clearly people are still spending. The dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are higher than inflation in the aggregate anyway. And that raises real disposable income and that raises spending which continues to drive more hiring. And so you've had a really, that whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off so that goods availability, automobile availability is better or was better. I think it still is. And from a business standpoint, there are more people to hire. And it's more labor supply. So the whole thing is led to more growth, more spending and that kind of thing. And it's been good. And the thing is we've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this. So it's been a dynamic. The question is how long can that continue? And I just think this, the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the pandemic effects, that's what makes this cycle unique, I think. And we're still learning. That took longer for that process to begin than we thought. And we're still learning about how it plays out. That's all we can do. So Dan, you're on the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell. Daniel Avis from Agents from Homes Press. Just a quick question following up on an earlier one. It occurs to the Israel Hamas conflict. The Fed's financial stability report said that Israel Hamas conflict in the conflict in Ukraine posed important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained disruptions to regional trade and food, energy and other commodities. He had organizations at the World Bank warning of a possible surge in oil prices if the war.",0.0005683567385796,0.001468637483418485

I'm just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments in the Middle East, you mentioned they are, and just what, you know, the potential economic impact could be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region. Thank you. I wouldn't want to speculate too much, but I'll just say so. You know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely, and does it start to do things like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we're talking about? The price of oil has really not reacted very much so far to this. As the Fed, as the Federal Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about, to understand the economy and economic effects, and it isn't clear at this point that the conflict in the Middle East is going to, is on track to have significant economic effects. That doesn't mean it isn't incredibly important, and something for people to, you know, to take, take really important notice of, but it may or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an economic body. But the, what the Financial Stability Report does is it calls out risks, and that's what it's doing is calling out a risk of that. And the war in Ukraine is the same. The war in Ukraine, you know, did have immediately very significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities. So thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much.",0.0016568047337277,0.001917659035488535
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As we approach the end of the year, it's natural to look back on the progress that has been made toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress and bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that were fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Distoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We've raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt. Today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that we face, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 2.5% for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. After picking somewhat up over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year, but expect growth to cool with a median projection falling to 1.4% next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand condition is continued to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. An employment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth appears to be easing and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8% at the end of this year to 4.1% at the end of next year. Employment has eased over the past year, but remains above our longer-run goal of 2%. Based on the consumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in November, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1%. The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2% will take.",0.0001087940023266,0.00033396175599240016
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:35:00,2023-12-13 18:40:00," some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8% this year, falls to 2.4% next year, and reaches 2% in 2026. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than a trillion dollars. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We're committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation standably down to 2% over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6% at the end of 2024, 3.6% at the end of 2025, and 2.9% at the end of 2026 still above the median longer term rate. These projections are not a committee decision or plan. If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. In light of the uncertainties and risks and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy affirming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumul of tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping long-return inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Chris Regaber, Associate of Press. I wanted to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word any before additional affirming in the statement? Does that mean that you're pretty much done with rate hikes and the committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and total more neutral stance? Thank you. So specifically on any, we do say that in determining the extent of any additional policy affirming that may be appropriate, so any additional policy affirming that sentence. So we added the word any as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn't write down additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that's where we wrote down. But participants also didn't want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table, so that's really what we were thinking.",7.539285060361276e-05,0.00020465757556178998
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:40:00,2023-12-13 18:45:00," Oh, my phone's ringing. Steve Leesman, CNBC. Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman. The Fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several months could be cutting interest rates. I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with the Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn't cut rates if inflation fell. Thank you, sir. So, of course, I don't comment on any other officials, even those who work at the Fed. But I'll try to answer your question more broadly. So the way we're looking at it is really this. When we started out, we said the first question is how fast to move and we move very fast. The second question is, you know, really how high to raise the policy rate. And that's really the question that we're still on here. We're very focused on that. As I mentioned, people generally think that we're at or near that. And think it's not likely that we will hike, although they don't take that possibility off the table. So that's when you get to that question and that's your answer, there's a natural, naturally it begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraints in place. So that's really the next question. And that's what people are thinking about and talking about. And I would just say this, we are seeing strong growth that appears to be moderating. We're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures. And we're seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we've been wanting to see. We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature. And we can't be guaranteed to this progress. So we're moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. And that's really the question that we're on. But of course, the other question, the question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraints in place that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion, topic of discussion now in the world. And also a discussion for us at our meeting today. Can you give some color to the nature of that discussion today? Thank you. Sure. So it comes up in this way today. Everybody wrote down an SCP forecast. So many people mentioned what their rate forecast was. And there was no back and forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement. Like this is what I wrote down. This is what I think, that kind of thing. And preliminary kind of a discussion like that. Not everybody did that, but many people did. And then, I would say there's a general expectation that this will be a topic for us looking ahead. That's really what happened in today's meeting. I can't do the head count for you in real time, but that's generally what happened today. Good, Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a recession and isn't heading for one now? And if the answer is no, I'm curious about what you'd still be looking for. I think you can say that there's little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now. I would say that. I think there's always a probability that there will be a recession in the next year. It's a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it's always a real possibility. So the question is, is it, so it's a possibility here. I have always felt since the beginning that there was a possibility because of the unusual situation that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that's what we're seeing, that's what many forecasters on and off the committee are seeing. This result is not guaranteed. It is far too early to declare victory. And there are certainly risks. It's certainly possible that the economy will behave in an unexpected way. It has done that repeatedly through the post pandemic period. Nonetheless, where we are is we see the things that I mentioned. I'm curious if you're looking back on the past year, you talked about navigating by the stars under cloudy skies. Can you talk about some of the ways in which the economy surprised you most this year, where you thought it would behave in one way and had to pivot to respond? Thanks. So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very broadly forecasting a recession for this year for 2023. And not only did it.",-1.0769363315231009e-05,0.0003123754537522363
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:45:00,2023-12-13 18:50:00," that not happen. That includes Fed Forecasters and really essentially all Forecasters. A very high proportion of Forecasters, very weak growth or a recession. Not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year. And that was a combination of strong demand, but also, but real gains on the supply side. So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic, you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks really began to unwind. So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand. And we got what looks like a two and a half percent plus or a little more than that growth year. At a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that just because of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody. I think the inflation forecast is roughly, roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but in a very different setting. And I would say the labor market because of the stronger growth has also been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in unemployment. It didn't really happen. We're still at 3.7%. So we've seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market, but one that's coming back into balance with the support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It's a, you know, that's what we see in that. I think that combination was not anticipated broadly. Thanks Howard Schneider with orders and thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what motivates the lower rates next year. Whether it's a coincidence, for example, that the spread between PC inflation, core inflation and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year. Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices and the price level that you're expecting in the rate of inflation that you're expecting as opposed to supporting the economy? Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is a bottom's up built from the bottom up, right? So I think people are looking at what's happening in the economy. And I think look at the big difference from September in the SEP, the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core have come down, you know, really significantly in three months. That's a big piece of this. At the same time, growth is, turn it to be very strong in the third quarter, is slowing we believe as appropriate. And we've got, we've had several labor market reports which suggest, again, significant progress toward greater balance across a very a broad range of indicators. You're seeing that so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them. But so I think that people look at that and they write down their, they're basically each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and publish it. And so it's not. It isn't, you ask about real rates, I take it. You know, that is, that is something that we're very conscious of and aware of and monitor. And it's certainly a big part of, it's a part of how we think about things, but really it's broader financial conditions that matter. And as you well know, it's so hard to know exactly, you know, what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time. So you couldn't follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time. But it's certainly something that we're focused on. And indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we move forward. It sounds like the discussion over that I could follow up has already kind of begun. I'm wondering, just related to Steve's question, how the tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024, the closer you get to a presidential election. Do you want to front-load this? In other words, yeah, no, we don't think about political events. We don't think about politics. We think about what's the right thing to do for the economy. The minute we start thinking about those things, we just can't do that. We have to think, what's the right thing? We'll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time when we think is the right time. That's what we'll always do. So I mentioned we're moving carefully. One of the things we're moving carefully about is that decision over that assessment really, over whether we've done enough really. And you see that people are not writing down. Rate hikes, that's us thinking that we have done enough, but not feeling that really strongly confidently and not wanting to take the possibility of a rate hike off the table. In nonetheless, it's not the base case anymore, obviously, as it was 60, 90 days ago. So that's how we're approaching things. And as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP and it talks about people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate.",0.0001938506273222,0.0002800094772438354
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:50:00,2023-12-13 18:55:00," to start to dial back on the tight policy we have in place. And that's a discussion we'll be having going forward, but that's another assessment that we're going to make very carefully. So as time goes forward. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you've argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf. The market is now easing policy on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that's a full point below the current level with cuts beginning around March. Is this something that you are broadly comfortable with? So this last year has been remarkable for the sort of sea saw thing back and forth we've had over the course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing. So what I would just say is that we focus on what we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals. And that's what we really focus on. And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy. And those are going to show up in market conditions or they won't. But in any case, we have to do what we think is right. And in the long run, it's important that financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with what we're trying to accomplish. And in the long run, they will be, of course, because we will do what it takes to get to our goals. And ultimately, that will mean that financial conditions will come along. But in the meantime, there can be back and forth. And I'm just focused on what's the right thing for us to do. And my colleagues are focused on that too. The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly. Do you believe we're at the point where inflation is coming down credibly? I believe so. And I welcome the progress. I think it's really good to see the progress that we're making. I think if you look at the 12-month measure, look at the six-month measures you see very low numbers. If you look at 12-month measures, you're still well above 2%. You're actually above 3% on core through November at PCE. But to say, calling into question the progress, it's great. We just need to see more. We need to see continued further progress toward getting back to 2%. That's what we need to see. So it's our job to restore price stability. And it's one of our two jobs along with maximum employment and they're equal. So we're very focused on doing that. As I mentioned, we're moving carefully at this point. We're pleased with the progress. But we see the need for further progress. And I think it's fair to say there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward. We've seen the economy move in surprising directions. So we're just going to need to see more for the progress. Gina Smiley, New York Times, thanks for taking our questions. In the SCP from today, growth is notably below potential in 2024. If growth were to surprise us again, in the way that it has for years now, by being stronger than expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates or put another way is below trend growth necessary to cut rates or would continue progress on inflation alone, be sufficient? So we'll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing. So is inflation. So is labor market data. So we look at the totals. We make decisions about policy changes going forward. We're going to look at all those things. And particularly about the as they affect the outlook. So it's ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risks as well. So that's what we be looking for. If we have stronger growth, that'll be good for people. That'll be good for the labor market. It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2%. We will get it down to 2%. But if we see stronger growth, we will set policy, according to what we actually see. And so that's how I would answer. I guess the question I'm asking, if you don't mind a quick follow-up, I guess the question I'm asking is, is above trend growth itself a problem? It's only a problem. It's not itself a problem. It's only a problem in so far as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And if you have growth that's robust, what that will mean is probably we'll keep the labor market very strong. It probably will place some upward pressure on inflation. That could mean that it takes longer to get to 2% inflation. That could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer. It could even mean, ultimately, that we would need to hike again. It's just the way our policy works.",0.0003768627788784,0.0005106282170008359
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 18:55:00,2023-12-13 19:00:00," How do you interpret the state of the labor market right now and in particular you've referred even today to evidence that it's coming into better balance? What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance? So on the better balance side, just a lot of things. You see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels given population growth and labor force participation. The things that are not quite, but let me go on with that list. Claims are low. If you look at surveys of businesses, they're sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage or behind us and they're seeing a shortage of labor is being significantly alleviated. Look at shortages of workers, whereas they thought job availability, job availability was the highest that it had ever been or close to it. That's down to more normal levels by so many measures, participation, unemployment, so many measures, the unemployment, job openings, quits, all of those things. So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2% inflation over a long period of time. They've been gradually cooling off, but if wages are running around 4%, that's still a bit above, I would say. And I guess they're just a couple of other, the unemployment rate is very, very low. And these are, but I would just say overall the development of the labor market has been very positive. It's been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases. Hi, Jones, financial times. I'd say the mood among economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat corroborated by your forecast by this sense that we are going to have a soft landing. Yeah, when we hear from the general public, there's a lot of discord about economic conditions. What do you think explains this disconnect and does it matter for policymakers? It may be a common theme is that while inflation is coming down and that's very good news, the price level is not coming down. The prices of some goods and services are coming down, but overall in the aggregate, the price level is not good. So people are still living with high prices. And that's not, that is something that people don't like. And what's, what will happen with that is wages are now, real wages are now positive. So wages are now moving up more than inflation as inflation comes down. And so that might help improve the mood of people. But we do see those public opinion surveys. The thing that we can do is to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits over such long periods of time, which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for families and companies around the country. Hi, Victoria Aguido with Politico. I wanted to ask, on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start to see unemployment rise. That sort of the levels of inflation that we're seeing now, how would you all think about that in terms of rate cuts? Would that be a sign that you've done your job demand wise? Sorry, if, if the economy starts to looks like it's starting to fall into recession, if the jobless rate starts to rise. That's not something we're hoping to see. Obviously, we're hoping to see something very different, which is continuation of what we have seen, which is. The labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment, inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating without a significant increase in unemployment. That's what we're trying very much to achieve, and not something we're looking to see. Would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates? Obviously, what we'll do is we'll look at the totality of the data, as I've mentioned a couple of times, and certainly the labor data would be important in that. If you can describe a situation like that, if there were the beginning of a recession or something like that, then yes, that would certainly weigh heavily in that decision.",-0.0002367984844896,0.0007106555258850548
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 19:00:00,2023-12-13 19:05:00," Thank you. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television Radio. Mr. Chairman, you were by your own admission behind the curve in starting raise rates to fight inflation. And you said earlier, again, the full effects of our tightening cycle have not yet been felt. How will you decide when to cut rates and how will you ensure you're not behind the curve there? So we're aware of the risk that we would hang on too long. We know that that's a risk and we're very focused on not making that mistake. And we do regard the two, we've come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it. Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the price stability mandate and we're getting back to the point where, which is what you do when you're very far from one of the two mandates, you're getting now back to the point where both mandates are important and they're more in balance too. So I think we'll be very much keeping that in mind as we make policy going forward. And the things we'll be looking at, I've already described, we're obviously looking hard at what's happening with demand. And what we see, we see the same thing, other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year. And you see what the forecast are. I think the median growth, median participant wrote down 1.4% growth, but you know, we'll have to see. It's very hard to predict. We'll also be looking to see progress on inflation and the labor market remaining strong, but ideally without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes. When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates where you basically do trial and error cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress? We haven't typically tried to articulate with one exception, a really specific target levels, which was if you, some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in, I guess, 2013. The answer is, these are things that we haven't, you know, really worked out yet. We're sort of just at the beginning of that discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence, the Fox Business. So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is showing about 75 basis points, does that signal that there's a belief of weakness next year in the economy? Well, first of all, let me just say that isn't a plan. That's just accumulating what people wrote down. So that's not something you know this, but allow me to say it again. We don't debate or discuss what the right, you know, whose SEP is right. We just say what they are and we tabulate them and publish them. So it's important for people to know that, but it wouldn't need to be a sign of, it could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing and doesn't need the tight policy. It depends on the economy can evolve in many different ways, right? So, but it could be more what I just described. And you focused on core inflation. We've heard from in other meetings how sticky is core inflation right now? Well, that's what we're finding out. And we've, you know, we've seen real progress in core inflation. It has been sticky and famously the service sector is thought to be sticky or, but we've actually seen reasonable progress in non-housing services, which was the area where you would expect to see less progress. We are seeing some progress there though. In fact, all three of the categories of core are now contributing goods, housing services, non-housing services. They're all contributing in different, at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting or rather report by report. So, yeah. Okay, let's go to Katarina. Katarina, sir, I have a Bloomberg news. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this, you know, this morning and yesterday. I'm assuming those were not incorporated into the forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, you know, on the inflation outlook. Right. So we got, we got CPI the morning of the first day and we got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE. So it's very, very late in the game, you know, to, to, but nonetheless, participants are allowed to encourage to up.",0.0050175506600339,0.00501755066003399
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 19:05:00,2023-12-13 19:10:00," date their SEP forecast until probably mid-morning today. After that, so staff has to accumulate all of that and create the documents that you see. So until about mid-morning, maybe later late morning, it's okay to update. And I believe some people did update their forecast based on what we saw today. You see, I mean, how are you, when you think about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year, or whenever they come, how do you, you know, how do you think about the economy where in now kind of post-pandemic? Do you think that there's been significant structural shifts? And is that gonna change how you look at a rate cut path? If the question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is a really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now, the one that would affect one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate of interest is. And so, for example, if it's risen, and I'm not saying that it has, but if it were to have risen, that would mean that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey the same level of restriction. I think as we're not really gonna know that, you know, people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it. So it's just that it's gonna be uncertain. So we're gonna be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really unprecedented environment. Someone once said that you know the natural rate of interest by its works, and that's really right. But that's very difficult because policy operates with a lag. So it's one of the reasons why we slowed down this year. We started slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction. And over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work. In terms of demand has demand shifted more away from services into goods, you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete and it doesn't look like it's ongoing, but I don't know if that's right. Maybe people just bought so much stuff that they temporarily don't want anymore stuff. They haven't got any place to put it. Okay, Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2% inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3.5 on core. On a six month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2.5%. Though when you look at super core and shelter, they are of course, stickier. So when looking at the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2% before you consider cutting rates? I mean, the reason you wouldn't wait to get to 2% to cut rates is that policy would be too late. I mean, you'd want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2%, because before you get to 2%, so you don't overshoot. If we think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity, it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, the effect economic activity, and effect inflation. So I can't give you a precise answer, but if you look at what's in the SEP, and I think you'll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take. Do you think that will be 30% would be reasonable? I wouldn't want to identify any one precise point, because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be right. But we'll be looking at it and looking at the broad collection of factors. There are two. Yeah. Hi, Chair Powell, Genie with Market News. I wanted to go back to the stickiness of inflation question. Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bangers have talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2%. Yet it's also been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year. I'm curious, do you think something has changed in our understanding of inflation? Or do you subscribe to this notion still? Or is it something different about the US economy? Thank you. I think this, we felt since the beginning that it would be a combination of two factors. The first factor is just the unwinding of what happened in the pandemic, the distortions to supply and demand. And the second thing would be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand. We thought those two things were going to be necessary. So I say the last part of your question again.",0.0008356725020891,0.0014148516549476252
2023-12-13 18:30:00,2023-12-13 19:10:00,2023-12-13 19:14:51," If there was something different about the U.S. economy. Yeah, so it's not that it may or may not be about different the U.S. economy being different. I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload pot boiling over kind of inflation that we think about. It was a combination of very strong demand without question and unusual supply side restrictions, on the good side but also on the labor side because we had a participation shock. So this is just very unusual. And we had the view, my colleagues and I broadly had the view that we could get a lot of, you know, we had essentially a vertical supply curve because you ran into the limits of capacity at very low levels because there weren't workers and because people couldn't, the supply chains were all broken. So we had the view that you could come straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand lowered. Reduced and you know something like that has happened. It happened so far. The question is, you know, once that part of it runs out and we think it has a ways to run. We definitely think that the sort of supply chain and shortages side has some ways to run. Does labor force participation have much more to run? It might, immigration could help but it may be that at some point you will run out of supply side help. And then it goes down to demand and it gets harder. That's very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be different, I'd be reluctant to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We just don't know. I mean inflation keeps coming down. The labor market keeps getting back into balance. And you know, it's so far so good although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here but so far it hasn't. I'm going to make it the last question. Hi Chair Powell, thanks for taking our questions, making Cousello with Barons. I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed's focus now on proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts. And can you talk us through what the latest thinking is and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at all? We're not talking about altering the pace of QT right now. Just to get that out of the way. So balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. What we've been seeing is that we're allowing runoff each month. That's adding up. I think we're down. We're close to 1.2 trillion now. That's showing up the reverse repo facility has been coming down quickly and reserves have been either moving up or as a result or holding steady. At a certain point, they won't be any more to come out of. There'll be a level where the reverse repo facility levels out. And at that point, reserves will start to come down. We still have, you know, that we intend to reduce our securities holders until we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that consistent with ample reserves. And we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level. Judge to be consistent with ample reserves. We're not at those levels with reserves close to 3.5 trillion. We're not, we don't think we're at those reserves. There isn't a lot of evidence of that. We're watching it carefully. And so far it's working pretty much as expected with you. Adjusting that thinking at all by the time you're considering or moving forward with rate cuts. Is that time to rethink? Are you still going to follow that thinking? So I think they're on independent tracks. So you're asking the other question. I guess you're implying the question of can you continue with QT at such time with QT, which is a tightening action at such time as policy is still tight? And the answer is it depends on the reason. If you're cutting rates because you're going back to normal, that's one thing. If you're cutting them because the economy is really weak. So you can imagine you have to know what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time. Thanks very much.",0.0,0.0006639821795750562
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleague is and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high on going progress in bringing it down is not assured. In the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory and we have been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3%. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1%. Bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past 3 months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago, but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome, but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% of points, and we've decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways.",4.105006054891865e-05,0.0004719576285104008
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:35:00,2024-01-31 18:40:00," since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. As labor market tightness has eased, and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we've seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer run, longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our storing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions. Thank you for taking our questions. Obviously in the statement in your remarks there, you don't want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming down fully. I wonder what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? And as you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth and consumer spending data against the solid inflation progress you've been seeing? Sorry, I see it last 40 years. How are you weighing the growth data and consumption data which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data? Okay. So what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We're looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And, implicitly, we do have confidence and has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It's not that we're looking for better data. So we're looking at continuation of the good data that we've been seeing. And a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that's six months of good inflation data. Is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a sustainable path down to 2% inflation? That's the question. And the answer will come from some more data that's also good data. It's not that the six month data isn't low enough. It is. So, what is the question of can we take that with confidence that we're moving sustainably down to 2%? That's really what we're thinking about. In terms of growth, we've had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth, very strong growth last year, going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down. So I think, whereas a year ago, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening and economic activity. That hasn't been the case. So I think we look at stronger growth, we don't look at it as a problem. I think at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We're not looking for a weaker labor market. We're looking for inflation to continue to come down as it has been coming down for the last six months. And I'm sorry, if I could just follow up very quickly. When you say that you want to make sure that the true signal is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it's a true signal at this stage? No, I think it's, I would say it seems to be the likely case that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it and we haven't yet. And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have six months of good inflation. But you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation, for example. And goods inflation running significantly negative. It's a reasonable assumption that over time, goods inflation will flatten out, probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number, not so much the composition, but we just need to see more. That's where we are as a committee. We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms.",-0.0003694353795948,0.0005954458657577982

Well, I look I think as you know we consult the range of Taylor rules and non-tailor kind of rules we consult them regularly they're in our our teal book and and They're in all the materials that we look at but you know I don't think we've ever been at a state at a place where we were we were setting policy by them And they're depending on the rule It will tell you different things are many different formulations another way to think about it is implicitly is so In theory of course real rates go up if holding all else equal as inflation comes down But that doesn't mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates Sorry as inflation comes down doesn't mean that at all because for one thing We we don't know we look at more than just the Fed funds rate we look at Brawley financial conditions, but in addition we don't know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is at any given time But that also doesn't mean that we wait around for To see you know the economy turn down because that will be too late So we're really in a risk management mode of managing the risk as I mentioned in my opening remarks managing the risk that we move too soon and Would move too late and I think to move which is which is where Almost everyone in the committee is is in favor of of moving rates down this year But the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2% I Thanks, Chair Bill I'd like you to to key it on the use of the word in the statement that inflation still remains elevated You've pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2% so that implies that there's some sort of intermediate step here on inflation and that Cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that Inflation remains elevated. What's the step down from there? Yeah, I I don't know that we worked out the particular Statement language and that kind of thing. I would just say if you look at you look at where we're 12-month inflation is and It's you know, it's still well above core is 2.9% for example 12 months, which is way down from where it was very Very positive development very fast decline and and you know I the the cases likely that it will continue to come down So so that's where that's where it is, but we're you know, we're wanting to see you know more data So if I could follow up on that this statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut but it doesn't mention the other side of the mandate a slighted employment Would a slighted employment also bring you to the point of cutting rates? Yes, so Let me say that we're not looking for that's not something we're looking for Yes, if you think about you know in the base case",0.0005851435141461,0.0006364980289093344
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:45:00,2024-01-31 18:50:00," the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong. If we saw an unexpected weakening in certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner, absolutely. And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things would argue for moving later. In the base case, though, where the economy is healthy, and we have, you know, we have fond going growth, solid growth, we have a strong labor market, we have inflation coming down. That's what people are writing their SEP around. And in that case, what we're saying is based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction. Thank you. Claire Jones, financial times. Mr. Circle back to the greater confidence aspect of the statement. There's been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings and just wondering going forward when it comes to all needing greater confidence. Is the unanimity, or at least consensus among FOMC members, about what the threshold for that greater confidence is? And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that greater confidence threshold could be reached. Thank you. We're not really at that stage. There was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the SEP as good evidence of where people are, although it is one cycle later. So we're not at a place of really working out those kinds of details because we weren't actively considering moving the federal funds rate down. I will say there is a wide disparity, a healthy disparity of views, and you see that in public statements in the minutes and the transcripts when they're released every five years. So we do have a healthy set of differences and I think that's actually essential for making good policy. We're also able to reach agreement generally because we listen to each other, we compromise and even though not everybody loves what we do, they're able to, for the most part, able to join in to me that's a well-functioning public institution. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. So over the past few years, there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like, open table data or office attendance. You've talked about vacancies in the past. And I'm wondering at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that's giving you the clearest picture of the economy, including on runs if you could touch on that? Including rent costs? Yeah. Well, so we're not, you know, it's not the pandemic. So we can actually rely on more traditional forms. People are working, they're getting wages and the economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn't say we're looking at that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you point to rent. So of course, we follow the components of inflation very carefully, which would be goods inflation. I talked about that a little bit. You mentioned housing inflation. So the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into measure grant measurement as measured in PCE inflation? And we think that's coming. And we know it's coming. It's just a question of when and how big it will be. So that's in everyone's forecast, I would say. So that will help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably. It's been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort and probably that the clients over time, but it may well have some more time to run. You know, the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were in addition. It takes time for the healing process to get into prices. So there may be still a tailwind. We'll find out with that. So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully and as you would imagine. I guess this is a quick follow-up. Do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing or is that part of looking for more confidence? No, I wouldn't say we would achieve that. And I think we have a ways to go. Inflation is still, you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis. 12 months is our target. Certainly, I'm encouraged and we're encouraged by the progress. But, you know, we're not declaring victory at all at this point. We think we have a ways to go. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",0.0005540166204985,0.0006258400106699566
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:50:00,2024-01-31 18:55:00," I'm wondering what you could tell me how do you believe the neutral rate is working, we're telling you right now that growth is stronger. In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? I think you do see in the interest sensitive parts of the economy, you do see, for example, housing, you see the effects. Your second question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is a lot of this has come through a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you've seen that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter policy, which has enabled the supply side to recover, I think, is that that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So we really do think that we're having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it's a joint story. It's a complicated story. But how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy? Would you say relative to the neutral rate? Of course, you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision. But if you, a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate 5.3 percent, let's say, and subtract sort of a forward measure of inflation. If you do that, there are many, many ways to calculate that neutral rate, but that's what I like to do. And you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate, you will. But at the same time, you look at the economy, and you say this is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. And you say, what does that tell you about the neutral rate? What's happening, though, is the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that won't go on forever. So a lot of the growth we're seeing is not, it isn't just a tug of war between interest rates and demand. You're getting more activity because of the labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is when that peters out, I think the restriction will show up probably more sharply. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks for taking the question from the chairman. You mentioned earlier we're not seeking a weaker labor market, I think. You said, can you talk a little bit more about that? Do you think the labor market now is back to, quote unquote, normal? And that we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic, even with today's ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic levels. I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal, but not totally back to normal. I think the job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages are, wage increases rather are not quite back to where they would need to be in the longer run. I would look at it this way though. The economy is broadly normalizing and so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens. And you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that's okay. That's okay. But we do see, you saw today's ECI reading, you know, the evidence is that wage increases are still at a healthy level, very healthy level, but they're gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated given assumptions about productivity or more typically associated with 2% inflation. It's an ongoing process, a healthy one, and I think we're moving in the right direction. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically. I think the labor market is, it's rebalancing. Clearly there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened, you remember, 2021, you had a severe labor shortage. It was everywhere panic on a part of businesses couldn't find people. So what's happened is we expected labor, the labor labor market to come back quickly and it didn't. And in 2022 was a disappointing year. And you know, we were kind of thinking, well, maybe we won't get it back. And then 2023, we did. As you know, so labor force participation came back strongly in 23 and so did immigration.",-0.0006357018353327,0.0006977078245879933
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:55:00,2024-01-31 19:00:00," immigration came to a halt during the pandemic. So, and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to will it still a very strong labor market. It's still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it's getting back into balance and that's what we want to see. And, you know, one great way to look at that is what's happening with wage increases. And you see it now across the major things that we track. It isn't every quarter, but overall there's a clear trend. Still at high levels, but back down to where would be what would be consistent with where we were before the pandemic and with 2% inflation. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruggabour, an associated press. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Rich's question. It sounded like you suggested that you're not worried about faster growth so much. So, I wanted to see if you're seeing anything that suggests inflation could re-accelerate from here. And it sounds like you're saying you're not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you. No, I think that is a risk. The risk that inflation would re-accelerate. I think the greater risk is that it would stabilize at a level, meaningfully above 2%. That's to me more likely. Of course, if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would be a surprise at this point, but I have to tell you that's why we keep our options open here and why we're not rushing. So, I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is you've had six good months, very good months. But what's really going to shake out here? When we look back, what will we see? Will the inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are one of the factors that won't repeat themselves? We don't think so. We know this is not what we think, but that's the question we are asking. We have to ask, and we want to get comfort on that. And just one quick follow-up, Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something you're watching as well? And if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence and where things are going? We'll just have to see. Yeah, we'll look at those. Last year was it a surprise. Mike. Michael McKeeblumberg radio and television. If you don't want to use the term soft landing, would you say at least that from your point of view now the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risk of diminished very much? And as you mentioned, below 2% inflation for on a three-month basis, CorePC has been running at 1.5%. And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? So how to describe your first question, how to describe where we are. So I guess I would just say this. Executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market, 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4% that hasn't happened in 50 years. So it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is a good situation. Let's be honest. This is a good economy. But what's the outlook? That's looking in the review. The outlook, we do expect growth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time and it hasn't happened. But we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. Labor market is rebalancing. As I mentioned, job creation has slowed the base of job growth has narrowed. And of course, 12-month inflation is above target and getting down closer to target. It's not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and questions we have to answer. But overall, it's a pretty good picture. It is a good picture. Your second question was sorry. Could you get inflation that is below target, end up with inflation below target and you have to do something about that? So the thing is, we're not looking for inflation to tap the 2% base once. We're looking for to settle out over time.",0.0001846759962244,0.0005130204592559151
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 19:00:00,2024-01-31 19:05:00," at 2%. And the same thing is true. If we have a month or two of lower and we have that now of inflation that's annualized at a lower level, that wouldn't be good. We're not looking to have inflation anchor below 2%, we're looking to have it anchor at 2%. So if we do face those circumstances then we'll have to deal with that. I think as of now the question we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. Edward. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you for taking this. So as I've heard from some district Fed presidents is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner and then when we do see that first rate cut is that to be interpreted as the beginning of a rate cut cycle or is it a one off? So I'll point to that language on your first question. We included that language in the statement to signal clearly that with strong growth, strongly of a market inflation coming down, the committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context, current context, we're going to be data dependent, we're going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that, but that's to be seen. So I wouldn't call, you know, when you say, when you ask me about in the near term, I'm hearing that as March, I would say I don't think that's probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. Then your second question is. On the, is this the start of a, when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle or is it, you could have just been one off? You know, that's going to depend on the data. The whole thing is this is going to depend on the data. We're going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks and we're going to make our decisions based on that. And it could wind up, you know, we'll, we'll have another SEP at the March meeting and people write down what they think, but in the end, it's really going to depend on how the economy evolves. We talked about there are risks that would cause us to go slower. For example, stronger inflation, more, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us to, or if they happen that would cause us to go faster or sooner. And that would be a weakening in the labor market or for that matter, very, very persuasive, lower inflation. Those are the kinds of things. So we're just, we're just going to be reacting to the data. That's, that's really the only way we can do this. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth? You know, you've mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that's consistent with 2% inflation. We've obviously seen, you know, you were talking about ECI this morning in which it's cooled a little bit, but still sort of above what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about? Or do you think that productivity growth will, will fade over time? So this is a really interesting question. And I think my, my own view is, I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off and, and activity didn't decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough of productivity. And then over the last, you saw high productivity last year in 23. I think we're, we're basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question will be, what, what is it that has changed the, you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy? Is there, is there a case, will it be the case that we come out of this more productive, more on a sustained basis? And I don't know, I don't know. I, I, what would it take? It would take, you know, people talk about AI, but I would, my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were because I'm not sure I see work from home doesn't seem like it's a big productivity increase or AI, artificial intelligence generative may be, but probably not in the short run, probably maybe in the longer run. So I'm not, I'm not seeing why it would, but, you know, right, you know, right now, I would say we're, the productivity is kind of what falls out of the, the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and, and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed. Right. So would that be behind why we've seen such strong growth, but we've also seen inflation fall that maybe there's just a higher level of productivity that's one way to look at it. Yeah.",-0.0021541554684775,0.004509513219668886
2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 19:05:00,2024-01-31 19:10:00," Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I'm wondering how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates. And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. So when we think about our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability and that's what we're targeting. We're not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing or any of those things. Those are very important things for people's lives, but they're not, you know, those are not the things we're targeting. We're also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be hurt because it's a very interesting sensitive sector. On top of that, we have longer run problems with the availability of housing. We have a built-up set of cities and people moving further and further out so that there hasn't been enough housing built. And these are not things that we have any tools to address. But where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. That's really rental inflation. You're taking owners equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants and you're running that through the CPI calculation or the PCE calculation, the one we look at. And what that's telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time it has to as long as that remains the case. So. Just real quick, what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable? My response is what I started with, which is that our job, the job Congress has given us, is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is absolutely essential for people's lives most importantly for not most importantly, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges at the margins. And so for someone like that high inflation in the necessities of life right away you're in trouble whereas even middle class people have some scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get, it's our job. It's what societies asked us to do is to get inflation down. The tools that we use to do it are interest rates. So that's how we think about that. Courtney. Courtney Brown from Axios. Can you give us some insight into whether the committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead? Yes. So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well and as the processes continued we're getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at this meeting we did have some discussion of the balance sheet and we're planning to begin in depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those questions are all coming into scope now and we're focusing on them but we're at the beginning of that process I would say. Quick follow up. The case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem? Yes. We see those as independent tools and so they don't. For example if you're normalizing policy you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases that's normalization but from a strict monetary policy standpoint you could say we're loosening and one with tightening. So that could happen. It's not something we're planning or thinking about but right now we're thinking about getting to a place where we're going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We're watching it carefully and as I said we'll be looking into that as a committee starting in March. Thanks. Slide. Slide, I'm going to switch with the economist. Thank you Chair Powell. You've mentioned six good months of inflation data but not being enough to build up confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn't start easing yet in March. The implication is that eight good months might not be enough either. Roughly how many months do you think you might need of good inflation data to be confident? I'm not in the position to put a number on it. I'm just going to say it's not that we don't have any confidence. We have growing confidence but not to the point where we feel like it's a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialing back.",-0.000267269736842,0.0020781465401946276

And we want to get that right, and we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market inflation coming down, it gives us the ability to do that. We think that's the best way we can serve the public because ultimately we've made a lot of progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way. That's how we're thinking about it. In terms of when that'll be, that'll all come out of our communications, and we won't keep that a secret. Hi, Chair Powell. Evan Reiser with M&I Market News. Can you explain a little bit more on what you're considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there? Not a decision that we've made, but I wouldn't think we'd be taking a position that's got to go to zero. I mean, if it were to stabilize it a different way, but that's not a decision that we've made. That's what we'll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up in the committee. We'll get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let's say, year or so. Great. Thanks, Craig Grapp from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I want to change gears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that's been going on for the last nine months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates have said that they probably wouldn't want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about that. Do you want another term you've had on the Fed? What's your stance on that? I don't have a stance on that. It's not something I'm focused on. Focused on doing our jobs. This year is going to be a highly consequential year for the Fed and for monetary policy, and we're all of us very buckled down focused on doing our jobs. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Johnberger with Yahoo Finance. As you mentioned, Core PCE has been running at 1.9% over the past six months, and you guys are actually expecting Core inflation higher this year at 2.4% compared to that six month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it's been over the last six months for the next six months? So we're going to do, we'll update our inflation forecasts at the next meeting. You refer to the December meeting that's three months old, so it might be lower now given the data we've gotten. So look, as I mentioned, we're going to be racking to the data. If we get very strong inflation data and it kicks back up, then it will go slower or later or both. If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the, that would tell us that we could go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we're just going to be, but of course we'll weigh that with all the other factors. We're setting policy based on the totality of the data. But just to follow, if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive, would that mean you'd have to trim more perhaps than you already have factored in? Well, I think if we came to the view that if the inflation were, that the six month inflation numbers, which are very close to two, were in PCE world, if we came to the, if we thought that is really where we're going to be, then yes, our policy would be in a different place. But, you know, that's the whole point is we're trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where that inflation is on a sustainable bet path down to two percent or toward two percent. Hi, Chepp, Daniela Davis, Ajahn's Foreign Press. I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just wonder, is it fair to say that they're moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent months? And, you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that and what challenges do you see going forward? Thank you. Yes, so it's been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak at a time when unemployment has been low, very low, historically low for a couple of years. But nonetheless, that's been the case. And we've asked ourselves why that is and that, you know, one obvious answer, we don't pretend to have perfect wisdom on this, is, but one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So, prices went up much more than 2 percent per year for a couple of years and people are going to the store and they're paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago, three years ago, and they're not happy about it. And it's fine that inflation's at...",0.000143935188041,0.0016422914738249822

So that is what that has to be some part of why people are unhappy, and they're right to be unhappy. You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It's why we need to do our jobs, is so that people don't have to deal with things like this. In terms of it, you're right, in recent surveys, a couple of, you've seen a couple of significant increases in consumer-confident or happiness with the economy. I guess that's a good thing. That can support spending, can support economic activity. There's some evidence of that. But you're right, it is the fact that we have seen a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they've been at various times, but they certainly have come up. Thank you for taking our questions. Brian Manistina in business. So, committee members have said they like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data subject to large revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments, being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So, did any members say they learned anything, not you reflected in the data, or have you yourself, or anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn't been captured in the data yet? Well, yes. I'm a big believer that yes. So, we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy, and I always feel like you, I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies, individual companies, individual management teams, and then building out from that. And so, starting with GDP data, and working into what's actually affecting people's lives, is challenging. It's very hard. So, I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 reserve banks have really the best network of anyone, that in all their districts, they're talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so, when they come back, that's what goes into the beige book, but that they come back in what each reserve bank president does is during the outlook go around. They'll say in my district, and they'll talk about 100 conversations, say, not they won't talk up. They will give you input based on 100 conversations that they've had with people of all different walks. And it's, I personally find it very helpful in understanding what's going on. And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. Did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they've heard from, like their district? Yes, I mean, if you look back, the last, not this, beige book, but the one before, it was more, there was a lot of slower activity. I think that what you're hearing now is things are picking up a bit. You're hearing not in every district, and not every person that we talk to, but your overall, it feels like you're hearing things picking up at the margin. So, that's what comes through. Good, Jeff Cox for the last question. Thank you, sir. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all together. You talked about basically the economy looking strong with 3.3% annualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat, might, that you're in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you're more tilted towards that. And also perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now that inflation could come back at some point? I'm not so worried about that. It's, again, we've had inflation come down without a slow economy, and without, you know, important increases in unemployment. And there's no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process if it's going to continue. So, I am, you know, I think declining inflation continued to climb in inflation. Are really the main thing we're looking at. Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong too. We don't have a growth mandate. We've got a maximum employment mandate and a price stability mandate. And those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two mandates. Thank you.",-0.0009765624999999,0.0014407145944388183
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong and that is very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year's pace with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over the next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply. The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate has edged up, but remains low at 3.9 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Numeral wage growth has been easing and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demands still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased notably over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12-month sending in February, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as from measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent this year, 2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2026. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent, and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are come",-0.0030135610246106,0.003895046895589472

We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation, and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2%. Of course, we are committed to both sides of our dual mandate and unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6% at the end of this year, 3.9% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2006, still above the median longer term funds rate. These projections are not a committee decision or plan if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion since the committee began reducing our portfolio. At this meeting, we discussed issues related to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings. While we did not make any decisions today on this, the general sense of the committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise, but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress, and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings, consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping our longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability over the long term. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. Steve Leisman, CNBC, Mr. Chairman. The projections show somewhat higher core inflation. They also show somewhat stronger growth. What should we infer from this note to that on average? Rates were kept the same this year, but inflation is higher and growth is higher. Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness to slow the economy to achieve that target? Well, it doesn't know. It doesn't mean that. What it means is that we've seen incoming, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our growth forecast and so have many other forecasters. So the economy is performing well. And the inflation data came in a little bit higher as a separate matter. And I think that caused people to write up their inflation. But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on bringing inflation down. And so... When you just to follow up, when you say that you're willing to either maintain the rate for longer, is what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation coming in above its 2% target? We're strongly committed to bringing inflation.",0.0029937799135775,0.0042070569988369

Markets believe we will achieve that goal and they should believe that because that's what will happen over time. But we stress over time. And so I think we're making projections that do show that happening and we're committed to that outcome and we will bring it about. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is coming, but it still hasn't shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE. Does that challenge your assumption about when the shift will finally break through since it hasn't at that point? So I think there's some confidence that the market rents, lower market rent increases that we're seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time. There's a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there's real confidence that they will show up eventually over time. But again, uncertainty about the exact timing of that. And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if housing doesn't break through quickly and does that affect the timing for the eventual cuts this year? We will get aggregate inflation down to 2% over time, we will. And I would assume that we will continue to see is we'll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they're going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year. We're housing services inflation will come back down as current market rents or suggesting will happen. And where non-housing services will move back down. Some combination of those three things and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2% sustainably. Nick. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal, Chair Powell, during your congressional test to money this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2% because interest rates are well above neutral. At the same time you said here after the last meeting that the first cut is highly consequential. Can you reconcile these views from me? If rates are well above neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential? Is that because you anticipate one cut would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019 which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995? Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal, Chair Powell, during your congressional test to money, you said that your results were really too side at here. We're in a situation where if we ease too much or too soon we could see inflation come back and if we use too late we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people's working lives. We do see the risks as too side and so it is consequential. We want to be careful, unfortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong and with inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that. That's really what I was thinking. How much of that inflation that we've seen so far this year, do you chalk up to one off calendar adjustment effects, followed in a period of high inflation versus some change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year? I want to start by being saying I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don't like so you need to check yourself on that and I'll do that. I would say the January number which was very high, the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high, there's reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there. But nonetheless we don't want to be completely dismissive of it. The February number was high, higher than expectations, but we have it at currently, well below 30 basis points, core PCE, which is not terribly high. So it's not like the January number. But I take the two of them together and I think they haven't really changed the overall story which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes bumpy road toward 2%. I don't think that story has changed. I also don't think that those readings added to anyone's confidence that we're moving closer to that point. But you know we didn't, I'd less thing I'll say is we didn't excessively celebrate the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year. We didn't take too much signal out of that. What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you know, we wanted to be careful about that decision. And we're not going to overreact as well to these two months of data. Nor are we going to ignore them. Hi, yes, Chair Powell. I could just speak a little bit more about the timing. Is there",0.0007824423793975,0.0026491346804602234
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:45:00,2024-03-20 18:50:00," enough data between now and say may to be able to get the kind of confidence that you say that you still need or by June is there enough data for you? Just give us a sense of your thinking there. Thank you. Yes, so we're we make decisions meeting by meeting and we didn't make any decisions or about about future meetings today. Those are going to depend on our ongoing assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks. So I've I really don't have anything for you on any specific meeting looking forward. But I mean just a question of I mean is there even enough data for you to be able to? We'll take you know things can happen during an intermeeting period if you look back unexpected things. So I don't want to I wouldn't want to dismiss anything. So I just would say that the committee wants to see more data that gives us higher confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2%. I also mentioned and we don't see this in the data right now but if there were a significant weakening in the data particularly in the labor market that could also be a reason for us to to begin the process of reducing rates. Again I don't there's nothing in the data pointing at that but those are the things that we'll be looking at at coming meetings and it without without trying to refer to any specific meeting. Chris. Hi Chris Reaver associated press thank you. In the projections there is an increase in the neutral rate as you know and higher rates a quarter point higher rates projected in 2025 2026. Can you speak about why might be behind that is there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will be needed in the future. Thank you. So you're right they're pretty modest changes but you're right there was an uptick in the longer run rate and also there's a 25 basis point increase in 25 and 26 in terms of our rates going to be higher in the in the longer run if that's really your question. I don't think we know that. I think it's it's we think that rates were generally low during the pre pandemic post global financial crisis era for for reasons that are mostly you know important slow moving large things like demographics and productivity and and and that sort of thing things that don't move quickly but I don't think we know I mean I my my instinct would be that rates will not go back down to the very low levels that we saw were all around the world. There were long run rates that were at or below zero in some cases I don't see love rates going back down to that level but I think there's tremendous uncertainty around that great and just a quick follow on the projections you also have 2.6% core inflation for the end of this year it's already it are you mentioned it being 2.8 in February I mean that doesn't sound like much disinflation at all so are you really are you still confident or the last press conference you sounded pretty optimistic you would get more confidence to the end of this year is it right to say that this suggests you're not seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we've seen 2023 and so I think that that that higher year and number reflects the data we've seen so far this year because you're now here now in this year so I think that sorry say you're less part of your question again we'll just still optimistic that you will get the confidence you need this year. I you know I think if you look at if you look at the SCP what it says is that it is still likely in in in most people's view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate cuts but that's really going to depend on the on the incoming data it is the other thing is in the second half of the year you have some pretty low readings so it might be harder to make progress as you move that 12 month window forward nonetheless we're looking for data that confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and and give us a higher degree of confidence that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2% toward 2% thank you. Gina Smiley the New York Times thank you for taking our questions a pretty recommend to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut would continue to strengthen the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts and just in general if labor supply continued to rebound in 2024 the way it did in 2023 what would stronger hiring and possibly stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy",0.0024504998263152,0.0026245706125284916
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:50:00,2024-03-20 18:55:00," So, if we're getting is a lot of supply and a lot of demand and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they're spending and that's, you know, what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing. In fact, they were decreasing. So you can have that if you have the continued supply side activity that we had last year with both with supply chains and also with growth in the size of the labor force. But so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to hold off on rate cuts? No, not all by itself. No, I mean, we saw, you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly. We now have a better sense that a big part of that was supply side healing particularly with growth in the labor force. So in and of itself strong job growth is not a reason, you know, for us to be concerned about inflation. Neil. I'd share Powell and Neil or one of the axioms. How do you assess the state of financial conditions right now and particularly in particular do you view the kind of easing in financial conditions since the fall is consistent and compatible with what you're trying to achieve on the inflation mandate? So we think there are many different financial conditions indicators and you can kind of see different answers to that question. But ultimately we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity and we think you see that in a great place to see it as in the labor market where you've seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels and there I would point to job openings, quits, surveys, the hiring rate, things like that are really demand. There are also supply side things happening but I think those are demand side things happening. You know we saw that's been a question for a while. We did see progress on inflation last year, significant progress despite financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser. Mike, I'm going to get you with Bloomberg Radio and television. Can you give us more color on how the committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now, what we've seen at the beginning of the year. Are they more one off increases that will fade or is there more of a secular turn with good prices rising again and service prices staying sticky. And also housing prices have been sort of the godo of this cycle in that you keep expecting them to go down and they don't. How does the committee see this playing out forward since you've raised your inflation forecast. So I see the committee looking at the two months of data and asking the same question and you're asking and saying we're just going to have to see what the data show. As I mentioned you can look at January which is very high reading and you can, I think many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there. But again you know what you got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don't like. Then February wasn't as high but it was higher. So the question is what are we going to see. We tend to see a little bit stronger, this is in the data, a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year. We're going to let the data show. I don't think we really know whether this is a bump on the road or something more. We'll have to find out. In the meantime the economy is strong, the labor market is strong, inflation has come way down and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and you know feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 2% when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy. Well you've talked about the desire to have confidence that inflation is continually moving down, has the recent numbers we've gotten for inflation data dented that confidence at all? It certainly hasn't improved our confidence, it doesn't raise any less confidence but confidence. But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of inflation coming down gradually toward 2% on a sometimes bumpy path as I mentioned. I think that's what you still see. We've got nine months of 2.5% inflation now and we've had two months of kind of bumpy inflation. We were saying that it's going to be a bumpy ride. We consistently said that now here are some bumps and the question is are they more than bumps and we just don't, we can't know that. That's why we are approaching this question carefully. It is very important for everyone.",-0.000562908488868,0.0018319609695893163
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:55:00,2024-03-20 19:00:00," that we serve, that we do get inflation sustainably down. And I think the historical record, it's every situation is different, but the historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately prematurely. Good, Emily. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to ask you, Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from both Federal Reserve for independent body understanding Congress has oversight over that. You received a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon White House that said, calling on you to lower interest rates to cut interest rates because it says, quote, the potential that it may remain too high for too long has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant climate and economic benefits from these projects. So it has higher interest rates caused that. Have they, well, first of all, I respect, you know, we, in our system of government, it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed. We place a tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them with, with great respect. In this case, I would say those are, you know, our mandate, our mandate is for maximum employment and price stability and the other things that we do. And that's what we're trying to accomplish. We're trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we're seeing, the strong labor market we're seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation. That's how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues in which in many cases are incredibly important, such as those you mentioned, and those are the reasons for the lack of responsibility for those. There's another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying that the higher rates are squeezing the working people. How do these letters affect what you guys are doing policy was? We receive these respect, these letters with respect and we write careful responses and address concerns. We listen again because we're talking to the people who in our system of government have oversight over our activity. But at the end of the day, we take that on board, but we have to make our judgments and we have to stick to our knitting, which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the payment system, the things that we do. Hiya. Thank you. Claire Jones, financial times. Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask a question. As chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent before you begin cutting rates? Thank you. We're very consensus oriented organization and we do try to achieve consensus and ideally unanimity. People do dissent. It's something that happens. Life goes on and it's not a problem. We've always had dissents. And so you respect thoughtful dissents very much. You may not agree with some arguments, but you really want to understand them. So you may read a book that takes a position that you have long opposed just to understand that book. So I treat dissents with real respect as well. So Simon, would you say you would? Simon, I'm in a bit of it with the economist. Can you hear me? Yes. Obviously inflation is some ways away from target. Unemployment though, if you look at the projection for the full year, 4.0 percent. In February, we're already at 3.9 percent. So quite close to the median projection. Are you concerned at all that notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth, that in fact there may be some cracks appearing in the employment market? You talked about a significant deterioration in the labor market being a condition for easing rates. What would constitute that in your books? Thank you. So we, of course, monitor the one of our two goal variables. We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully. And I don't see those cracks today. And we follow all the possible stories that are out there about there being cracks. But the overall picture really is strong labor market. The extreme imbalances that we saw in the early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved. You're seeing high job growth. You're seeing big increases in supply. You're seeing strong wage growth. But wage growth is gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels. In many, many respects, the things are returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose. That's just...",-0.0005393016044224,0.0015807838374490319
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 19:00:00,2024-03-20 19:05:00," job openings, and quits, and surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this. How tight is the, how easy is it to find a job? How hard is it? How easy is it to find a worker? Those of both, the surveys have both come down. So the labor markets in, it's in good shape. You know, you do see things like the low, the low hiring rate. And people have made the argument that if, if, if, if layoffs were to increase, that would, that would mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment. So that's something we're watching, but we're not seeing it. Of course, initial claims are, are very, very low. And if anything, have tracked, tracked down a little bit. So watching it carefully, don't see it. And when I say something, I, I, I use the term unexpected weakening in the labor market. So, you know, we do expect the unemployment rate to, you know, the forecast is that it would move up, I think, closer to what we see as the longer, unsustainable level. That's just a, that's just people's forecast, individual forecast. But we're talking about something that's unexpected. That's, that's where I'll leave it though. Let's see. I'll see Matthews with Bloomberg. I, you mentioned at the beginning of the press conference that it, that the committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff fairly soon. I'm wondering is, when, you say fairly soon, does that mean that the committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that soon? And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the committee is discussing here. You're at $95 billion of, of, of caps right now. Would that be cut about in half or something in that nature? Thank you. So that is what we're discussing, essentially, is, is, and we're not discussing all the other, many other balance sheet issues. We will discuss those in the, in due course. But what we're really looking at is, is slowing the pace of runoff. There isn't much runoff among MBS, MBS right now, but there isn't. Treasuries and we're talking about going to a lower pace. I don't want to give you a specific number because we haven't made, haven't made had an agreement or a decision, but that's, that's the idea. And that's what we're looking at. And, and in terms of the timing, I said fairly soon, I wouldn't want to try to be more specific than that, but you get the idea. The idea is, and this is in our, in our longer run plans, that we may actually be able to get to a lower level because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can, can happen. Liquidity is not evenly distributed in the system. And there can be times when, in the aggregate, reserves are, are ample or even abundant, but not in every part. And those, those parts where they're not ample, there can be stress. And that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the stress. And then it would be very hard to restart, we think. So, as something like that happened in, in 19, perhaps. So, so that's what we're doing. We're looking at what would be a good time and what would be a good structure. And you know, fairly soon is words that we use to mean fairly soon. And will there be a discussion about returning to an alt treasuries balance sheet at some point? So that are, are longer run goal is, is to a return to a balance sheet that is mostly treasuries. I do expect that once we're through this, we'll, we'll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues. But it's, you know, not urgent right now. We want to get, want to get this, this decision made first. And then we can, when the time is right, come back to the other issues. Hi, Victoria. Hi, Victoria Aguido with Politico. Also on the balance sheet, you know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your balance sheet plans? Do you worry that as deposits start to shrink that we could see more turbulence? You know, we'll, we'll be watching carefully. But one of the reasons we're, we're slowing down, we will soon enough fairly soon. I should say slow down is that we want to avoid any, any kind of, of, of that of turbulence. I wasn't thinking particularly about a, that banking sector turbulence, but we, and we, we had some indicators the last time. This is our second time in, in doing this. And I think we're, we're going to be paying a lot of attention to the, the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at, at the end of that tightening cycle where we, where we wound up in a short reserve situation. And we don't want to do that again. And I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators. It isn't, it wasn't so much in the banking system as it was around.",0.0006166297331148,0.0014455323413769176

We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs though. Well is it also because you're not sure exactly how the Reserve Supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near at zero? Well I think we broadly think that once the overnight repo stabilizes either at zero or close to zero, that as the balance sheet shrinks we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar for dollar with that. That's what we think. Hi Chair Powell, Gene Young with M&I Market News. I wanted to ask also about the balance sheet. Well you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a smaller balance sheet size. Does that mean you don't have to make a decision on when to end QT at this point and will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner or will you wait until we're close to the end? So the sort of ironic that by going slower you can get farther but that's the idea. The idea is that with a smoother transition you won't run much less risk of liquidity problems which can grow into shocks and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely. So that's where in terms of how it ends we're going to be monitoring carefully money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they're telling us about reserves. Right now we would characterize them as abundant and what we're aiming for is ample. Which is a little bit less than abundant. There isn't a dollar amount or percent of GDP or anything like that. We think we have a really pretty clear understanding of that. We're going to be looking at what's happening in money markets and particularly a bunch of different indicators including the ones I mentioned to tell us when we're getting close. Then though you reach a point ultimately where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run off and you but then from that point there's another period in which non-reserve liabilities grow organically like currency and that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace. So you have a slower pace of runoff which will have fairly soon. Then you have another time where you effectively hold the balance sheet constant and allow non-reserve liabilities to expand. And then that ultimately brings you ideally in for, you know, brings it into a nice easy landing at a level that is above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be. We're not trying for that. We want to have a cushion above because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile and we don't want to again find ourselves in a situation where there aren't reserves or we have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019-20. Hi Nancy Marshall-Gincer with Marketplace. Chirpall, you said you're waiting to become more confident than inflation is getting to your 2% goal before you cut rates. Can you just sum up more specifically what data you're looking at that would give you that confidence? Sure. So we're most importantly we're looking at the incoming inflation data and the contents of it and what they're telling us. So that'll be and also the various components. So obviously that's what we want. One more confidence that inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2%. And I mean of course we'll also be looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy. We'll look at the totality of the data including everything essentially as we make that assessment but the most important thing will be the inflation data that coming in. Are there things that you would give more weight to like wages? Wages is one thing. Our target is not wages, it's really inflation. But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong but they've been wage increases. That is to say wage increases have been quite strong but they're gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time. And that's what we want. We don't think that the inflation was not originally caused. We think I don't think.",0.000943650579671,0.001502137657435529

But we do think that to get inflation back down to 2% sustainably, we'd like to see continuing gradual movement of wage increases at still high levels, but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time. It's good. Great. Thank you, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, could you say at this meeting, whether there were more officials who wanted to be careful and go slower than about rates than were at the last meeting, was there that sense of maybe it's smart to wait? Thanks. I guess I put it this way. If you look at the incoming inflation data that we've had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we were right to wait until we're more confident. So I think I didn't hear anyone dismissing it as not information that we should look at it or anything like that. So I think, generally speaking, it does go in the direction of saying, yes, it's appropriate for us to be careful as we approach this question. Thanks, Chair Powell. Brendan Peterson with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff. We've been hearing a lot from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or is it doing in a digital dollar. But, folks, I know you have said to Congress that you are going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything, launches anything. But folks like House Majority, Wip, Tom Emmer, have said that the Fed is either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of a CBDC. Can you give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar? Sure. So I think we've been pretty transparent on this, but I will try harder. So we are not getting ready to propose. We haven't come to a conclusion that we should propose or anything like that that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar. And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the public of it. So we're just a long, long way from that. What we are doing, and I think what every major central bank is doing is we're trying to stay in the frontiers of what's going on in digital finance. And it has many, many different areas. It has applications in wholesale finance, in the payment system. And so we need to serve the public. These issues have become very front burner in the last five or six years. We need to be knowledgeable about all that. So we actually do have people trying to understand things that are, but it's wrong to say that we're working on a CBDC. And then we've got secretly got a lab here where we've got one. And we're just going to spring it on Congress at the right moment. We don't. I haven't at all, in my own mind, made a decision that I think this is something the US should be doing. I just think it's something we need to understand. And we do have people who are keeping up with that. As part of the broader payments landscape, that's how I would characterize it. Mark. Thank you. It's Mark Hamerick with Bankrate. Mr. Chairman, April 27th will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news conferences. How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper functioning of the central bank, and also in accomplishing your mission? And is there more that you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front and what might that look like? I generally think, I mean, this movement actually started 30 years ago when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank if the public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you, they'll react to the data. And so it all happens that way. And so there's been a march toward greater and greater transparency. And that certainly Chairman Brunanky advanced that. So Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did. And so we went from four press conferences a year to eight. So now every meeting really is live now. I think that's a good innovation. I wouldn't want to turn it back. We also have done a bunch of other things.",-0.0010485709613182,0.002216226633262627
2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 19:15:00,2024-03-20 19:17:58," You know, we have an annual supervision report, financial stability report. I mean, there's a long list of things that we've done. I think you, I mean, nothing comes to mind as really desperately in need of doing at this moment. We're very transparent. We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public through the media. And so that channel is full, I would say. So I think it's generally broadly helped and made things better, but not every day and in every way. Well, the follow-up is there ever been a day where you wanted to put that genie back in the bottle somewhat? Of course not. So. Let's go to Jennifer for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Burger with Yahoo Finance. Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation, but she did say earlier in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn't raised anyone's confidence. But when you testified before the Senate, a couple of weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are, quote, not far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates. So are you still of that belief or not? What are we to take by those words, not far? So let me say my main message at that in those two days of hearings was really that the committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2% goal. And we don't expect that it will be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we're more confident than that is the case. That is the case. I said that any number of times. So those were kind of the main part of the message. We repeated that today in our statement. I also, to the language you mentioned, I really pointed out that we had made significant progress over the past year. And what we're looking for now is confirmation that that progress will continue. We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last year that were really much lower. We didn't overreact as I mentioned, but that's what I had in mind. But given that you said that PCE, for February 2.8%, the estimate, and that we have been seeing PCE, core PCE coming down by 10% every month, I mean, wouldn't you be at about 2.4% this summer, June, July, to a point where you could cut then? Well, we'll just have to see how the data come in. We would of course love to get great inflation data. We got really good inflation data on the second part of last year. Again, we didn't overreact to it. We said we needed to see more. And we said it would be bumpy. And now we have January and February, which I've talked about a couple of times. So we're looking for more good data, and we would certainly welcome it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",0.0019933746774006,0.002253683906385578
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. The economy has eased substantially over the past year while the labor market has remained strong. That is very good news. But inflation is still too high. Further progress in bringing it down is not assured and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings though at a slower pace. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation and the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. However, in recent months inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2 percent objective and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases which excludes inventory investment, government spending and exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand was 3.1 percent in the first quarter as strong as the second half of 2023. Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarters even as high interest rates have weighed on housing and equipment investment. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. The labor market remains relatively tight but supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, but labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Full PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The inflation data received so far this year have been higher than expected. Although some measures of short term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 and a half percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our security holdings, though at a slower pace. Over the past year, as the labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We've stated that we do not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. So far this year, the data have not given up.",-1.9679169896865262e-05,0.004731105521619365
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:35:00,2024-05-01 18:40:00," that greater confidence. In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations. It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate. We are also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market. We know that reducing policy-over-stripe too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy-restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We will continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. Turning to our balance sheet, the committee decided that today's meeting to slow the pace of decline in our securities holdings consistent with the plans we released previously. Specifically, the cap on treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current 60 billion per month to 25 billion per month as of June and consistent with the committee's intention to hold primarily treasury securities in the longer run. We are leaving the cap on agency securities unchanged per month and we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in treasury securities. With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise, but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress, and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. I'm Howard Schneider with Reuters. A question to follow up with. Do you consider the current policy rate still, you confident that it's sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent? So I do think the evidence shows pretty clearly that policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand. There are a few places I would point to for that. You can start with the labor market. So demand is still strong, the demand side of the labor market in particular. But it's cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago. And you see that in job openings, you saw it more evidence of that today in the Jolts report, as you'll know. It's still higher than pre-pandemic, but it has been coming down both in the Indeed report and in the Jolts report. That's demand cooling. The same is true of quits and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized. I also look at the, we look at surveys of workers and pardon me, surveys of workers and businesses and ask workers are jobs plentiful and ask businesses are workers plentiful. Is it easy to find workers? And you've seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre-pandemic levels. You also see in an interest sensitive spending like housing and investment, you also see that higher interest rates are weighing on those activities. So I do think it's clear that policy is restrictive. So I would say that we believe it is restrictive and we believe over time it will be sufficiently restrictive. That will be a question that the data will have to answer. So as a follow-up, if inflation continues running roughly sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong unemployment low and expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for- Expectations are not anchored or stable, roughly. Would you disrupt that for the last half point on PCE? You know, I don't want to get into complicated hypotheticals, but I would say that we're committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy.",0.0022063408793677,0.006404373329077011
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:40:00,2024-05-01 18:45:00," as long as it's appropriate and we'll do that. Gina. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. I wonder, you know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to increase further, although it's not her baseline outlook. I wonder if you see that as a risk as well and if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point? So I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. I'd say it's unlikely. You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is how long to keep policy restrictive. You ask, what would it take? You know, I think we'd need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% over time. That's not what we think we're seeing as I mentioned, but that's something like that is what it would take. We'd look at the totality of the data answer to that question that would include inflation, inflation expectations and all the other data too. Would that be an acceleration in inflation? Well, I think, again, the test, what I'm saying is if we were to come to that conclusion that policy weren't tight enough to achieve that, so it would be the totality of all the things we're looking at. It could be expectations. It could be a combination of things, but if we reach that conclusion and we don't see evidence supporting that conclusion, that's what it would take, I think, for us to take that step. Chris. Thank you, Chris Regaber and Associated Press. You didn't mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn't mention the idea that it might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have a previous press conference, so has the Fed sort of dropped its easing bias? Where are you standing on that? So one, let me address cuts. So obviously our decisions that we make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving and the balance of risks as always, and we'll look at the totality of the data. So I think, and we think, that policy is well positioned to address different paths that the economy might take. And we've said that we don't think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance until we've gained greater confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2%. So for example, let me take a path. If we did have a path where inflation proves more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong, but inflation is moving sideways and we're not gaining greater confidence, well that would be a case in which it could be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts. I think there's also other paths that the economy could take, which would cause us to want to consider rate cuts. And those would be, two of those paths would be, that we do gain greater confidence, as we've said, if that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And another path could be an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example. So those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates. So I think it really will depend on the data. In terms of peak rate, I think really it's the same question. I think the data will have to answer that question for us. And could you just follow on the path where you might not cut? Is that, you mentioned that it would be inflation persistent? I mean, is inflation without the key data in making that decision? Or could you expand a bit more on that? Thank you. Again, we've set ourselves a test that we, for us to begin to reduce policy restriction, we'd want to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And for sure, one of the things we'd be looking at is the performance of inflation. We'd also be looking at inflation expectations. We'd be looking at the whole story, but clearly incoming inflation data would be, at the very heart of that decision. Nick Timberl, so the Wall Street Journal, Chair Powell, to what extent has the easing in financial condition since November contributed to the re-acceleration in growth? And do you now expect a period of sustained, tighter financial conditions will be needed to resume the sort of disinflation the economy saw last year? So I think it's hard to know that. I think we'll be able to look back from down the road and look back and understand it better. If you look at, let's look at growth. Really, what we've seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth coming in about consistent with where it was last year. I know GDP came in lower, but you don't see an acceleration.",0.0052960428443915,0.006093446072009831
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:45:00,2024-05-01 18:50:00," growth. I mean the thought would be that financial conditions loosen in December and that cause an uptick in activity and that caused inflation. Presumably that's what we're tightening in the labor market. You don't really see that happening. What you see is economic activity at a level that's roughly the same as last year. So what's causing this inflation will have a better sense of that over time. I don't know that there's an obvious connection there, though, with the easing of financial conditions. In terms of tightening, you're right, rates are certainly higher now and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting and they're higher and that's tighter financial conditions. That's appropriate given what inflation has done in the first quarter. You've said in the past that stronger growth wouldn't necessarily preclude rate cuts. I wonder would continued strength in the labor market change your view about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs that wage growth was reaccelerating? So I just want to be careful though, we don't target wage growth or the labor market and remember what we saw last year. Very strong growth, a really tight labor market and historically fast decline in inflation. That's because we know there are two forces at work here. There's the unwinding of the pandemic related supply side distortions and demand side distortions and there's also monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy. I wouldn't rule out that something like that can't continue. I wouldn't give up at this point on further things happening on the supply side either because we do see that companies still report that there are supply side issues that they're facing and also even when the supply side issues are solved, it should take some time for that to affect economic activity and ultimately inflation. So there are still those things. So I don't like to say that either strong growth or a strong labor market in and of itself would automatically create problems on inflation because of course it didn't do that last year. You ask about wages. We also don't target wages. We target price inflation. It is one of the inputs. The point with wages is of course we like everyone else like to see high wages but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation. That's really what we're trying to do is to cool the economy and work with what's happening on the supply side to bring the economy back to 2% inflation. Part of that will probably be having wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is sustainably moving back down to 2%. It's may now do you have time this year to cut three times just given the calendar? I'm not really thinking of it that way. What we said is that we need to be more confident and we've said my colleagues and I today said that we didn't see progress in the first quarter. And I've said that it appears that it's going to take longer for us to reach that point of conference. So I don't know how long it'll take. I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in scope. And I don't know exactly when that will be. And with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on now looking at the reports from January or February or March that suggested something more worrying than just expected bumping us? I, you know, I'm not really, you know, what, what, so I thought it was appropriate to reserve judgment until until we had the four quarters data until we saw the March data. And so take a step back. What do we now see in the first quarter? We see strong economic activity. We see a strong labor market and we see inflation. We see three inflation readings. And you, so I think you're at a point there where you should take some signal. I, we don't like to react to one or two months data, but this is a full quarter. And I think it's appropriate to take signal now. And we are taking signal. And the signal that we're taking is that it's likely to take longer for us to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path than a 2% inflation. That's the signal that we're taking at, yeah. I'm sure if I could, I see believes in CNBC, if I could follow up on that, what particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first quarter? What's the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and quarters? So we will, you know, we will put the thing, we have put the thing under a microscope. I will say,",-0.0009865630117795,0.0037220352405464173
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:50:00,2024-05-01 18:55:00," Nothing is going to come out of that that's going to change the view. I think that in fact, we didn't gain confidence in that it's going to take longer to get that confidence. But confidence, I just think, you know the story. What's happened since December is you've seen higher goods inflation than expected. And you've seen higher non-housing services inflation than expected. And those two are working together to sort of be higher than we had thought. And there are stories behind how that happened. And you know, I think my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation move back down. That's my forecast. I think my confidence in that is lower than it was because of the data that we've seen. So we're looking at those things. We also continue to expect that I continue to expect that housing services inflation, given where market rents are. Those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time. We believe that it will. It looks like that there are substantial lags between when lower market rates turned up and for new tenants. And when it shows up for existing tenants or for in housing services. So if I could just follow up. Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing while you're holding rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation? Thank you. No, I wouldn't say that. No, I mean the active tool of monetary policy is of course interest rates. And this is a long plan we've long had in place to slow really not in order to provide accommodation to the economy. But to be less restrictive to the economy, it really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one. It doesn't wind up with financial market turmoil the way it did the last time we did this and the only other time we've ever done this. Correct. For us from Bloomberg. Two questions first, simple one. Given the run of data since March. Has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased or stayed the same? That's the first question. Second question. Chair Powell, you joined the board in 2012. And I'm sure you remember as I do what the jobless recovery was like, lawyers, accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn't get jobs. And given your history there, I wonder if there's an argument for being more patient with inflation here. We have strong productivity growth. That's helping wages grow up. Go up. We have good employment. And so it seems to me there's a lot of hysteria about inflation. I agree. It's nobody likes it. But is there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over time? Thank you. So on your first question, I don't have a probability estimate for you. But all I can say is that we've said that we didn't think it'd be appropriate to cut until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably at 2%. We didn't get our confidence in that didn't increase in the first quarter. And in fact, what really happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence. And I think there are, I think the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to predict its path. But there are paths to not cutting and there are paths to cutting. It's really going to depend on the data. In terms of the employment mandate to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our sort of framework document says that when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one. Actually, it's the time to get back there times how far it is from the goal. And that was clearly inflation. So our focus was very much on inflation. And this is what we're referring to in the statement. As inflation has come down now to below 3% on a 12-month basis, we're now focusing the other goal, the employment goal, now comes back in to focus. And so we are focusing on it. And that's how we think about that. Yes. J. translations, financial times, thanks.",0.0014614974423794,0.0017972468548180535
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 18:55:00,2024-05-01 19:00:00," of the opportunity to ask the questions just to go back to the answer before the previous one. It seems to suggest that you think the lightliest path of inflation is one that's going to allow you to have a situation where rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now. It would be good if you could just confirm whether or not that's a correct reading. And the key one GDP printers led to some to start mentioning the term stagflation with respect to the US economy. Do you or anyone else on the FOMC think this is now a risk? Thank you. I'm not dealing really in likelihood. I think there are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts in their paths that wouldn't. And I don't have great confidence in which of those paths. I think my personal forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year. I don't know that it will be enough sufficient. I don't know that it won't. I think we're going to have to let the data lead us on that. In terms of your second question was stagflation. I guess I would say I was around for stagflation and it was 10% unemployment. It was high single digits inflation. Right now we have very slow growth. Right now we have 3% growth which is pretty solid growth I would say by any measure. We have inflation running under 3%. I don't really understand where that's coming from. In addition I would say most forecasters including our forecasting was that last year's level of growth was very high 3.4% and I guess the fourth quarter and probably not going to be sustained and would come down but that would be our forecast. That wouldn't be stagflation. That would still be to a very healthy level of growth. And of course with inflation we will return inflation to 2% and that won't be stagflation. Mike McKee from Blueberg Radio and Television. The vice chair of the FOMC said recently that he's willing to consider the idea that potential growth has moved up and of course he's Mr. potential growth R star. Do you share that view and would that imply that maybe policy isn't tight enough? I think that would take that question this way. We saw a year of very high productivity growth in 2023 and we saw a year of I think negative productivity growth in 2022. So I think it's hard to draw from the data. I mean the question is will productivity run? There are two questions. One is will productivity run persistently above its longer run trend. I don't think we know that. In terms of potential output though if that's a separate question we've had a what amounts to a significant increase in the potential output of the economy. It's not about productivity. It was about having more labor, frankly, both through in 2020 through both through participation and all this look through immigration. So we're very much like other forecasters and economists getting our arms around what that means for potential output this year and next year and last year for that matter too. So I think in that case I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output. But you've also got you so you've got more supply but those people also come in and they are they work they have jobs they spend so you've also got demand. So it may be it may be that you get more supply than you get demanded at the beginning but ultimately it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary over a over a longer period. You said earlier that at this point you're not really considering rate increases. If growth is higher but you're not considering rate increases does that imply that you're more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation taking off again? No I think we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is appropriate to the current situation. We believe it's restrictive and you know we our evidence for that I went over earlier you see in the labor market you see an inflation sensitive spending where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years and that's that's more from monetary policy whereas the supply side things that are happening are more on the supply side. So that's how we think about it. Thank you Mr. Chairman Edward Lawrence from Fox Business so GDP growth",0.0004732794320645,0.0022318783330041387
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 19:00:00,2024-05-01 19:05:00," is about 2% employment is about 4% it feels a lot like a steady state and we have 3% inflation. So if the data remains the same that you're seeing and I know you said you don't see a rate hike but it's a reason that you would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2% inflation. So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today's meeting and are you satisfied with 3% inflation for the rest of the year? Well of course we're not satisfied with 3% inflation. 3% can't be in a sentence with satisfied. So we will return inflation to 2% over time, but over time. And we think our policy stance is appropriate to do that. So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably out of 2%, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates. We don't see that, we don't see evidence for that. So that's where we are. Well the discussion, was there a discussion about a rate hike at all? So the policy focus has really been on what to do about holding the current level of restriction. That's part of the policy, the sort of the policy discussion was in the meeting. I wanted to follow on the 3%. Is there a time frame of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike? There isn't any rule you can't look to a rule. You know these are going to be judgment calls. You know clearly restrictive monetary policy needs more time to do its job. That is pretty clear based on what we're seeing. How long that will take and how patient we should be. It's going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook evolves. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Weido with Politico. You've talked about your commitment to being a political and nonpartisan. And I was just wondering given that it's an election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election. And similarly, is there a significant economic difference between starting to cut in September versus December? So we're always going to do what we think the right thing for the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it's the right thing to do for the economy. That's our record, that's what we do. We're not looking at anything else. You know, it's hard enough to get the economics right here. These are difficult things. And if we were to take on a whole other set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we'd actually get the economics right. So that's how we think about it around here. And you know, we're at peace over it. We know that we'll do what we think is the right thing when we think it's the right thing. And we'll all do that. And that's how everybody around here thinks. So I can't say it enough that we just don't go down that road. If you go down that road, where do you stop? And so we're not on that road. We're on the road where we're serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks. And then is there a significant difference between, you know, whether you start in, say, September versus December? And there's a significant difference between an institution that takes into account all sorts of political events and one that doesn't. That's where the significant difference is. And we just don't do that. I mean, you can go back and read the transcripts for every, this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here. Read all the transcripts and see if anybody mentions in any way the pending election. It just isn't part of our thinking. It's not what we're hired to do. If we start down that road, again, I don't know, I don't know how you stop. So. Summit. Thank you, Chair Powell. Question about the labor market. You've mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing. Certainly, today's Jolt State has suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre-pandemic levels. One thing that hasn't normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic. I wonder if you can share your analysis of why that's happening. Is that a lagging indicator or something else going on? So I think if you go back to where wage is peaked, wage increases peaked a couple of three years ago, essentially all wage measures have come down substantially to that. But they are not down to where they were before the pandemic. They're still roughly a percentage point higher. And we've seen pretty consistent progress, but not uniformly. And you'll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was it was expected to have come down. And essentially it was flat year over year, I think, roughly. So yeah, I mean, that part of it is bumpy. And again, we don't target wage increases. But in the longer run, if you have",-0.0012614565881542,0.0029999802632877056
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 19:05:00,2024-05-01 19:10:00," wage increases running higher than productivity would warrant. And then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures. Employers will raise prices over time if that's the case. So we've seen progress. It has been, you know, inconsistent, but we have seen a substantial decline overall. But we have ways to go on that. You were Nancy. Nancy. Sorry. Hey, Chair Powell, Nancy, Michelle Dancer from Marketplace. You mentioned consumers and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates right now. Mortgage rates are up as our rates for car loans, credit cards, people looking to borrow are very discouraged, that's reflected in their views on the economy. What would you say to them? Well, the thing that hurts everybody, and particularly people in the lower income brackets, is inflation. If you're a person who's living paycheck to paycheck, and suddenly all the things you buy, the fundamentals of life go up in price, you are in trouble right away. And so with those people in mind in particular, what we're doing is we're using our tools to bring down inflation. People will take some time, but we will succeed, and we will bring inflation back down to 2%. And then people won't have to worry about it again. That's what we're doing, and we know that it's painful and inconvenient, but the dividends will be paid and will be very large, and everyone will share in those dividends. And we've made quite a lot of progress. If you can think about it, I think, I think, headline, core PCE peaked at 5.8. Now it's at, anyway, headline peaked at 7.1. Now it's at 2.7. Don't want to get that wrong. You don't. Quick follow up. Are current interest rates really doing that much, though, to fight inflation right now for those consumers? Yes. I mean, I think that restrictive monetary policy is doing what it's supposed to do, and it's, but it's also, in this case, unusually working alongside and with the healing of the supply side. This, that was different this time, was that a big part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we're having this conversation is that we had this supply side kind of collapse with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing. And so, and this was to do with the shutting down reopening of the economy and other things that really raised demand. So many factors did that. So I think now you see those two things working together, the reversal of those supply and demand distortions from the pandemic and the response to it, along with, with restrictive monetary policy, those two things are working to bring down inflation. And we've made a lot of progress. Let's remember how far we've come. And we have a ways to go. We've got work left to do, but we're not looking at the very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago. All right. Courtney Brown from Axios. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned earlier on housing inflation. It's kind of been this long awaited disinflation and shelter that still hasn't arrived. So I guess two questions. How do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private sector data we're seeing and the government data? And how confident are you that rents will be helpful in the inflation front in the coming months? So essentially, there are a number of places in the economy where there's a, where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process. Housing is one of them. So when you have, when you, when someone goes to a new person goes to rent an apartment, that's called market rent. And you can see market rents are barely going up at all. The inflation in those has been very low. But it takes, before that, they were incredibly high. They sort of led the high part. So what happens is those market rents take years, actually, to get all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases. Landlords don't tend to charge as much of an increase to a roll over tenant for whatever reason. And what that does is it builds up a sort of an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases. And what happens is, you know, it's complicated, but the story is it just takes some time for that to get in. Now, I am confident that as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low. What will be the exact timing of it? I think we've learned that the lags are longer. We now think significantly longer.",0.0011643281431925,0.0028840645556367254
2024-05-01 18:30:00,2024-05-01 19:10:00,2024-05-01 19:15:00," than we thought at the beginning. And so confident that it will come, but not so confident in the timing of it. But yes, I expected that this will happen. Thanks. Thanks, Jizinski. Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions. This is Nicholas Jizinski from Barren's Magazine. It seems that over the past three or four years, economies and central banks in developed markets at least have been on more or less the same trajectory, easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out. It feels like that may be ending in 2024, based on some of the economic data from Europe and the US and Japan and statements from those central banks as well. So my question is, what considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central bank policies present for the FOMC? So that you're right, I think, that may happen. And you know that we all serve domestic mandates, right? So I think the difference between the United States and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they're just not having the kind of growth we're having. They have, their inflation is performing about like hours or maybe a little better, but they're not experiencing the kind of growth we're experiencing. So we actually have the luxury of having strong growth and a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job creation, and all of that. And we can be patient and we will be careful and cautious as we approach the decision to cut rates, whereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that. In terms of the implications, I think the obviously market see it coming, it's priced in now. And so I think the market's and economies can adapt to it. And I think we haven't seen, in addition for the emerging market economy, we haven't seen the kind of turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago. And that's I think partly because emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation. And so they're navigating this pretty well this time. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Seanberger with the Office of Finance. You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to encounter pain for inflation to come back down. But given sticky inflation data in the first quarter, can dissinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy, or is some softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down? So you're right. I think we thought, and most people thought there would have to be probably a significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels. It was at the beginning of this episode. That didn't happen. That's a tremendous result. We're very, of course, gratified and pleased that that hadn't happened. And if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it really was that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren't to do with monetary policy, but the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, supply problems, supply side problems, and also some demand issues as well. The unwinding of those really helped inflation come down. Now, as I've said, I'm not getting up on that. So I think it is possible that those forces will still work to help us bring inflation down. We can't be guaranteed that that's true though. And so we're trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong and the economy strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2% sustainably. We will bring inflation down to 2% sustainably. We hope we can do it without significant changes. Just locations in the labor market, where else were? And speaking of dislocations in the labor market, in terms of cutting, you said if there were weakness in the job market, that could be a reason to cut rates. So if the unemployment rate were to take above 4%, but inflation not back down to your 2% target, how would you look at that? Would the unemployment rate popping back above 4% catch your attention? You know, I said an unexpected weakening is what the way I characterize it. So, you know, and I'm not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that. But, you know, it would be, it had to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it. You know, a couple of tents in the unemployment rate would probably not do that, but a broader, would be a broader thing that would suggest that that it would be appropriate to consider cutting. And I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and circumstances, not just that one. Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with American Banker.

2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.7%, but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3% in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases, which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand, grew at 2.8% in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year's robust pace, but remains solid. And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its enemic pace last year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year's pace with a median projection of 2.1% this year and 2.0% over the next two years. In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong, but a bit below that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate ticked up, but remains low at 4%. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Non-always growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated. FOMC participants expect labor market strength to continue. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0% at the end of this year and 4.2% at the end of next year. Inflation is eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.7% over the 12 months ending in April, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE prices rose 2.8%. The consumer price index which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE price index rose 3.3% over the 12 months ending in May and the core CPI rose 3.4%. Inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected though more recently readings have eased somewhat. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6% this year, 2.3% next year and 2.0% in 2026. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year.",-0.0002765851591149,0.0018077845415975246
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:35:00,2024-06-12 18:40:00," risks to achieving armor deployment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. So far this year, they'd have not given us that greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable in earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective. We'll need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress that we've seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SCP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1% at the end of this year, 4.1% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2026. With these projections are not a committee plan or any kind of a decision, as the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. Once the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we're prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we're prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We'll continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Just wondering if you could walk me through the committee's average inflation forecast. Core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8% by the year end. It's already 2.75 and after today's number there were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month. Does that tell you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and in fact that it's going to get worse? And if you have this wrong, doesn't it mean that you sort of you could have wronged the outlook for rates there? Yeah, so what's going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half last year, June through December really. And we're now lapping those. So as you go through the 12 month window, a very low reading drops out and a new reading comes in, the new reading gets added to the 12 month window. So it's just a slight element of conservatism that we're assuming a certain level of incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers. We're assuming a good but not great numbers. And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12 month reading. Now do we have high confidence that that's right? No, it's just a kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today's reading, then of course that wouldn't be the case. So it's just a forecasting device. I think let me say that we welcome today's reading and hope for more like that. But if it comes in just to follow up, it comes in the way you forecast it. It would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE. Thank you. Yeah, no, I mean, I think we've.",0.0007003575509602,0.0024369080805657505
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:40:00,2024-06-12 18:45:00," What we said is that we don't think it will be appropriate to reduce rates and begin to lose in policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2% on a sustainable basis. And that's the test we've applied. I don't know that this rules that in or out. I mean, really, it's a forecast, a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12 months rates by the end of the year. If we get, you know, good, better ratings in that, then you will see that come down or remain the same. If you're at 2.6, 2.7, you know, that's a really good place to be. Nick. Nick, Timer, also the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, if I look at the rate projections, I see 15, the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cuts this year, fairly evenly split between the two. And so I wonder if you could explain a little bit more the nuances of the differences there. Would two or three more inflation readings, like the one that we saw this morning, make a September interest rate cut possible? So as far as the SAP part of that is concerned, as you know, I talk to all of the other participants on the FMC every cycle. We talk about their summer of economic projections and the dot plot and everything. And what I hear and see is that people are looking at a range of plausible outcomes. And in many cases, they're thinking, I can't really distinguish between two of these. They're so close for me. These are very close calls. But we ask them to write down the most likely one. So they do. And I think you've, as you've said, there's 15 of the 19 are kind of clustered around one or two. So I think I would look at all of them as plausible. But I look at, so I think that does tell you kind of what the committee thinks. But what everyone agrees on is it's going to be dated appended. No one brings to this or takes away from it that is on the committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path. It's actually just their forecast and it's a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function. But again, everyone would say that this is very dated dependent and I don't hold it with high confidence. And I think if you're looking for end and don't really think that they're not trying to send a strong signal that this is what I think is the right thing. It's just what they think at a given moment in time subject to data. In terms of future meetings, we don't try to, we don't make decisions about future meetings until we get there. I think in terms of what we need to see, I mentioned it earlier. We want to gain further confidence. Certainly more good inflation readings will help with that. I'm not going to be specific about how many because really it's going to be not just the inflation reading readings. It's going to be the totality of the data. What's happening in the labor market? What's happening with the balance of risks? What's happening with the forecast? What's happening with growth? You look at all of that and you ask, are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent? Or alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response, which is another thing that could happen? But again, we don't see that. We do see today's report as progress and as building confidence. But we don't see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant beginning to loosen policy at this time. And if I could quickly follow up, did you or any of your colleagues change your interest rate projections after 830 or whenever you got the inflation numbers today? So this happens too often, but it does happen. It just is, you know, data came. I think it happened a couple of meetings ago, a few meetings ago. So when that happens, when there's an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day, what we do is we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update, we tell them how to do that. And some people do, some people don't. Most people don't. But I'm not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that. So what's in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can reflect it in one day. I think we'll see PPI tomorrow. We'll know more about the PCE reading as the month goes on. But the initial CPI reading and it's kind of first level translation to PCE. We did have this morning. We were briefed about it and people were able to consider whether they should make changes. And as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don't.",-0.0017956462484806,0.0026774997691811388
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:45:00,2024-06-12 18:50:00," Hi Chair Powell, Janelle Marte from Bloomberg. As you noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic. I wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that. So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2% or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that many of those imbalances have eased? Sure, so by so many measures the labor market was kind of overheated two years ago. And we've seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand. So what have we seen? We've seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That's ongoing mostly now through the immigration channel, but still we've had some increases in prime age labor force. In terms of on the demand side, we've seen, well we've seen quits moving down, we've seen job openings, moving down, we've seen wage increases moving from very very high levels a couple of years ago, back down to more sustainable levels. We have seen unemployment creep up now six tents over the course of a year or so very very gradually. So we put all that together which you have is still low unemployment, still 4% unemployment historically low, but it's moved up a little bit, it's softened a bit and that's an important statistic. But more than that you've got strong job creation, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong even though there's an argument that they may be a bit overstated but still they're still they're strong. So that's what we see. We watched the labor market of course and the economy as a whole, but the labor market very carefully and that's what we see. We see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward better balance. We're monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don't see that. As a quick follow-up, the surveys that make up the job support are showing different tales. There's been some divergent, especially we saw in the last report that we got on Friday. So how do you interpret that and how does it change your view on the labor market? So sometimes you can't reconcile the differences. You just have to have to look at it and try to understand and that's why it always makes sense to look at a series in three, six and 12 months of things rather than just one report, but you're right to point to the last report where your job losses and household survey, job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey. So we're left with ambiguous results and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling, gradually rebalancing labor market. Job openings while they've come way down are still greater than the number of unemployed people. The job's workers gap is still a significantly positive number greater than it was before the pandemic. So overall we're looking at what is still a very strong labor market, but not the superheated labor market of two years ago, or even one year ago. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Back on the rates path, the SEP showed quite large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March. That's a period in which the economic data flow hasn't been that dramatic a shift. How can you provide some color on what changed attitudes on the committee of the last three months to see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year? Yeah, the big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the inflation forecast moved up several tents for the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier in the what did we take away from this? We had really, really good inflation data in the second half of last year than kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter. And what we took away from that was that it's probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to lose in policy. So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in, might have taken place this year, take place next year. You know, we, we, there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there's one more next year. So you really, if you look at year end 2025 and 26, you're almost exactly where you would have been, just it just it's moved later because of that progress. Now you get another, you get data, different data today. So we'll have to see where the data light the way. You know, we're, we're, we're, the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions. And today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected. And we'll just have to see what, what, what the incoming data flow brings in and how that affects the outlook and the balance of risks.",-0.000590395011162,0.001588356973995087
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:50:00,2024-06-12 18:55:00," Thank you for taking our questions. In the summary of economic projections, the long run interest rate forecast moved up a bit. I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not restrictive as we previously expected. How should we interpret what that means about how the committee views its current policy setting? So two things about that. One is this. You're right, it did move up. But I want to remember to point out that long run neutral rate of interest is a long run concept. It really is a theoretical concept, can't be directly observed. And what it is is the interest rate they would hold the economy at equilibrium, maximum employment, and price stability, potentially years in the future, where there are no shocks. So it's a little bit. It's not something we observed today. We've got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks. We're still getting over from the pandemic. So I don't think that the concept of our starts very important concept in economics and in what we do. But honestly, it doesn't really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term. But back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren't going to are less likely to go down to their pre-pandemic levels, which were very low by recent history measures. Now, we can't really know that. That's an interesting dispute and discussion to have now. But ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer run slow moving forces. And there's a really good question about whether those really have changed or whether instead rates and the economy are experiencing a series of persistent, but ultimately temporary shocks. That's been the debate. And we can't know. But in the meantime, we're making policy with the economy that we have, with the distortions that we have. And I also, to your other point, I think it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of how restrictive as policy has become one that everyone's asking. And we're asking it too. And my answer has been that policy is restrictive. The question of whether it's sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we know over time. But I think for the reasons I talked about the last press conference and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having the effects that we would hope for. Well, thanks, your pal. Howard Stein with the writers. Just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion, the combination of tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to market on the level of restrictiveness that you need, that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren't quite there yet? I'd be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion. I think this is about looking at the incoming data and asking how much progress are we making on inflation and how is the rest of the economy doing? Is the labor market still strong? That's what we're thinking about. You know, you can translate it into the language you're talking about. But to me, the focus is more on we have a goal, which is price stability, another goal, which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we've got a good, strong labor market still. We think we've been making progress toward the price stability goal. And then for a while, there was a pause and we look at today's thing and we think, well, that's a good reading and we hope we get more like that. And in the meantime, we're asking is our policy stance about right? And I think we think, yes, it's about right. We're prepared to adjust it as appropriate, but we think we're getting the things that we would want to get broadly speaking. And that's why we've been into policy right now for almost a year. So just to follow up on that, I think what curious thing here is you've got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the major things for all of this year. You've got growth that stays above long run potential throughout the forecast period. Unemployment that never goes above the long run estimate of 4.2. So this isn't a story of slack improving inflation. So where's the improvement in inflation coming from that it's going to pick up pace so much in 2025? Well, it's been coming, where's it been coming from? We'll start with that. Clearly, some of what we've been getting is just the reversal of the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand. And that is complemented by an amplified, supported by restrictive monetary policy. So those two things have been working together. We've also had a very positive supply shock.",-4.615058011295991e-05,0.0018293358956354801
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:55:00,2024-06-12 19:00:00," on the labor side and also you get a positive supply shock when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal. So you've had above trend potential growth and at high growth and yet you've had the benefit of inflation coming down, you know, really fast actually last year and you will see what the rest of this year brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. I mean, ultimately the question is ultimately, are you down to demand? We don't know that though. I mean, we're looking at today's report, you know, if we see more like that, you know, we can't know what the future holds. But in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and television. The base case of the committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but your growth forecast doesn't see any slow down in the rest of the year. Nor does the unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market. And your inflation forecast basically average out to no change. So if at the end of the year there is no change from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates? What would be the point for a rate cut? And we think policy is restrictive. And we think ultimately that if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy. So that's always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise rates this far, we've always been pointing to cuts at a certain point, not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but no one has that as their base case. So no one on the committee does. So that's how we think about it. And that's what we've been getting. That's what we've been getting is good progress on inflation with growth at a good level, and with a strong labor market. Now ultimately, we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far, they haven't had to. And that's why we're watching so carefully for signs of weakness. We don't really see that. We want to see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling and demand, gradual rebalancing in the labor market while we're continuing to make progress on inflation. So we're getting good results here. To follow up, is there any kind of concern for the housing industry or financial stability banks in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point? On housing, you know, the housing situation is a complicated one. And you can see that's a place where rates are really having a significant effect. I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize. There will still be a national housing shortage as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one. But the distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that, you know, low mortgages. In terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well-capitalized, lending. You know, we've seen good performance by the banks. We had the turmoil early at last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up their capital and having risk management plans in place. So the banking system, you know, seems to be, seems to be in good shape. Chris. Thanks. Chris Regaber at Associated Press. I was wondering if we can read on inflation. If you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy, you mentioned labor markets coming into better balance and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. You're seeing, you know, anecdotal stories of the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts, McDonald's announcing a $5 meal deal. So, you know, people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store, but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy. And I wonder if you could tell us more about it. So I think that's true. That inflationary pressures have come down, but we still have, we're still getting high inflation reading. So, you know, and I think you can see it in various places, you know, in some parts of non-housing services, you see elevated inflation still, and that's probably to do with, it could be to do with wages. Goods prices have kind of fluctuated. There's been a surprising increase in import prices on goods, which is kind of hard to understand. And, you know, may, may, we've taken some signal from that, but, you know, and of course, housing services, you're seeing, you're continuing to see high readings there to some extent that's, you know, catch up inflation from earlier pressures. But, I mean, overall, you're...",0.0015322982627799,0.0022066902416280573
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 19:00:00,2024-06-12 19:05:00," Right, inflationary pressures have come down. As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance. Wages are still running, I would say, above a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity. You're still seeing wage increases moving above that. We haven't thought of wages as being the principle cause of inflation, but at the same time getting back to 2% inflation is likely to require return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking your questions. There's obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected this year, but can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do to the economy, what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end of the year or even two? I think if you look back in five or ten years and try to pull out the significance to the US economy of 125-based point rate cut, you'd have quite a job on your hands. So that's not how we look at it. Really, the whole rate path matters, and I do continue to think that when we do start to lose in policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions, and the market will price in what it prices in. I have no way of saying we're not at that stage, so I don't know what we'll be thinking about at that time. But it's a consequential decision for the economy, and you want to get it right. And fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we have the ability to approach this question carefully, and we will approach it carefully. While we're very much keeping an eye on downside economic risks, should they emerge? And you've been talking about this clear sense that it's just going to take longer to have the confidence that's needed for rate cuts, is there something about what happened in the first couple months of the year that you're seeing differently now with more time or hindsight? Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year? You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we don't like and just make it go away. But we had a quarter where inflation was running higher, and yes, I could stand here and say, it's stuff we shouldn't have taken signal from, but it is what it is. You have to, you know, low inflation is low inflation high, so if you have a quarter where it's higher, we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month and we said, okay, the signal we're taking is that, you know, we think it's going to take longer to get confidence that inflation is moving sustainably on 2%. That's what we said. I think that was the right thing to do. I still think that's the right thing to do. Now we have today's inflation reading, which is very different, very much more positive. We're going to have to see what the trend is, what's going to be the data going forward. We're looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And readings like today, you know, that's a step in the right direction, but you know, one reading isn't, it's just, it's the only one reading you don't want to be too motivated by any single data point. Jolene. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I'm Jolene Ken with CBS News. What's your message to Americans who are seeing, encouraging economic data, but don't feel good about this economy? I, you know, I don't think anyone knows, has a definitive answer why people are not as happy about the economy as they might be. And we don't tell people how they should think or feel about the economy. That's not our job. You know, people experience what they experience. All I can tell you is what the data show, which is we've got an economy that's growing at a solid pace. We've got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4%. It's been a long time since we've had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at a below 4% very long time. We had a period of high inflation. We now, inflation has come down really significantly and we're doing everything we can to, you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability. We're confident that we'll get there. And in the meantime, you know, it's going to be painful for people, but the ultimate pain would be a period of long, a long period of high inflation. It is people who lower income people, people who put the margins of the economy who have the worst experience, who experience the most pain from inflation. So, you know, it's for those people for all Americans, but particularly for those people that we're doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control. As just a quick follow up here, you've indicated one interest rate cut sometime this year. And I know you don't have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very...",0.0006451612903226,0.0016223590575568665

Well, you know, I don't have a precise date for you, but what we said is that we want to make sure that we're confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2%. And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy. So having that kind of confidence, the inflation will be at 2%. It just pays benefits to the whole economy to all Americans for a long period of time. We had that period for a very long time. We very much want to get back to a place where people cannot think about inflation. It's just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make. We were there for a long time, and our goal is to get back to that place. And we've made good progress, and we're in the phase now of just sticking with it until we get it done. Claire. Claire Jones, financial times. I'm just drawing on the change and the statement on the being more disfur the progress on inflation. Halfway through the year and after today's CPI release, what have you and other committee members found that has been particularly encouraged into you? And just in terms of the conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular? Thank you. So encouraging has been that growth, you know, the growth clearly that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see still strong growth, solid growth this year. That's been very encouraging. If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and recession. Many forecasters had that. And that's not what happened. Instead, we got the U.S. is anyway, and it's in its in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the world. So that's been encouraging. I would say that today's inflation report is encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging. You ask about, your second question was really about shelter inflation. So I think if you go back a couple of years, we know that there were renters, and then there are, you know, people who own their houses, and we have OER, which is, when there's a equivalent rent. And so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the economy reopen, they really went up sharply. Those play into role-over rents much more slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants. And so what we found now that there are big lags, so there's sort of a bulge of high past increases in market rents that has to get worked off, and that may take, you know, several years. Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain going up at relatively low levels, and they still are, you know, this is just going to happen, and it's just going to happen more slowly than we thought. You know, we also do sort of this thing where we impute rental value to owned homes, and that's, you know, many countries around the world do that. Some do it differently than us. It's something that the price experts have regularly looked at. It is not something that we're the only country that does, and it's not something we're looking at changing, or we'd look at changing, you know, anytime soon. But it's true. It's one of the very hardest things in inflation, and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services that someone is getting by living at home, that they could rent, but they're actually living in it. And some countries should just ignore that, but that's not our, that's not how we do inflation here. We do it the way we do it, and we've been very transparent about it, and, you know, it's true that we're seeing delays in realizing what's happening economically. But we understand that, you know, we understand that very well. Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business. Thank you for taking the question, Chair Files. So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer. The last jobs report showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs. That's up 8.2% and since January of 2021, we've seen prices rise 19%. So people are using their credit cards to pay for their lifestyle. What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending? So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more, you know, we're seeing is basically spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year.",0.0001565608192736,0.0012719128463196388
2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 19:10:00,2024-06-12 19:15:00," year, so last year rather. And so what that you'd expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards that it that has been happening. Credit card balances have been going up. Credit card defaults have been going up. They're not at high levels. We remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up. They couldn't spend money. They couldn't go out to spend money. They could spend money from home. But households were in very, very strong, historically strong financial shape. They've now worked off a lot of that. So we're watching that carefully. And what do we see? That's what we see. We see the same data that everybody else sees. But you still got household sector that's in pretty good shape. But nonetheless, it's not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago. And we're carefully watching that. So how close then are we to that point where the consumer can't continue to spend as a spending or companies can't hire? Like they're hiring. Consumer spending is still growing. It's not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago. But it's still growing solidly. And by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up spending on equipment and intangibles has picked up quite a bit in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech plants. So overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth and something around 2%, which is a good pace of growth for the U.S. economy. Now, you're right, though. We do see the same thing other people see, which is increasing financial pressures on more lower income people. And the best thing we can do is to foster a very strong jobs economy, which we think we have done ultimately to get inflation under control because those people experience inflation very directly, very painfully. And once we get inflation under control, rates can come down, which will also improve. Thanks. Hi, Victoria Aguida with Politico. You've mentioned that unexpected weakening in the labor market would bring rate cuts sooner. And I was just wondering, can you talk a little bit about what that would look like? Is it more of a quicker pace of people losing jobs? Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to start to go above 4.2 or something like that? How are you thinking about what you're looking for to see the job market unexpectedly weakened? When I say unexpectedly, the first thing is more than kind of is in our forecast or in common forecasts. So something more than that. But we'll be looking at everything. The labor market has the ability, has the tendency sometimes to move to weaken quickly. So waiting for that to happen is not what we're doing. We're watching very carefully. We're looking at the balance of risks. I always point out the balance of risks. And also the fact that we look at all of the whole situation. So a decision to begin to lose in policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time. But we monitor all the labor market data. And if we saw troubling weakening more than expected, then that would be something we'd consider responding to. But we look at the broader context of what's going on too. So something like negative payroll numbers would be? I'm not going to, I mean, I can think of things that would, many things would make it on that list. But I don't think I'll butter them here. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Urbinevich with the Economist. May I ask you mentioned with the slightly higher PC readings earlier this year that it wasn't one or two months, but three months that tipped you to be a bit more cautious in the rate outlook. Should we take from that that, you know, it looks like May will be quite good for PC as it was for CPI? Does that imply that kind of two more good months would reensteal the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently project? You know, I don't actually have that kind of mechanical thing in my thinking. I get that, you know, as many good ones as we had bad ones, but it's not like that. It's the whole, it's going to be the totality of the data. Labor market data, the growth data, in terms of inflation, you know, you'd want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we are a path down to 2%. And I don't want to try to give you specific numbers of things because that points to a date. And I just don't think we're not at a point in being able to do that. Thank you for doing this. I'm Kostya Takami with an EK. I would like to know about the impact of stronger dollar on US economic growth and prices. And I have no",0.0007827536351998,0.0012713503952240357

So I want to know if it is having a positive impact on US economy in total. Thank you. So we don't actually, it's our finance ministry, the Treasury Department, that has a responsibility for thinking about and if it sees fit, doing things about the level of the dollar. So for us, it's just another financial variable and you write the dollar has exhibited some strength over the course of the last year or so because the US economy is very strong. We don't think of it as benefiting or hurting the US. We don't, again, we don't manage the level of the dollar that's not our job. It's not, you know, for our economy, what we're trying to foster is maximum employment and price stability and we feel like we've made good progress on both of those goals over the course of the past year. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair. Apalegina for John Berger with Yahoo Finance. You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2%. Your forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8% on Core PCE or at 2.8% of course on Core PCE. Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got 2.6 to 2.7 on PCE, that would be a good place to be. You also indicated the job market has mostly normalized. So why not cut rates this summer just once? You're well above neutral to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long and the quest for confidence for inflation. You know, so we are well aware of the two-sided risks here. Let me just say we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion. We understand that if we move too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we've done and have to then start over and it could be very disruptive. So we're extremely aware of both of those risks and just basically trying to manage them. What we said is that we don't think it will be appropriate to begin to loosen policy until we're more confident that inflation is moving down to 2% over time on a sustainable basis. That's kind of been our test or there's another test which is an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions. So I think that's the right way for us to think about it. That's our dual mandate there. And you know, we have a strong economy. We've got growth, all forecasts are very commonly around 2%. That's a strong growth rate for our economy. The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate and employment is still low. So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully and that's what we're doing. Just to follow, Chair Powell, do you need to be ahead of a weakening in the labor market otherwise is it too late given that the labor market is a lagging indicator, right? When you look at the monthly jobs data. We completely understand that that's the risk and that's not what we're, that's not our plan. It's to wait for things to break and then try to fix them. We're trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework and we think we're doing that. Thank you, Chair Powell. I'm a advisor with Market News International. You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year. At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that? Who will lead it? Will it be you or a member, a committee group of your peers? What will be the parameters? Do you anticipate the review will consider changes, communications going forward? So what we've been thinking is that we would announce and commence the review later or later in the year. In the meantime, as that time approaches, we will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it. Within scope would certainly be communications generally. I'm not going to say that we'll look at this or that particular thing and all the other details. We don't want to get prematurely into a conversation until it's really time to have it. So I'm going to leave pretty much everything else to later in the year. Good and Nancy, for the last question. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, Gensar with Marketplace. Just one more question on housing. It still cuts rates with shelter prices high.",0.0008281497294711,0.0012333406965612972

There isn't any one thing, one variable like housing prices, moderating that would really decide or decide against what we're doing. We've got an overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustainable basis. That's our overall test. Or alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market. So those are two different tests. I would say, you know, we're not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying that's the one. We don't target housing prices, for example. And we don't target wages. We target aggregate prices and overall employment. But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow down the pace of rate cuts? I think you look at the over. We'll be looking at the aggregate numbers and asking ourselves what's going on here with inflation at the aggregate level. And of course, if any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would matter, any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter too. But I wouldn't single out housing as having a special role there. Thank you very much.",-0.0029697326321209,0.0035411287347841365
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance and the unemployment rate remains low. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.5%. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. We are attentive to risks on both sides of our dual mandate and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP growth moderated to 2.1% in the first half of the year, down from 3.1% last year. Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP, which excludes inventory investment government spending and net exports and usually sends a clear signal of underlying demand, grew at a 2.6% pace over that same period of the first half. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year's robust pace but remains solid. Investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investments installed in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Pay roll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter, a solid pace but below that scene in the first quarter. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.1%. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration. Now normal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic. Strong but not overheated. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.5% over the 12 month ending in June, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 2.6%. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As the labor market has cooled, inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance. Indeed, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. We have stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. The second quarters inflation readings have added to our confidence and more good data would further strengthen that confidence. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully",0.0010164077246986,0.0010164077246986086
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:35:00,2024-07-31 18:40:00," incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor market were too weakened unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well-anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Gina. Gina's my look from the New York Times. I wonder if you think that's a reasonable expectation and if so, why not just make the move today? Thank you. So on September, let me say this, we have made no decisions about future meetings and that includes the September meeting. The broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate. In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent so it will not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases. The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook in the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market. If that test is met, the reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September. So you asked why not today and I would just say again that the broad sense of the committee is that we're getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reuse our policy rate but that we're not quite at that point yet. So just to follow up on that a bit, if inflation behaves as you expect between now in September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now? So I guess I would think about it this way. I'll give an example of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe it wouldn't be appropriate to cut. So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or less in line with expectations, growth remains, let's say, reasonably strong. And the labor market remains consistent with its current condition then. I would think that a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting. If inflation were to prove stickier and we were to see higher reading, some inflation disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things. I think it's going to be not just any one thing, it's going to be the inflation data, it's going to be the employment data, it's going to be the balance of risks as we see it. And the total of all of that that help us make this decision. And just to follow up on that, specifically in what ways right now, given all you've seen over the last few months in particular, on shelter, on services, et cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to 2%. I think it's just a question of seeing more good data. We have seen the last couple of readings have certainly added to confidence and we've seen progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation. That's goods, non-housing services and housing services. So it's really just, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at the beginning of the year then we saw some more good inflation data. We had seven months at the end of last year. We just want to see more and gain confidence. And as I said, we did gain confidence and more good data would cause us to gain more confidence. Thank you. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. The March SCP pointed to three cuts in 2024 with core inflation at 2.6% and the unemployment rate at 4%. Since we're now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was projected for the labor market.",-0.0015224838236094,0.001870007262164282
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:40:00,2024-07-31 18:45:00," I'm just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best guidepost for policy rather than let's say the shallower one lead out in the June SEP. You know, so I would just say really the path ahead is going to depend on the way the economy evolves. And I can't really give you any better forward guidance on it than that. We didn't, of course, do an SEP at this meeting. We will do another one at the September meeting. I would just say I can imagine a scenario in which there would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts depending on the way the economy evolves. And I wouldn't want to lay out a baseline path for you there today. I've said what I can say about September and about today though. Nick Timmerle, so the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you've said before that you wouldn't wait until inflation got to 2% to cut rates because of how inflation is lagged. Does that apply for the labor market too? If the labor market is back in equilibrium, why is restrictive policy and potentially very restrictive policy given the high real funds rate warranted right now? So this is the very reason that we're thinking about, you know, that we've said in our statement that we're going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the risks are coming back into balance. We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is an ongoing gradual normalization of labor market conditions. And that's what we want to see. You know, we've seen that a period of a couple of years and a move really from overheated conditions to more normal conditions. We are watching the labor market conditions quite closely and that's what we're seeing if we start to see something that looks to be more than that, then we're well positioned to respond. That's part of what we're thinking. And when you talk about seeing something that's more than whatever softest or slow down you expect. In the past, you've said that stronger growth wouldn't override better news on inflation. I wonder how that cuts the other way. If you're seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change the calculus on what you're looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy? We have growth isn't one of our three. We have two mandates. As you know, the labor market maximum employment is one in stable prices is another. So we weigh those two things equally under the law. When we were far away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that. Now we're back to a closer to even focus. So we'll be looking at the labor market conditions and asking whether we're getting what we're seeing. And as I said, we're prepared to respond if we see it that it's not what we wanted to see, which was a gradual normalization of conditions if we see more than that. And it wouldn't be any one statistic, although of course the unemployment rate is generally thought to be a good single statistic, but we'd be looking at wages, we'd be looking at participation, we'd be looking at all the things, surveys, quits, hires, all of those things to determine the overall status of the labor market. But we're looking at it now. I would say again, I think you're back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions. And that was not an inflationary economy, broadly similar labor markets then. I think inflation was actually core inflation is actually running below 2%. So we don't think I don't now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary pressures. So I would not like to see material further cooling in the labor market. And that's part of what's behind our thinking. The other part of course is that we have made real progress on inflation. And we've got growing confidence there that we are not quite there yet, but we're getting more confident that we're on a sustainable path. Down to 2% so those things are working together and we're factoring those both into our policy. Chris. Chris, we're a Gaber, an associate in press. You mentioned not wanting to see any further cooling in the job market. Why not? Or would you consider preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling? Is that something you would cut ahead of time for? So I wouldn't say I wouldn't want to see any other cooling. It would be more material difference. If we be looking at this and if we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to. So in terms of, I don't think of it that way. I think of it as, you know, we're actually in a good place here. We're balancing these two risks of, you know, go too soon and you undermine progress.",0.0006710557338992,0.0008162673003320312
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:45:00,2024-07-31 18:50:00," on inflation wait too long or don't go fast enough and you put at risk the recovery. And so we have to balance those two things. That's the nature of having two mandates. And I think this is how we balance them. It's a rough balance, but it does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it's in a place where it's just a process of ongoing normalization. 4.1% unemployment is still historically low. And we'll just have to see what the data show us. And just to follow up quickly, wanted to see what you thought of the recent Joltz report which did show hiring, gross hiring has come down even below 2019 levels. Layoffs remain low. So a painted picture of a very statically remarked is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying? Thank you. So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the direction we would want to see. So that was taken as there was a decline in job openings that was good. Today's ECI reading was a little softer than expected. So that's a good reading. It shows that wage increases are still at a strong level, but that that level continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time. That's exactly the pattern that we want to be seeing. So I think the data, we've been seeing in the labor market are broadly consistent with that normalization process. Again, we're closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it's more than that. Steve? Steve Lee's been CNBC. Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked about cutting rates as a process. And in June, you talked about the idea that well, one rate cut wouldn't do anything. So one of you can sort of follow up on Kobe's question. Talk about are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate cuts? Talk us through the process that you think, or is it just one rate cut? Are you in the process now thinking that rates need to be normalized here? Thank you. Yeah, I can't really say that, honestly. We've seen significant movement in the labor market. And we're very mindful of this question. Is it just normalization or is it more? We think it's just more normalization, but we want to be in a position to support the labor market. At the same time, we're seeing progress on inflation. So we actually got to this. We raised rates a year ago at the July meeting. And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment, sorry, inflation was over 4%. It was a completely different economy. Now we've made a lot of progress in the labor market, as I think unemployment was in the threes, mid threes. So it's a different economy. And I think it's coming to be time to adjust that so that we support this continued process. The thing we're trying to do is you know that we have, we've had this really significant decline in inflation. And unemployment has remained low. And this is a really unusual and historically, and usually, and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve. Well, we're thinking about all the time is how do we keep this going? And this is part of that. We don't need to be 100% focused on inflation because of the progress we've made. 12-month headline at 2.5, core 2.6. You know, it's way down from where it was. The job is not done on inflation, but nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the restriction in our policy rate. And I think we're just as part of a process. In terms of what that looks like, I mean, I think most rate, you would think in a base case that policy rates would move down from here. But I don't want to try to give specific, you know, forward guidance about when that might be because the pace at which it might happen. Because I think that's really going to depend on the economy. And that's highly uncertain. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell of Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum with a few bumps in between? Would you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year? Actually, what we're seeing now is a little better than what we saw last year. Last year, as we pointed out, late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last year was from goods prices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an unsustainable rate. This is a broader disinflation. This has goods prices coming down, but we're also now seeing progress in the other two big categories, non-housing services and housing services. So the thing is, you've got one quarter of that. We had seven months of low inflation. You've got one quarter of this. I would say the quality of this is higher, and it's good, but so far it's only...",-3.601809954752382e-05,0.0005976420305341488
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:50:00,2024-07-31 18:55:00," quarter. So I think, you know, we need to see more to know that we're, you know, that we have more confidence that we're on on a good path down to 2%. But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we've been getting good data. And things like the ECI report and frankly, the softening in the labor market conditions, you know, give you more confidence that the economy's not overheating. It doesn't look like an overheating economy. And it looks like an economy that's normalizing. And if we were to think about the first couple of months of the year, was there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate cuts as were some of the projections going into 2020 more? So the thing about if that's, if what it is is seasonality and it could just be, it's very, very hard to, you know, to, to, to appropriate seasonal adjustments. If that's what it is, then that actually implies that, that other months were under reporting to low inflation. If you smooth it out, you know, it's zero sum gain. And that's why we look at 12 months. We look at 12 months because that, that takes all that out, all those fix out. 12 month now is two and a half percent headline, 2.6 percent core. This is so much better than where we were even a year ago. It's a lot better. Now, we're, the job is not done. I want to stress that and we're committed to getting job inflation sustainably onto 2 percent. But we need to take note of that progress. And we need to weigh the risk to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more equally than we did a year ago. Michael McKee. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and television. I'd like to ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it. At this point is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices. Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down? I think that we've been given an assignment by Congress. This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment and price stability. And so in our quasi-constitutional document that stay amounted longer on goals and monetary policy strategy, we look at the two goals and if one of them is farther away than the other, the two variables, inflation and employment, if one is farther away from its goal than the other, you concentrate on the one that's farther away and you take the time to reach the goal. So for the last couple of years, the best service we could do to the American people was to focus on inflation. But as inflation has come down, and I think the upside risks to inflation have decreased as the labor market has cooled off. And now the labor market is softened. Probably the inflation is probably a little farther from its target than is the employment. But I think the downside risks to the employment mandate are real now. So we have to weigh all that. And if you think about where that takes this, is we have a restrictive policy rate. It's clearly restrictive. It's been the rate we've had in place for a four year. And the time is coming, as other central banks around the world are facing the same question, the time is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions, restrictions so that we may address both mandates. Well, you have event risk basically with the jobs report on Friday and another one before you meet again. Are you certain that you won't fall behind the curve and lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September? Certainty is not a word that we have in our business. So we get a lot of data between now and September. And it isn't going to be one data reader or even two. It's going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just it. And then how is that affecting the outlook and how is it affecting the balance of risks? That's going to be the assessment that we do. Of course, we'll all look carefully at the employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and the September meeting and we'll make a judgment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence, the Fox Business. I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and Nick were asking. There's a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs. Looking at the jobs sides, we've seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing. We're hearing on earnings calls from companies like Intel, abrupt layoffs. And the jobs report from the BLS government jobs has been a leading creator. Could the government jobs as a sector hiring mask underlying weakness in the jobs report? Well, you know, we'll look at everything. We've seen some tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we've had some months where job creation was broader. And also, you know, that",0.0001446105457239,0.0006147392782236171
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 18:55:00,2024-07-31 19:00:00," the headline number of jobs has come down. So, you know, we would, but you look at the whole thing and I think you do look at private demand extra carefully to your point about government. So we'll just be looking at all those things. So as a follow-up then, so could the Fed then be behind the curve? Because you said some of the reports last meeting, you said the reports could be noisy or overstated. Was there a discussion of what kind of discussion was there for a cut today? And could the Fed be behind the curve? So, look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right? It's the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late. We've been, you know, we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year. We said we wanted to see more. We said that we pointed out that the too much of this was coming from goods and sure enough, the first quarter wasn't great inflation data. Now we've got another quarter that is good. And, you know, we're balancing the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late. That's what we're doing. There's no guarantee in this. It's a very difficult judgment call, but this is how we're making it. But in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a, you know, we had a nice conversation about this issue today. The overall sense of the committee, as I mentioned, is that we're getting closer to the point at which it'll be appropriate to begin to dial back restriction for not quite at that point yet. We want to see more good data. The decision was unanimous. All 19 participants supported it. And, but, you know, there was a real discussion back and forth of what the case would be for moving at this meeting. You know, a strong majority supported moving, not moving at this meeting. That was a strong sense of the committee, but it's a conversation that we had today, certainly. Courtney. Courtney Brown from Axios, thank you for taking our questions. When the Fed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and variable lags. I wonder if that applies on the way down to, how are you in the committee thinking about that? Yes, it does. And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the last six months, by the way. You really do now see the restriction. Whereas I mean, even a few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was. Look at the labor market now. You can see and look at inflation, sorry, rate-sensitive, intracensitive spending. You really do see now that policy is restricted. I wouldn't say it's extremely restrictive, but it's certainly effectively restrictive. Yes, the lag should be on the way down. It should take some time to get into, to get into the full economy, affect financial conditions, and that affects economic activity, hiring, and that kind of thing, and ultimately inflation. It doesn't, it's not instantaneous. Although it's faster than it used to be, because markets move now in anticipation of our moves. So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long and variable lags, even when you're lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the Fed to help stave off any kind of slow down in the labor market or broader economy? We have to worry about that. I mean, you're just to make it clear, it's a very difficult challenging judgment. And we didn't want to go too soon. We don't want to go too late. And, but this is how we've made that judgment. I feel good about where we are. We're certainly very well positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at 5.3%. We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness. That's not what we're seeing though. What we're seeing, look at the first half growth numbers. Look at PDFP at 2.6% for the first half. It's not signaling the weak economy. It's also not signaling an overheating economy. Labor market admittedly, the unemployment rate has moved up 7.10s. And we're seeing normalization there. But wage increases are still at a high level. Unemployment is still at a low level. Layoffs are very low. Initial claims have moved up, but they're pretty stable. And they're historically not high at all. So the total scope of the data suggests a normalizing labor market. And again, we are carefully watching to see that that continues to be the case. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we know with Politico. On the labor market, I was wondering how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the SOM rule? And would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates? We, so I would just say the question really is one of, are we worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market? And the answer is we're watching really carefully for that. We're aware of that rule, which is really a, you know, a.",-0.0006329342833375,0.0007690985260452131

It's not like an economic rule where it's telling you something must happen. So again, what do we see? What are our eyes telling us? We look at all the things we're seeing and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market. Again, job creation at a pretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level, but coming down gradually, job vacancies have come down, but they're still high by historical standards. So again, I've been through some of the data already, but what we think we're seeing is a normalizing labor market. And we're watching carefully to see if it turns out to be more, it starts to show signs that it's more than that. Then we're well positioned to respond. Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave differently this time than it has historically? I think history doesn't repeat itself. It rhymes. That statement is very true about the economy. You never assume it's going to be just the same. An example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies? There are many, many examples. So it's never exactly the same. Also, let's remember that this pandemic era has been won in which so many apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve for starters. So many, many pieces of received wisdom just haven't worked. And it's because the situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of admittedly, very strong demand. So the whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation or downturns that we've seen or business cycles that we've seen. So we're having to learn, you know, we're having to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say. So we don't assume that these regularities will just repeat themselves automatically. Thank you, Chair Powell and Mara, Moque with Bloomberg. But there seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the very recent downbeat pagebook and the hard data. Do you take those anecdotes seriously? That is that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what's shown in the data? So I do take that seriously and the pagebook is great. What's even greater is hearing the Reserve Bank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with businesses, business leaders and workers and people in on a private sector in their districts. But it's out there. It's a pretty, you know, the picture is not one of a slowing or, you know, a really bad economy. It's one of their spots of weakness and their regions where it grows stronger than other regions. But overall, it's, you know, again, look at the aggregate data. Agri data is, you know, particularly PDFP, the private, the private domestic final purchase is 2.6%. And that's a good indicator of private, a private demand. So we listened to all of that and it does, it does. I think it's important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data, especially, you know, it's very hard. GDP data can be volatile, quarter to quarter. So it's just hard to measure economic activity. There are a lot of, it's just difficult to do. So I look at both. But I wouldn't say that the, that the anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat. It's more mixed. Thank you. Jolene Kent with CBS News. Chair Powell, thanks for taking our questions today. You have consistently said that the Fed does not consider politics and making decisions. With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two months before the election. And former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so close to the election is something the central bank knows they shouldn't be doing. What's your response? And do you believe it's possible to really remain a political with a September rate cut? I absolutely do. And I think it's, first of all, we haven't made any decisions. I would say it this way. Haven't made any decision about any future meeting. I don't know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy. I really don't know. I do know how we will make that assessment. That's what I do know. So if you take a step back, the current situation again is inflation has come down much closer to our goal. And that's happened while unemployment has remained low. We're very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing. That's at each of our meetings and all of our decisions are focused strictly on that and really on nothing.",0.0002169785733658,0.000750777914465525

We follow academics. We follow the many commentators who bless us with their commentary. But we don't change anything in our approach to address other factors like the political counter. Congress says we believe ordered us to conduct our business in a non-political way at all times, not just some of the time. I'll say this too. We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician, or any political outcome. The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans. If we get it right, the economy will be stronger. We'll have price stability. People will find jobs, wages will rise in real terms. Everyone will benefit. So that's what we believe, and that's how we will always act. This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed. I can tell you this is how we think about it. This is what we do. So it's anything that we do before, during, or after the election, will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks, and not on anything else. Just a quick follow-up. Do your economic forecasts and models take into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harrison Trump, and if so, how? No, we do not do that. We absolutely do not do that. We don't know who's going to win. We don't know what they're going to do. We don't act as though we know, and we just can't do that. We basically, we have our forecast. We're not. We can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn't happened yet. We would just, that would just be a line we would never cross. We're a non-political agency. We don't want to be involved in politics in any way, so we wouldn't do that. Nicholas. Thank you, Chair Powell. Nicholas Janski from Barron's Magazine. There hasn't been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time. If the data do evolve, as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September? Are there meaningful differences in committee members' assessments of how much more confidence is needed? So there's always meaningful differences that there are. And we talk a lot before, during and after the meeting, we do have a very robust discussion of these things. You're right that in most cases, people, if they feel heard and they feel that their position has been given serious consideration for most people most of the time, that's going to be enough. There are dissents. That's fine. No one has a veto. No single person has a veto. So it just is a question of who will vote for and against. We've had dissents. We haven't had so many during the pandemic era. And it just may be that we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get things right. But before the pandemic, we had plenty of dissents. And you know, dissents happen. It's part of the process. There's nothing wrong with dissents. And if it happens, it happens. Jane. Hello, Jean Young with M&I Market News. Is a 50 basis point cut as a first cut at all likely or even on the table? Thank you. You know, I don't want to say, and it would be really specific about what we're going to do. But that's not something we're thinking about right now. Jennifer. Of course, I haven't made any decisions at all as of today. Thank you, Chair Belgenner for Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. Not to get into the minutes, but you said there was a real discussion today for moving at this meeting. I'm curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September. Well, so the way the meeting is set up, the first day, there's a discussion of financial stability because it's every other meeting we have. And then we have an opportunity to comment on that. Then we have an economic go-around. And then this morning, we have the monetary policy go-around. And I think in people's economic go-around, and in their monetary policy go-around, people express their views about this. And there's a range of views. People, as you will know, from the speeches that they give, people have different ways of thinking about the economy. And so in the minutes, we'll get to the next.",0.0002534762456546,0.0006518314653533717
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 19:10:00,2024-07-31 19:15:00," We'll lay this at a much better way than I can do off the cuff. But there's a range of perspectives. But I do think that we are a consensus driven organization. People come together. This was a unanimous decision. And at the end, everyone supported the outcome, not just the voters, but everyone. So I would also say some people examine the possibility, the case for moving at this meeting. But overwhelmingly, the sense of the committee was not at this meeting. But as soon as the next meeting, depending on how the data come in. But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could move at the next meeting, assuming inflation comes. Well, assuming that the totality of the data supports such an outcome. No question. That is the case. That as I mentioned, we think that the time is approaching. And if we do get the data that we hope we get, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting. Yes, he. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall Genser with Marketplace. Former New York president, Bill Dudley, wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg earlier this month, which you probably saw in which he said, quote, it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk. Is he wrong? So this is the judgment that we have to make. And we're well aware of the judgment. We're, as I've said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against the risk of going too late. If we go too soon, we can, we had a lot of advice to go ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year. We didn't. We said we needed to see more than we saw some higher inflation. We've seen one quarter of good inflation. And we've seen the labor market move quite a bit. And as I mentioned, I don't think it needs to cool off anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market. Not all inflation is, of course. So I think it's a difficult judgment to make. And what you see is the judgment of the committee is that that time is drawing near. That time could be in September. If the data support that. And have the chances of a hard landing increased? So I don't know whether they've increased. I think they're low. I think this is, you don't see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply weakening. That's just not in the data right now. What's in the data right now is an economy that's growing at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off. But nonetheless, inflation, sorry, unemployment is low. The data overall show a strong labor market. And so that's really what you see. It's neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy. It's kind of what you would want to see. But of course, the job is never done. We're watching to see which way the economy heads. And I think if we are to respond to weakness, we're certainly well equipped to do that. But that's not what we're seeing. What we're seeing is strong economic activity and a good labor market and inflation coming down. Great. Thank you so much. In the minutes of the June meeting that came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications and some Fed officials said maybe the Fed wasn't as clear enough about its reaction function. And when I talk to the commentators who bless you with their comments, they say that they really don't have a sense of what is going to judge maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going forward. They don't have a good sense of that. Is there anything you can say? How will we judge that? Yeah. I think the reality is that forecasters, and this isn't just the Fed by any means, forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the strength of the economy last year. So I think we have to be pretty humble about giving forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing. We need to be pretty careful about that. And when you're saying you're going to be data driven, of course, it's always what the data have. They affect the outlook and the balance of risks, but it's nobody has great vision deep into the future. In terms of a reaction function.",0.0004888913031668,0.0011412836723972309
2024-07-31 18:30:00,2024-07-31 19:15:00,2024-07-31 19:17:36," That's a long time discussion that people have had forever. I think people have understood for a long time actually that we were very focused on bringing down inflation. Nobody was really confused about that. The data have, again, you've seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter. Markets move around on that, on the data really, not so much. It's not really what we're going to do. It's more just that the data keep coming in and markets are very responsive to that data right now. Good evening, Jack, from the last question. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm going to change gears on you just a little bit from all of the way talking what not. With Fed now being in the books for a little over a year, there hasn't been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you could give us an update on where things are with that. Is that considered that issue now? Is it still something that's being discussed within the committee and what's happening with that? It's not something that comes up at all in the FOMC. More broadly, digital finances is an area that's having, that has really significant implications for payments generally. Instant payments. It's something that's going to really change the way it's going to make more efficient and hopefully safer. And all of those things, the way payments are made around the world. And so we have people who are researching that and trying to keep up to speed because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as a, you know, as a convener and as an operator too. In terms of a CBDC, there's really nothing new going on. There's not much going on at all. We're not, we don't have the authority to issue a, you know, a retail CBDC that's available to the public. We're not seeking that authority. So what we're doing is keeping up with, keeping up with developments there. Pretty much every major central bank in the world is, at least doing, doing that. Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC. We're really not, we're really just evaluating, you know, the story and what's happening out there. So, you know, I think it's a, it's work that we need to be doing that, which could be very beneficial down the road. But we don't have, on a CBDC, we don't have any plan to, we would need to go to Congress and we have no plan to do that. We're not, no one here has decided that we think it's a good idea yet.

2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. Inflation is eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August. We're committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year. In available data, point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient and investment in equipment and tangibles has picked up from its endemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand in the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid with a median projection of 2 percent over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool. Payroll job gains averaged 116,000 per month over the past three months. A notable step down from the pace seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent. The nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year. Four tenths higher than projected in June. Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August. And that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter the median projection is 2 percent. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal and labor market conditions were extremely tight. Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation and appropriately so. We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends. Inflation is now much closer to our objective and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished.",0.0001236902090365,0.0006185931424532039
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:35:00,2024-09-18 18:40:00," and the downside risks to employment have increased. We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance. And we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. In late of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks at today's meeting, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point to 4.3 quarters percent to 5 percent. This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could undo a weak and economic activity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, evolving outlook and the balance of risks. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. With the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025. These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks. These projections, however, are not a committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Steve. Steve, please miss again, B.C. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, taking our questions. In July, you said you weren't necessarily thinking about a 50, didn't want to be specific, but you said you weren't thinking about a 50. The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected. The retail was strong, 3.25 GDP running 3 percent. What change has made the committee go 50 and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market? And I guess should we expect more 50s in the months ahead and based on what should we make that call? Thank you. So, okay, a lot of questions in here. Let me jump in. So since the last meeting, okay. The last meeting, we have had a lot of data come in. We've had the two employment reports July and August. We've also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe, that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we're getting may be artificially high and will be revised down. You know that. We've also seen anecdotal data like the beige book. So we took all of those and we went into blackout and we thought about what to do and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve and that's how we made our decision. So that's one question. What was the second and third? We make that decision. Sorry, thank you, sir. How do we figure out in the months ahead is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call? Thank you. Sure. A couple of things. A good place to start is the SEP. But let me start with what I said, which was that we're going to be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks. If you look at the SEP, you'll see that it's a process of...",-0.0025664091438248,0.002829955074463233
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:40:00,2024-09-18 18:45:00," We're collaborating our policy stance away from where we had it a year ago when inflation was high and unemployment low to a place that's more appropriate, given where we are now and where we expect to be. And that process will take place over time. There's nothing in the SEP that suggests the committee is in a rush to get this done. This process evolves over time. Of course, that's a projection, that's a baseline projection. We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do will depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that's appropriate. We can go slower if that's appropriate. We can pause if that's appropriate. But that's what we are contemplating. Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of what the committee is thinking today, but the individual members, rather than the committee, are thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts are realized. Yes. Hi, Chris Ruegabor, Associate of Press. Thank you. The projections show that the Fed officials expect the Fed funds rate to still be above their estimate of long-worn neutral by the end of next year. So does that suggest you see rates as restrictive for that entire period? Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you'd like to avoid? Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little bit higher? Thank you. I think the way I would really characterize it as this, I think people write down their estimate individuals do. I think every single person on the committee, if you ask them what's your level of certainty around that, they would say there's a wide range where that could fall. So I think we don't know. There are model-based approaches and empirically-based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But realistically, we know it by its works. So that leads us in a place where we expect, in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction and we'll be looking at the way the economy reacts to that. And that will be guiding us and our thinking about the question that we're asking at every meeting, which is our policy stance, the appropriate one. We know, if you go back, we know that the policy stance that we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3.5 percent and inflation was 4.2 percent. Today unemployment is up to 4.2 percent. Inflation is down to a few tents above two. So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment, moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even. And this is the beginning of that process. I mentioned the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral. And we'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time. What you have is our individual accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case. Howard? Howard Steinway with Reuters. How close was this in terms of the decision? We do have the first dissent by a governor since 2005, I think, was the weight clearly in favor of a 50 or was this a very close decision? I think we had a good discussion. If you go back, I talked about this in Jacksonville, but I didn't address the question of the size of the cut left it open. And I think we left it open going into blackout. And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity and an excellent discussion today. And I also brought support for the decision that the committee voted on. So I would add though, look at the SEP, all 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year, all 19. That's a big change from June, right? Seven of them wrote down three or more, and sorry, 17 of the 19 wrote down three or more cuts and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts. So there is a dissent and there's a range of views, but there's actually a lot of common ground as well. Follow up to that. Now that this is in the books, do you give us some guidance that's sort of balled just even on the pacing here? Would you expect this to be running every other meeting once we get into next year? We're going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned, there's no sense that the committee feels it's in a rush to do this. We made a good strong start to this, and that's really, frankly, a sign of our confidence. Confidence and inflation is coming down toward 2% on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can make a good strong start. But I'm very pleased that we did. To me, the logic of this, both from an economic standpoint and also from a risk management standpoint, was clear.",-0.0003536067892504,0.0017169964952028773
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:45:00,2024-09-18 18:50:00," But I think we're going to go carefully meeting by meeting and make our decisions as we go. Gina. Hi, Chair Powell. Gina Smiley with the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4% and staying there. Obviously, historically, when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn't typically just stop. It could continue using increasing. And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the labor market stabilizing, sort of what's the mechanism there and what do you see as the risks? So again, the labor market is actually in a solid condition. And our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there. You can say that about the whole economy. The US economy is in good shape. It's growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong pace. We want to keep it there. That's what we're doing. Sorry, Nick. Nick Jimeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, does today's action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data? Or is this larger than typical rate cut a function of the elevated, nominal level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue? Okay. Multiple questions there. So I would say we don't think we're behind. We do not think we're right. We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. So it's a strong move. So your other question was? Well, is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting or is this about the level of the funds rate, the high nominal level of the funds rate relative to what might be expected if you're trying to maintain equilibrium? I think it's about, we come into this with a policy position that was put in place as you know, I mentioned in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low on employment. We've been very patient about reducing the policy rate. We've waited, other central banks around the world have cut many of them several times. We've waited and I think that that patient says really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably into 2%. So I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, oh, this is the new pace. You have to think about it in terms of the base case. Of course, what happens will happen. So in the base case, what you see is look at the SCP. You see cuts moving along. The sense of this is we're recalibrating policy down over time to a more neutral level. And we're moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given developments in the economy in the base case. The economy can develop in a way that would cause us to go faster or slower. That's what the base case is. And if I could follow up on the balance. In 2019, when you did the mid cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff. With a larger cut today, is there any, should there be any single inferred about how the committee would approach end state on the balance sheet policy? So in the current situation, reserves have really been stable. They haven't come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP. So I think what that tells you is we're not thinking about stopping runoff because of this at all. We know that these two things can happen side by side in a sense they're both a form of normalization. And so for a time, you can have the balance sheet shrink, but also be cutting rates. Koby. Thank you. Koby Smith with the Financial Times. Just following up on Gina's question on rising unemployment, is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market amid improved supply? Or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too? And I guess in Darifalc, Gina, why should we not expect a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive? So I think what we're seeing is clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure as I talked about in Jackson Hole. But there's still at a level. The level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment. So you're close to mandate, maybe at mandate on that. So what's driving it?",0.0009259752008939,0.0019525356337753567
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:50:00,2024-09-18 18:55:00," Clearly payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months and this bears watching. It meant by many other measures the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels which was a very good strong labor market but this is more sort of 2018-17. So the labor market bears close watching and we'll be giving it that. But ultimately we think we believe with an appropriate recalibration of our policy that we can continue to see the economy growing and that will support the labor market. In the meantime if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got second quarter GDP all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace. So that should also support the labor market over time. But again we're bears watching and we're watching. And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to happen we didn't think the committee would be too late in terms of avoiding a recession. So our plan of course has been to begin to recalibrate and we're not seeing rising claims, we're not seeing the layoffs, we're not seeing that and we're not hearing that from companies that that's something that's getting ready to happen. So we're not waiting for that because there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it's strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs. There's some lore on that. So that's the situation we're in. We have in fact begun the cutting cycle now and we'll be watching and that'll be one of the factors that we consider. Of course we're going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions meeting by meeting. I vote key. I vote key. I vote key with Bloomberg, TV and radio. To follow up on that, what would constitute for you and the committee a deterioration in the labor market? You're pricing in basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a higher unemployment rate. Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style rather than as you did with inflation waiting until the data gave you a signal? We're going to be watching all of the data. So if, as I mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by cutting faster. We're also going to be looking at other other mandate though. We are more great. We have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 2%, but at the same time our plan is that we will be at 2%. Over time, over time. So, in policy, we think it's still restrictive, so that should still be happening. I'm just curious as to how sensitive you'll be to the labor market since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment, and it is going to take a significant amount of monetary easing to just maintain it. So, you know, what I would say is we don't think we need to see further losing in labor market conditions to get inflation at a 2%. But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as, take a step back. What have we been trying to achieve? We're trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with this inflation. That's what we're trying to do. And I think you can take today's action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal. Rachel? Hi, Terpau, Rachel Siegel from Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You're describing this view that you don't think you're behind when it comes to the job market. Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be most helpful in the discussions at this meeting? You've mentioned a couple, but would you be able to walk us through what that dashboard told you as far as what you know about the job market now? Sure. So we'll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably. You're at 4.2%. I know that's higher than we were used to seeing numbers in the mid and even below mid-3s last year. But if you look back over the sweep of the years, that's a low, that's a very healthy unemployment rate. And anything in the low-4s is a really good labor market. That's one thing. Participation is at high levels. We've had, we're adjusted for demographics for aging. Participation is at pretty high levels. That's a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what would be, their wage increases rather are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2% inflation. But they're very much coming down to what that sustainable level is. So we feel good about that. Vacancies over per...",7.079520716441057e-05,0.0007968550786229136
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:55:00,2024-09-18 19:00:00," unemployed is back to what is still a very strong level. It's not as high as it was that number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person has measured. It's now below around one, but that's still a very good number, I would say. Quits have come back down to normal levels. I mean, that could go on and on. There are many, many employment indicators. What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn't the level. The question is that there has been change over particularly over the last few months. And so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risk to inflation have really come down, the downside risk to employment have increased. And because we have been patient and held our fire on cutting while inflation has come down, I think we're now in a very good position to manage the risks to both of our goals. And what do you expect to learn between now and November that will help inform the scale of the next meeting? You know, more data the usual. Don't look for anything else. We'll see another labor report. We'll see another jobs report. I think we get a, we actually get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think. No, no, on the Friday before the meeting. So, and inflation data, we'll get all this data. We'll be watching. So it's always a question of look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks. And then go through our process and think what's the right thing to do? Is policy where we want it to be to foster the achievement of our goals over time? So that's what it is and that's what we'll be doing. Yeah. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. We've only been running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payrolls last three months. Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming or would you be content if we were to kind of stick at that level? And, relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the last couple of years has been labor market steam coming out through job openings falling rather than job losses. Do you think that trend has further to run or do you see risk that further labor market cooling will have to come through job losses? So on the job creation, it depends on, it depends on the inflows, right? So if you're having millions of people come into the labor force then and you're creating 100,000 jobs, you're going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what's the trend that underline the volatility of people coming into the country. We understand there's been quite an influx across the borders. And that has actually been one of the things that's that's allowed unemployment rate to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what's happening on the supply side. And on the beverage curve question, yes. So we all felt on the committee, not all, but I think everyone on the committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could follow a long way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into a higher unemployment job loss. And yes, I mean, I think we are, it's hard to know that you can't know these things with great precision. But certainly, it appears that we're very close to that point, if not at it, so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it's been a great ride down. I mean, we've seen a lot of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in a lower employment. Thanks, Chip. Edward Lawrence, Fox Business. So we've heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal fund rate to 3.5, maybe under 4%. And there's basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near zero federal fund rate. And it's something we're heading in that direction. Again, what's the likelihood that cheap money is now the norm? So this is a question. And you mean after we get through all of this, it's just great question that we can only speculate about. Intuitively, most many, many people, anyway, would say, we're probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates, long term bonds trading at negative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate might even be negative. So there was people who were issuing, that issuing get at negative rates. It seems that's so far away now. My own sense is that we're not going back to that. But honestly, we're going to find out. But it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was back then. How high is it? I just don't think.",0.0004597701149425,0.0016636579236134201
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 19:00:00,2024-09-18 19:05:00," We know. Again, we only know it by its works. One more. How do you respond to the criticism that will likely come that a deeper rate cut now before the election has some political motivations? Yeah, so you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the Fed and you know, it's always the same. We're always going into this meeting in particular and asking what's the right thing to do for the people we serve. We do that and we make a decision as a group and then we announce it. And that's always what it is. It's never about anything else. Nothing else is discussed. And I would also point out that the things that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag. So nonetheless, this is what we do. Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people. And if we get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly. So this really concentrates the mind and you know, it's something we all take very, very seriously. We don't put up any other filters. I think if you start doing that, I don't know where you stop. And so we just don't do that. Jolie. Thank you, Chair Powell. I'm Jolie Kent with CBS News. My first question is very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the American people, with this unusually large rate cut? I would just say that the U.S. economy is in a good place and our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down closer to our 2% objective over time. And the labor market is still in solid shape. So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the U.S. economy. And we'll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control. We're going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time. Just a follow-up to that. Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2%, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices? No. We're not. So inflation, what we say is we want inflation, the goal is to have inflation move down to 2% on a sustainable basis. We're not really at 2%, and I think we're going to want to see it be around 2%, and close to 2% for some time. But we're certainly not doing, we're not saying mission accomplished or anything like that. But I have to say, though, we're encouraged by the progress that we have made. I just would love to know kind of how the committee is thinking about the persistence we've seen in housing inflation. Do you think you can return to 2% with housing inflation where it is? Yeah. So housing inflation is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit, if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which is to be moving up at relatively low levels. But they're not rolling over, the leases that are rolling over are not coming down as much, and OER is coming in high. So it's been slower than we expected. I think we now understand that it's going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this. But the direction of travel is clear, and as long as market rents remain relatively low inflation over time that will show up, just the time it's taking now several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals. I think we understand that now. I don't think the outcome is endowed as long as market rents remain under control. The outcome is not endowed. So I would say the rest of the port full or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well. They all have some volatility. We will get down to 2% inflation, I believe, and I believe that ultimately we'll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece too. Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that with starting to cut rates, you could re-ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more. What's the likelihood of that and how would you react to that? The housing market is a game that out. The housing market is in part frozen because of the...",-0.0008859367517424,0.0011718958078090309
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 19:05:00,2024-09-18 19:10:00," lock in with low rates, people don't want to sell their home. So because they have a very low mortgage, it'd be quite expensive to refinance. As rates come down, people will start to move more and that's probably beginning to happen already. But remember when that happens, you've got to sell it, but you've also got a new buyer in many cases. So it's not obvious how much additional demand that would make me. The real issue with housing is that we have had and are on track to continue to have not enough housing. And so it's going to be challenging. It's hard to find to zone lots that are in places where people want to live. It's all of the aspects of housing are warmer, difficult. And where are we going to get the supply? And this is not something that the Fed can really fix. But I think as we normalize rates, you'll see the housing market normalize. And I mean, ultimately, by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and getting the housing cycle normalized, that's the best thing we can do for householders. And then the supply question will have to be dealt with by the market and also by government. Thanks, Ryan. Hi, I'm Tori Witte with Politico. Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, monetary policy operates with long and variable legs. And I'm wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too much comes from the fact that you're starting to act now. And that's going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong. And then also if I could following up on Nick's question, do you see today's 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that you didn't cut in July? And that sort of gets you to the same place. So you're right about legs, but I would just point to the overall economy. You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace. If you look at forecasters or talk to companies, they'll say that they think 2025 should be a good year too. So there's no sense that the US economy is basically fine. If you talk to market participants, I mean, business people who are actually out there doing business. So I think our move is timely. I do. And as I said, you can see our 50 basis point move as a commitment to make sure that we don't fall behind. So you're really asking about your second question. You're asking about July. And I guess if you ask if we'd gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut, we might well of, we didn't make that decision, but we might well of. I think that doesn't really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is let's look at this meeting. We're looking back to the July Implement Report, the August Implement Report, the two CPI reports, one of which came, of course, during blackout. And all the other things that I mentioned, we're looking at all of those things, and we're asking ourselves, what's the right, what's the policy stance we need to move to? We knew it's clear that we clearly, literally, everyone in the committee agreed that it's time to move. It's just how fast you go, and what do you think about the past forward? So this decision we made today had broad support on the committee, and I've discussed the path ahead. Let's bet. Thank you, Chair Powell. Elizabeth Schullsley with ABC News. Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement. How much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year? Very hard for me to say. From our standpoint, I can't really speak to mortgage rates. I will say that will depend on how the economy evolves. Our intention, though, is we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive. We think that it's time to begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that's more neutral rather than restrictive. We expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today. And as if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs. We can't look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing. It's going to be doing. What's your message to households who are frustrated that home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high? What do you say to those households? Well, I can say to the public is that we had the highest and we had a burst of inflation. Many other countries around the world had a similar.",-0.0014213125821697,0.0022257438435925284
2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 19:10:00,2024-09-18 19:15:00," or burst of inflation. And when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It's not something that people experience as pleasant. But at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored. And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions they're not thinking about inflation anymore. That's where everyone wants to be, is back to what's inflation. Just keep it low, keep it stable. We're restoring that. So what we're going through now really will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don't have to deal with inflation. So that's what's been going on. And I think we've made real progress. I completely, we don't tell people how to think about the economy, of course. And of course, people are experiencing high prices as opposed to high inflation. And we understand that's painful. Hi, Chair Powell. Greg Rob for MarkerWatch.com. I was wondering if you could go through. You said just at the beginning that coming into the blackout, there was like an open thought of 25 or 50. The Fed could move either 25 or 50. I would sort of argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York Fed President John Williams, they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day. I mean, I sort of want to ask a seven part question about this. But I mean, could you talk, would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in low odds of a 50 point move like they were last Wednesday? After the CPI number came out, there's a really small probability of a 50 point cut. Does that play in your consideration at all? Just talk a little bit about it. Thank you. We're always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for the economy at that time. That's what we'll do. And that's what we did today. Simon. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon, your speech with the economist. You've mentioned how closely you're watching the labor market. But you also noted that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions. Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate? And given the SCP projection of 4.4 basic, being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut? So we will continue to look at that broader ray of labor market data, including the payroll numbers. We're not discarding those. I mean, we'll certainly look at those. But we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you refer to. There is an upright line. It will be the unemployment rate is very important, of course. But there is a single statistic or a single bright line over which that might move that would dictate one thing or another. We'll look at each meeting. We'll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market. And we'll make decisions about is our policy stance where it needs to foster over the medium term or mandate goals. So I can't say we have a bright line in mind. Thanks, Chair Powell. Madigan from CNN. I know that you discussed earlier how Fed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in. But in general, can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting US president should have a say in Fed decisions on interest rates? Because that's something that former President Trump, who obviously pointed to you, has previously suggested. And I know the Fed is designed to be independent. But why? Can you tell the public why you view that so important? Sure. So countries that are democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office, as opposed to people who are not in office. So that's the idea. It is that I think the data are clear that countries that have independent central banks, they get lower inflation.

It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that's how the other central banks are set up, too. It's a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public. And I hope it, and I hope, and strongly believe that it will continue. Hi. Hi, I'll gamble for American banker. Thanks for taking the questions. Mr. Chair Powell, a couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask you about. First last week, Vice Chair for supervision, Michael Barr outlined his views for the changes to the Basel 3N game. I'm wondering if you are in alignment with him on those changes should be, if those have support on the board in a broad way that you're looking for. And if you think the other agencies are also fully on board with that approach. And then yesterday, other banking regulators, you know what, hold the second question. Okay, sure. Let me give you the second question. So, the answer to your question is that, yes, those changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with my involvement, with the idea that we were going to repropose, repropose the changes that we, that Vice Chair Barr talked about, and then take comment on them. So, yes, that is, you know, that's happening with my support. That's not a final proposal, though. You understand? We're putting them out for comment. We're going to take comment and make appropriate changes. We don't have a calendar date for that. And as for the other agencies, you know, the idea is that we're all moving together. We're not moving separately. So, that I don't know exactly where that is, but the idea is that we will move as a group to put this again out, out for comment. And then, you know, it'll come, the comments will come back 60 days later and we'll dive into them and we'll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year. Right. And then, yesterday, there were merger reform finalizations from the other bank regulators. Well, what does it have to do to align itself on merger? You know, I would, I would bounce that question to Vice Chair Barr. It's a good question, but I don't have that today. Jennifer, for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Jean-Burger with Yahoo Finance. You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration strength in the labor market that can be maintained in the context of moderate growth. Even though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly balanced. Given what you've said, though, today I'm curious, are you more worried about the job market and growth than inflation? Are they not roughly balanced? No, I think, I think, and we think they are now roughly balanced. So, so if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation. We had historically tight labor market, historically tight. There was a severe labor shortage. So very, very hot labor market and we had inflation way above target. So, you know, that said to us, concentrated inflation, concentrated inflation and we did for a while and we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation. Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and the little bit cooling off the labor market. You now have a cooler labor market in part because of our activity. So what that tells you is it's time to change our stance. So we did that. The sense of the change in the stance is that we're recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral. And today was, I think we made a good strong start on that. I think it was the right decision and I think it should send a signal that we, you know, that we're committed to coming up with a good outcome here. Is the economy more horrible to a shock now that could dip it into recession? I don't think so. I don't, there's, as I look, well, let me look at it this way. I don't see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a recession, sorry, of a downturn is elevated. Okay, I don't see that. You see growth at a solid rate. You see inflation coming down and you see a labor market that's still at very solid levels. So I don't really see that. No. Thank you. Thank you.",-0.0007970667941974,0.0011347316536940593
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.1% as of September. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2% goal. Today the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. We continue to be confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2%. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I'll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Foreign indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In the labor market, conditions remain solid. Pay-roll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months. This figure would have been somewhat higher where not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment in October. Using the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families, businesses, and communities who have been harmed by these devastating storms. The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago, but its edge down over the past three months and remains low at 4.1% in October. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years. Total PCE prices rose 2.1% over the 12 months ending in September, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Our PCE prices rose 2.7%. Overall, inflation has moved much closer to our 2% longer run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we're attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate. At today's meeting, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.5% to 4.3% quarters percent. This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market, and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time. We know that reducing policy strength to restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals.",-0.0005043288223923,0.000622392679316385
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:35:00,2024-11-07 18:40:00," If the economy remains strong and inflation is not sustainably moving toward 2%, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly, where inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can move more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy. Maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our discussion. Thank you. Given the expectation that the election outcome will produce policies that would meaningfully impact the U.S. economy next year, how is the committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the next one in December? Can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive the Fed is prepared to be to change as an economic policy with the next administration? Sure. So, let me say that in the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions. As you know, many, many things affect the economy and anyone who writes down forecasts in their job will tell you that the economy is quite difficult to forecast looking out past the very near term. Here we don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don't know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables, maximum employment, and price stability. We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume. Now just in principle, it's possible that any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time that would matter. For our pursuit of our dual mandate goals. So, along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel. Nate. Chair Powell, Nick Timmeros from the Wall Street Journal. Roughly one year ago, when the tenure treasury was flirting with 5% and 30-year mortgage rates were near 8%, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh on economic activity. Given that you've said you believe policy is restrictive and the Fed is now dialing back that restriction, are the growth risks presented by higher U.S. Treasury yields today any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above your target? So we just say this. We've watched the run up in bond rates and it's nowhere near where it was a course a year ago, I guess, the long bond rates are well below that level. So we're watching that. Things have been moving around and we'll see where they settle. I think it's too early to really say where they settle. Ultimately, I'm sure we've all read these decomposition of what, and I certainly have, it's not really our job to provide our specific decomposition. I will say, though, that it appears that the moves are not principally about higher inflation expectations. They're really about a sense of more likely that of stronger growth. It perhaps less than the way of downside risks. That's what they're about. We do take financial conditions into account if they're persistent and if they're material, then we'll certainly take them into account in our policy. But I would say we're not at that stage right now. It's just something that we're watching. And again, these things don't really have mainly to do with Fed policy, but to do with other factors in the economy. If I could follow up, is the September SEP, are those rate projections still valid? Do they still seem relevant given where we are now? You know, you get halfway through the cycle between the last set and the next set. I wouldn't want to comment one way or the other. Let's talk about the data we've gotten since the last meeting. So in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected. The NIPA revision was stronger. Certainly, the September and Plimmer report was stronger. Yachtover report, not stronger. Retail sales stronger. So overall, though, I think you take away a sense of.",2.523065019383255e-05,0.0002683242770386651
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:40:00,2024-11-07 18:45:00," of some of the downside risks to economic activity having been diminished with the NIPA revisions in particular. And so overall feeling good about economic activity. So I think we would factor that in. At the same time, we got one inflation report which was, it wasn't terrible, but it was a little higher than expected. So I think really the question is December and you know, by December we'll have more data. I guess one more employment report, two more inflation reports and lots of other data and you know, we'll make a decision as we get to December. Gina Smiley from the New York Times, thanks for taking our question to Chair Powell. When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically as you try to make that decision? And then as of the Fed's economic projections in September, you had written down for quarter point interest rate cuts in 2025. Do you still think that those are likely as that sort of the baseline outlook at this point or has that shifted and if it shifted at all, can you give a little bit of detail as to why? We don't fill out an SEP and I can't characterize one that wasn't filled out today. So I can't really speak for exactly where the committee is. I would just say for December we're going to be again, and every meeting we're going to be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook. As you know, we're in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at 5.33%. After today's move, we're down 75 basis points and we're asking ourselves is that where we need to be? You know that we're trying to steer between the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much. We're trying to be on a middle path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress on inflation. We think that's where we are, but that's the question we're going to be asking in September and in other meetings. And again, I can't really update you on the committee's thinking because we don't fill out an SEP at this meeting. Yeah, totally appreciate that. I guess when it comes to your own thinking, do you think that that a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025 is a reasonable outlook? Again, we're going to wait and see how things come in in December. I mean, it's just, I would put it this way. We're on a path to a more neutral stance and that's very much what we're on. That has not changed at all since September. And we're just going to have to see where the data lead is. We have a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December. Obviously, I'm not ruling it out or in, but I would say that again, we didn't update the SEP, so I'm not going to characterize where the committee would be. How are you? Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wanted if you could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement here in the first paragraph when you say inflation has made progress in dropping the word further progress. And in the second paragraph, dropping the sentence at the committee again, greater confidence that inflation was progressing towards its 2% goal. Is there any policy substance behind either of those changes in language? Is it meant to open the door to a December pause? Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core inflation the last three months? Not really, no. So let me tell you what we were thinking. So the test of gaining further confidence was our test for the first rate cut. And so we net that test in September, and therefore we take that test out. If you leave it in, then it's new forward guidance. It's brand new forward guidance. What do you mean by it? Are you requiring yet further? We have to say yes or no at every meeting, whether we've made further progress. The point is we have gained confidence that we're on a sustained path than a 2%. So that I would tell you is what that's really all about. It's not meant to send a signal. Neither of those is meant to send a further signal. Saying further progress, it becomes a test. We don't want to be, we don't think it's a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance. There's a fair amount of uncertainty in that. What I've said, the path that we're on, we do know where the destination is, but we don't know the right pace, and we don't know exactly where the destination is. So the point is to find that, to find the right pace and the right destination as we go. And I think there's a fair amount of uncertainty.",-0.0005380592874078,0.0005721737167183351
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:45:00,2024-11-07 18:50:00," Certainly about that, you don't want to tie yourself up with guidance. You want to be able to make sensible decisions as you go. Steve. Steve Lee Smith, CNBC, Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth. You didn't talk about it in terms of expectations of higher deficits. Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in interest rates? And is that our rising deficits are concerned to you? So we know common in fiscal policy. And again, I don't have a lot more to say on what's driving bond yields. In terms of policy changes, though, let me give you a sense of how this works in the ordinary case. Let's say Congress is considering a rewrite of the tax laws, doesn't matter what's in the content. So we would follow that. At a certain point, we'd think we see the outlines. So we'd start to model it. And then we'd wait and we'd wait. And at a certain point, the staff would brief the FOMC and say, you know, these are the likely effects. There's lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy changes on various parts of the economy. So we'd try to get smart on that. And then the law actually passes. And you know, you'd start to put it, you'd probably run an alternative simulation before that happens, just to keep people trying to understand it. And then it actually passes. It goes into the model along with a million other things. So, you know, we have a very large economy. Many things are affecting at a given time. And, you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but it would go in. But it would, you know, it's a process that takes some time. Clearly, the legislative process takes a lot of time. And of course, the real question is not the effect of that law. It's all of the policy changes that are happening. What's the net effect? And, you know, the overall effect on the economy at a given time. So I think that's a process that takes a lot of time and that we go through all the time with every administration constantly. And I just, this will be no different. But, you know, right now we're, there's nothing to, there's nothing to model right now. We're, it's such an early stage. We don't know what the policies are. And once we know what they are, we won't have a sense of, you know, when they'll be implemented or all those sorts of things. So I think I would just say we're not doing that now. And all that will take time and it will be very much regular order when we do do that. If I could just follow up on Nick's question. Are the current rates something you feel like you need to lean against in that they go against the direction of policy by being adding restrictions to the economy? Or do you just take them as a given, perhaps a signal that you should do less? I look, I just think the first question is how long will they be sustained? If you remember the 5% 10 year people were drawing were massively important conclusions only to find, you know, three weeks later the 10 year was 50 basis points lower. So, you know, it's, it's material changes in financial conditions that last that are persistent that really matter. And we don't know that about these. What we've seen so far, you know, we're watching it, we're reading, you know, we're doing the decomposition and reading others. But right now it's not a major factor in how we're thinking about things. Chris. Chris. Thank you, Chris Regaber, it's associated press. You mentioned the positive economic data that we've seen since the September meeting, including the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth. We saw stock market jump yesterday. That's renewed. Some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this, with this backdrop? So, you're right. As I mentioned, as you mentioned, the latest economic data have been strong and that's, of course, a great thing and highly welcome. But of course, our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability. And we think that even with today's cut policy is still restrictive. We understand it's not possible to say precisely how restrictive, but we feel that it is still restrictive. And if you look at our goal variables, the labor market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially in balance. It is continuing to cool, albeit at a modest rate. And we don't need further cooling, we don't think, to achieve our inflation mandate. So that's the labor market. Inflation has moved down a great deal from its higher, its highs of two years ago. And we judged, as I mentioned, that it's on a sustainable path back to 2%. So the job's not done on inflation. But if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress. And today's decision is really another step in that process. Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables for their progress toward our inflation goal.",0.0001514259274838,0.0002019012366450821
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:50:00,2024-11-07 18:55:00," Great. And just to follow up, what might cause you to pause rate cuts in December? What kind of economic data would lead you to that path? Thank you. So we haven't made any decision like that at all. So we're in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down our stance down over time to more neutral level. And as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves. So for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we'd be prepared to move more quickly. Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we're dialing back restriction. Again, haven't made any decisions about that, but that's certainly possibility. If you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset runoff with QT. So we reach a point where we slow the pace, much like an airplane reaching the airport slows down. And so we're thinking about it that way, but it's something that we're just beginning to think about. Thanks, Sherpa. So with the noise and the jobs reports that we've seen, and you look at the Fed's favorite inflation, PC inflation, overall, it's 2.1%, very close to the Fed's target, but core inflation is 2.7%. And it's been that way since July. So why doesn't this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting? Well, so I think if you look at the three and six month, you're quoting the 12 month. So we look at all of them, right? But if you look at the three and six month core PCE, you'll see they're around 2.3%. So we look at all of them, and we look at 12 as well, but what it's telling us is that we really have made significant progress. And we expect there to be bumps, for example, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings were very, very low, probably unsustainably low. So that's why you see, that's why forecast generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year. On the other hand, the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality so that we saw last year. So when that falls out of the 12 month calculation in February, we should see a thing down. So it'll literally be a bump up and then down. We understand that. Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy and you say, what is the inflation story now? Where's it coming from? So I point to a couple of things. One is the non-housing services and goods, which together make up 80% of the core PCE index, are back to the levels they were at the last time we had sustained 2% inflation, which happens to be in the early 2000s for a period of 5, 6, 7 years. So they're back to that level. What's not is housing services. So let's talk about housing services. Housing services is higher. What's going on there is market rents, newly signed leases are experiencing very low inflation. And what's happening is older leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market leases are, market rent leases are. So that's just a catch up problem. It's not really reflecting current inflationary pressures. It's reflecting past inflationary pressures. So that's one thing. The other thing is I'd say, look at the labor market, not a source of inflationary pressures. Where's it coming from? It's not a very tight economy. What is the story about inflation? You see that catch up inflation also in insurance and several other areas. So you're seeing, we're not the clearing victory obviously, but we feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2%. That story isn't tacked and it won't be one or two really good data months or bad data months aren't going to really change the pattern at this point now that we're this far into the process. So you're quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you see or do you foresee that you have some time to get there? Nothing in the economic data suggests that the committee has any need to be in a hurry to get there. We are seeing strong economic activity. We are seeing ongoing strength in the labor market. We're watching that carefully, but we do see maintaining strength there. And so we think that the right way to find neutral, if you will, is carefully, patiently. Again, that does not meant to have a specific meaning other than to the extent that the economy remains strong. We have the ability to take advantage of that as we try to navigate that middle path between the two risks.",0.0004037073794344,0.0004794065451608841
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:55:00,2024-11-07 19:00:00," Hi, Chair Powell, Craig Taurus from Bloomberg. Two questions today. Did you learn anything about what Americans think about the economy from the election results? First question. Second question. I want to talk about some labor market indicators. And I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum employment side of the mandate, Chair Powell. So the unemployment rate has been at 4% or higher for six months. One of the broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago. Compensation gains are sliding back. The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading down to that bad neighborhood of the 20 teens. So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole saying, any further cooling is unwelcome. It is cooling generally a little bit further. So what point do we reach what you would describe as a shortfall from maximum employment? Thank you. Sure. So on your first question, I'm not going to talk about anything that relates directly to the election. On the second one, this is the great question. And so when we think about all the time. So I'll just say a couple of things. You know, nothing really surprising here. What we know is that the unemployment rate is low. We also know that it's come down significantly, sorry, moved up significantly from a year or so ago. So we've seen a big change upward and unemployment. Sometimes that has meant bad things so far. It doesn't appear to be. It appears that the, I wouldn't say that the labor market has fully stabilized because I do think it's continuing to very gradually cool. But it seems to be in a good place and our policy, of course, is designed to keep it in that good place to maintain the strength in the labor market. We'll also enabling further progress on inflation. You know, you mentioned a bunch of indicators and you're right. You know, the openings to unemployment rate is back to a normal level. I would characterize it more broadly as normalizing. You mentioned wages. Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be consistent with 2% inflation. Unless productivity is going to remain at this high level, if we see productivity more sustainably at these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains. So I would say, in fact, you can say it the other way that wage increases are now consistent with 2% inflation given current productivity readings. But of course, the lower on productivity readings is whenever you see high readings, you should assume they're going to revert pretty quickly to the longer term trend. That has always been the case for 50 years. But it may be that we were now five years, if you look at the NIPA revisions that came out a month ago. We're five years into a nice set of productivity readings which are sustained and very healthy. But overall, it's a good labor market. We can talk about 20 different data series. We'll be looking at all of them, of course. But we don't want the labor market to soften much from here. We don't think we need that to happen to get inflation back to 2%. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we know with Politico. Some of the President's election advisors have suggested that you should resign. If he asked you to leave, would you go? No. Can you follow up on, do you think that legally he did not require to leave? No. Mike? Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio Intelligence. You talk a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data. But in terms of forward looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials around the country? What did you hear today from the regional bank presidents about what companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here rather than looking backwards? And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you think the appropriate policy path should be? So it's hard to characterize a really interesting set of discussions we had and of course you'll see them in the minutes in three weeks. But I would say this, I think the comments from our reserve bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talked to are pretty constructive on the economy right now, pretty constructive, feeling that the labor market is...",-3.361175066800298e-05,0.00021848739495797554
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 19:00:00,2024-11-07 19:05:00," is back to normal to the point where it's no longer that much a discussion topic in their world. Whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking about. So they feel like the labor markets in balance, people feel good about where the economy is. Demand is obviously pretty strong. And you're seeing what, 2.8% growth in the third quarter estimated maybe the years, two and a half. This is a strong economy. It's actually remarkable how well the US economy has been performing with strong growth, a strong labor market inflation coming down. We're really performing better than any of our global peers. And I think that is reflected in what you hear from what I hear people hear from CEOs. I don't get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from those. And of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that. And it's pretty constructive overall. Now that's not to say there are areas of caution and things like that, but ultimately overall pretty positive. The follow up, the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on the horizon that you identified as something you're watching, what would they be? I think it's things like clearly geopolitical risks around the world are elevated. And just as clearly they've had relatively little effect on the US economy. Now that can change through the price of oil or otherwise. But people talk about those as something that's on the horizon all the time. But ultimately, if you look at the US economy, its performance has been very good. And that's what we hear from business people. And expectation that that will continue. If anything, people feel next year, I've heard this from several people that next year could even be stronger than this year. Andrew. Hi, it's Andrew Ackerman with the Washington Post. I just wanted to follow up on the discussion earlier on fiscal policy. Your predecessor is Greenspan and Volcker. Spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits and danger financial economic or financial stability. Will you do that too? And right now we're in a period of full employment. We have large budget deficits and debt at historic. You know, historic highs that are end rising. Is that something you'd speak out against? So, you know, I have said many times, no more, no less than what the predecessors you mentioned have said. And what that is is that the US federal government's fiscal path, fiscal policy, is on an unsustainable path. The level of our debt relative to the economy is not unsustainable. The path is unsustainable. And we see that and you know, you've got a very large deficit at your full employment and that's expected to continue. So, it's important that we, you know, that to be dealt with, it is ultimately a threat to the economy. Now, I can say that. I don't have oversight. We don't have oversight over fiscal policy. I've said it on many occasions. Just said it again. Okay, thank you. I guess the other way of the question is to follow up on Victoria's question. Do you believe that the president has the power to fire or to vote you and it has the Fed determine the legality of a president demoting out will any of the other governors with leadership positions? Not permitted under the law. Not what? Not permitted under the law. Thank you. Courtney. Courtney Brown from Axios. In response to Howard's question, you said it wasn't an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the economic uncertainties. Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not it includes some of the proposals that the president-elect has put out on the campaign trail, tariffs, for instance? No, I was not referring to the new administration's policies at all, nor will I today. So, what I'm just saying is, as we look ahead, we know, as I mentioned this in my statement that the risks are two sides. I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very good place. And but as you look forward, you say what are the risks? And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly and inflation comes back and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2%. So we have to avoid that risk. And to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully. The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and to people's working lives.",-0.0002015871414639,0.002019522046448892
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 19:05:00,2024-11-07 19:10:00," That says don't get behind the curve. So these are two things, the two risks that we have to manage. And so we're in the middle there. We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the manage, both of those. Again, the idea is to maintain support the strength we have in the labor market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy, enable further progress toward our 2% inflation goal. And so there's, you know, this is a thing we're meeting by meeting we're going to be making our assessment of what the right path is. You know, it's not as important. The precise timing of these things is not as important as the overall arc of them. And the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of neutral, a more neutral policy. We don't know exactly where that is. We only know it by its works. We're pretty sure it's below where we are now. But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is. And we're going to move carefully as this goes on so that, you know, we can increase the chances that we will get it right. Simon. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon and Minovitch with the Economist. I know you don't want to share your decomposition of bond yields. But if you look at the break evins, it is clear that longer term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at about 2.5%, for example, on the five-year, that's up half a point from when you cut in September. Do you have any concern at all that longer term inflation expectations are de-anchoring or put another way are anchoring at a slightly higher level? Thanks. So we would be concerned if we saw, if we thought we saw longer term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level. That's not what we're seeing. We're still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with, you know, I looked at the five-year, five-year earlier today and it's probably moved, but it's just kind of right where it's been and also it's pretty close to consistent with 2% PCE inflation. So that's one that's been a traditional one that we look at a lot. But overall, expectations seem to be, and have really have throughout this in a place that's consistent with 2% inflation. You're right to say we watched that very carefully and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward, but that's really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was to avoid that. Hi Chair Powell, Kelly O'Grady, CBS News. We just talked about what you've heard from business leaders on the economy, but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets. So what's your message to them on when they might expect relief? So you're right that we say the economy's performing well and it is, but we also know that people are still feeling the effects of high prices, for example. And we went through the world, went through a global inflation shock and inflation went up everywhere and it stays with you because the price level doesn't come back down. So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better. And that's what we're trying to create and I think we're well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down, the economy's still strong here. Wages are moving up at a sustainable level. So I think what needs to happen is happening and for the most part has happened, but it'll be sometime before people regain their confidence and feel that. And we don't tell people how to feel about the economy. We respect completely respect what they're feeling. Those feelings are true, they're accurate. We don't question them. We respect them. And just a quick follow up. President-elect Trump has been critical of your performance. Any concern about his influence on the Fed's independence? I'm not going to get into any of the political things here today. But thank you. Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. What is your plan if we start to see stagflation? So that's a, you know, the whole plan is not to have stagflation so we don't have to deal with it. So that's our, that is actually our plan. You know, it's of course a very difficult thing because you're, you know, you're anything you do with interest rates will, will hurt one side or the other either the inflation mandate or the, or the, or the employment mandate. I would just say that, you know, we, we, we've been able to see inflation come down a whole lot, you know, much closer to our goal without the kind of sharp and sharp.",0.0001007315227444,0.0007739417188236697

So not going wood, we've gotten as far without seeing a real weakening in the labor market. We believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong and that of course is exactly what we're trying to do. Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year? No, I wouldn't rule anything out of him that far away. But that's certainly not our plan. I mean our baseline expectation is that we'll continue to move gradually down towards neutral that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip and that the labor market will remain strong if you look at our, that will not change from the September SEP. That is our baseline forecast and short of some exogenous event that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future. But ultimately, we're not in a war where we can afford to rule things out of full year in advance. It's just too much uncertainty in what we do. Good, a team for the last question. Hi Chair Powell, Jean Young with M&I Market News. I wanted to go back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the cumulative price level rises over the past few years even though now inflation is back on a path to 2%. Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal under the average inflation targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up? No, that's not the way our framework works. We're aiming for inflation at 2%. We do not have, we did not think it would be appropriate to deliberately undershoot. And part of the problem there is that low inflation can be a problem too. But that's not part of our framework and it's not something we're going to be looking at in our framework review. Thank you very much.",-0.0003695736206113,0.0004201482169927028
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2% longer run goal. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2% goal. To that end today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient and investment in equipment and tangible bulls as strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2% over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions remain solid. A role job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 173,000 per month over the past three months. The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but at 4.2% in November, it has remained low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2% at the end of this year and 4.3% over the next few years. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years, but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2% longer run goal. That's based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5% over the 12 months ending in November, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8%. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.4% this year and 2.5% next year, somewhat higher than projected in September. Thereafter the median projection falls to our 2% objective. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate. At today's meeting, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.4.5%. We've been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market while establishing further progress and sorry enabling further progress on inflation. With today's action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.",0.0002148014738685,0.00034521445022423267
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:35:00,2024-12-18 18:40:00," We're not on any preset course. In our summary of economic projections, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to meet the most likely scenario going forward. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9% at the end of next year, and 3.4% at the end of 2026. These median projections are somewhat higher than in September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection. These projections, however, are not a committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. If the economy remains strong, inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2%. We can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly, or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. On technical note, we lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repo facility to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate, its typical configuration. Technical adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to support in maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. I want to talk a little bit about why officials think it's appropriate to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year. And what would you expect at this point the timing might look like? Would a January cut potentially be possible or does it pause next month seem more likely? Well, so let me start by saying why we cut today and then move to 2025. So I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals, maximum employment and price stability. We see the risks as to side it moving too slowly and needlessly undermine economic activity in the labor market or move too quickly and needlessly undermine our progress on inflation. So we're trying to steer between those two risks. On balance we decided to go ahead with the further cut and I'll give you some details on why. Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic and it's clearly still cooling further so far in a gradual and orderly way. We don't think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%. Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant. The job finding rate is low and declining and other measures such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits things like that, broadly show a much cooler labor market than there was that we had in 2019. It's still quite gradually cooling. So we keep an eye on that. Inflation, we see that story is still broadly on track and I'll tell you why we've made a great deal of progress. Twelve month core inflation as I mentioned through November is estimated at 2.8% down from a high of 5.6%. Twelve month inflation has actually been moving sideways as we are lapping the very low readings of late last year. Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like, but it has now come down substantially and is making progress slower than hoped. And we've had recent high readings from non-market services and some bumpiness for good. So I'll just say, so remember that we coupled this decision today with the extent and timing language in the post meeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments. You ask about 2025. I think that the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects.",6.604910751137468e-05,0.0001139384732243927
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:40:00,2024-12-18 18:45:00," Both the higher inflation readings we've had this year and the expectation inflation will be higher. You saw in the SCP that risks and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we see ourselves as still on track to continue to cut. I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today. We're going to react to data that's just a general sense of what the committee thinks is likely to be appropriate. Sorry, just one quick follow up. Why, I guess, would you make those cuts? Like what would be the trigger to cut? So we're to cut further after this point. I would say this way we've reduced our policy right now by 100 basis points. We're significantly closer to neutral. At 4.3% and change we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive. But as for additional cuts we're going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued straight into the labor market. And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid we can be cautious about as we consider further cuts. And all of that is reflected to your question in the December SCP which shows a median forecast of down two cuts next year compared to four in September. Power sign with winners and thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. So this does seem to be the dynamic in 2016 during the last transition to a Trump administration where the committee saw slightly tighter policy in part in expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year. Some of it was a data market exercise and some of it was anticipation of fiscal. What's the split on this one? How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year? I'd say I'd point to five or six things and let me start by saying that we think the economy is in a really good place. And we think policy is in a really good place. Let's remember that the economy is growing 2.5% this year. That inflation has come down by 50% to from 5.6% to 2.6%. Headline inflation is 2.5% on a 12-month basis. We're actually in a really good starting place here. But since, you know, so what's really driving the slower rate cut path? First thing is growth is stronger, right? The economy grew faster in the second half of 2024 so far than we had expected and is expected to be above our expectations in September next year as well. Unemployment is lower and, you know, in the SEP you'll see that participants think that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. So that's more strength, right? Inflation is higher as we talked about. Inflation is higher this year. It's also higher in the forecast next year. I'd also point out that we're closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason to be cautious about further moves. But getting to your point, there's uncertainty. Uncertainly, in the case of some people, some people, the way I would say this, some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so. Some people said they didn't do so and some people didn't say whether they did or not. So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that. But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation. And, you know, the point about uncertainty is it's kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain, you go a little bit slower. It's not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down and so that may have affected some of the people. But as I said, there's a range of approaches on the committee. If I could follow up on that, you mentioned the risk and uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document. The upside risk to inflation jumped quite substantially. The only thing really that's happened, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact. Yet the risk waiting has jumped to the upside. The only real thing that's happened is November 5th in the meantime. Is it fair to say that that's what's driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation? Actually, that's not the only thing that's happened. What's happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five tenths higher than they were in September. So you had two months of higher inflation in September and October. As I mentioned, November is back on track. But once again, we've had a year on project.",-6.607420132803136e-05,9.911948854334896e-05
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:45:00,2024-12-18 18:50:00," for inflation and it's kind of fallen apart as we've approached the end of the year. So that is certainly a large factor in people's thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations. It's still going to be between two and a half and three. It's way below where it was but we really want to see progress on inflation as I mentioned as we think about further cuts we're going to be looking for progress on inflation. We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves. That's in part because inflation was very, very low measured in the fourth quarter of 2023 and nonetheless as we go forward we're going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping us all labor market. Chris. Thank you Chris Ruggie. I had associated press. Thanks for taking the question. In September 2018 the Fed staff and in the teal book discussed a policy of looking through any new tariffs as long as there are one time increases and inflation expectations remained anchored. Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other thinking on tariffs generally that you can share? So I do think that the 2018, the September 2018 teal book alternative simulations are a good place to start. I happen to have brought them here with me today. I'm sure you have them too. They're a good starting point and I would just say it's six years old analysis but nonetheless this is still I think the right questions to ask. There were two simulations. One was seeing through, one was not. I'd point you, there's some language in the see-through pair. The situation is in which it might be appropriate to see through inflation and then name some conditions in which it might not be. In any case this is not a question that's in front of us right now. We won't face that question. We don't know when we'll face that question. What the committee is doing now is discussing pathways and understanding that again the ways in which tariff driven inflation can affect, tariffs can affect inflation in the economy and how to think about that. So we've done a bit of good bit of work all of us have. Each of us has. And it puts us in position when we finally do see what the actual policies are to make a more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response. Great, and there's a quick follow. Do you, given the recent bout of inflation that we've been through with consumers seeing how prices can rise and businesses being seen that they can raise prices at least for some time, does that make it a little bit riskier to look through tariffs? I mean, are inflated, do you feel you have to respond more quickly to inflation threats given what we've seen in the past few years? The main thing is, and this is also a point in these alternative simulations, is there are just many, many factors that go into what how much tariffs will even go into consumer inflation, how persistent will that be. So we just don't know really very much at all about the actual policies, so it's very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don't know what will be tariffed from what countries for how long and what size. We don't know whether they'll be retaliatory tariffs. We don't know what the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices to your point as well. I wouldn't say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we've just been through a period of high inflation. We've just gotten through that period. That's a difference. There was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries since that may have effects. I don't know. I just think we need to take our time, not rush, and make a very careful assessment. But only when we've actually seen what the policies are and how they're implemented. And we're just not at that stage. We're at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing, which is kind of thinking about these questions, but not trying to get to different advances for some time. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, to make sure I understand participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for 25 so that the central tendency runs from 2.5 to 2.7%. And it's how we're noted earlier most of the committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside. So if inflation only declines next year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the committee to be cutting in that situation? Let me find these numbers.",-6.608511763144929e-05,0.00014870871267810867
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:50:00,2024-12-18 18:55:00," So we have, we have, we have inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to two and a half next year. That's, that'd be a significant progress. You see a slower path. I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress, but we, you know, we'd be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level. That wouldn't be all the way to 2% but that would be, it would be, you know, better than this year. This year will be 28 or 29. That would be meaningful. We also have to think about the, you know, the labor market. And while we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling so far in an orderly gradual way. But it's also something we need to keep our eye on. I guess if I could follow up. We looked at these projections and also the insertion of the extent and timing language in the statement which has been used at times in the past when the committee thinks maybe it's going to be on hold for a while. And they said, gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time. Would they be mistaken to, to infer that? So that's, that's not the, that's not any decision that we made at all. Let me explain extent and timing. So the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about it as anticipated, we're at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts. So extent that just relates to how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance. Clearly that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points. So it's significantly smaller. So that's the extent question. And again, we're going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as a strong labor market to make those cuts. And timing just suggests again that we're at a place where we, we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we're at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustment. So that, that's what we mean by that. We're not trying to make decisions about the longer run. You know, we are, we're trying to make sensible policy as we go. And you know, I just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is, it's just, it's just a function of the fact that, that we expect significant policy changes. And I think really unusual about that, I think we need to, we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We'll have a much clearer picture, I think, you know, when that happens. Mike. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Even though you've cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven't seen much change in mortgages, auto loan rates or credit card rates. You say you're significantly restrictive. Are you running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of a slowdown than you anticipate? So to write the risks that you, sorry, the rates that you talked about are really longer run rates and they're affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they're also affected by many other things. And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as you well know. And those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short term rates do. So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions and then we look at what's happening in the economy. So what we see happening in the economy again is, you know, most forecasters have been calling for a slowdown in growth for a very long time and it keeps not happening. So we're now well into another year of growth that looks like it might be 2.5%. Third and second and third quarters were right about at the same level. So US economy is just performing very, very well, substantially better than our global peer group. And there's no reason to think a downturn is any more likely than it usually is. So the outlook is pretty bright for our economy. We have to stay on task though and continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2%. We're also going to be looking out for the labor market. We want to keep the labor market pretty close to where it is. We're pretty close to estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. Job creation is a little below the level that would keep it there, but nonetheless close. And so that's what our policy is trying to achieve. If I could follow up by asking about your formulation for beginning rate cuts included the phrase we need to have confidence that inflation is moving down towards our target. Given the fact that you raised your forecast for next year, do you have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward? So confidence was our test for raising rates. And we've made, look at the broader sweep. We've made just a great deal of progress. We're well into the tune.",-1.6516640515304162e-05,0.0001651773178507503
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:55:00,2024-12-18 19:00:00," in core inflation and around two and a half or even lower than that we have been for headline inflation. So I would say I'm confident that inflation has come down a great deal. And I'm confident in the story about why it's come down and why that portans well. And I'll tell you why. Again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we've really worried about. It really has come down now quite steadily at a slower pace than we thought two years ago. But it's nonetheless steadily coming down as market rents, market rents to equilibrate better with new leases that turn over, not new towns but new leases, market rents is new leases. So that's happening that processes on going pretty much as we expect. Goods inflation, which is another big piece of it, has returned right to the range where it was before the pandemic. Just for some months this year it kind of moved up in a bumpy way because of used cars and things like that. But we think overall that should generally be in the range. It was in that that leaves non-housing services. And market-based non-housing services are in good shape. It's non-market services and those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly. And they don't we think they don't really tell us much about the tightness in the economy. They don't really reflect that. I mean a good example is financial services, which has really done off of asset prices. And that's how that inflation works. So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down, is still intact in particular. It's a labor market. Look at the labor market. It is cooler by so many measures now. Modestly cooler than it was in 2019. A year when inflation was well under 2%. So it's not a source of inflationary pressures. Not to say there aren't regional and particular professions where labor is tight. But overall you're not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market. So what's the story? The story is still just we're unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and 22 in for example, housing services. And now also in insurance in particular where costs went up and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance. It's real inflation, but it doesn't pretend persistently high inflation. So we and most other forecasters still feel that we're on track to you know to get down to 2%. It might take another year or two from here. But I'm confident that that's the path we're on. And you know our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case. Thank you. Thank you. So the unemployment rate as of November while still very low is within spitting distance of the level that generated a lot of concern about the labor market over the summer in the lead up to the 50 basis point cut in September. Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors. But now the committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings. So what has changed about the committee's assessment of the risks confronting the labor market? Is there just less concern now on that front or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now needs to be accounted for? The unemployment rate is now the same as it was in July 4.2%. It's moved up and down, but it's now the same as July. And job creation is lower than it has been, but it's been steady. It's not declining. It's in steady at a level which as I pointed out a couple of times is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it's not so far below. So you might, you might, if we have the breaking even level right, and if jobs continue, job creation continues at that level in the establishment survey, then you would get a tenth maybe every other month kind of thing. So gradually declining, we don't have that kind of precision in this. So you're right though. And I read out some of the reasons. We do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures, and we're watching that closely. It's not cooling in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think, you pointed out, participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative to the labor market. And it's because things have just gotten a little bit better. It doesn't, you know, the unemployment rate flat and things like that. Nonetheless, you know, we're watching it closely. If the idea though is that no additional kind of softening the labor market is welcome here, what's to prevent that from happening if rates are still restrictive? So what I said is we don't think we need for their self.",0.0001486227624017,0.0001981669556601512

You know, if you had a situation where inflation is moving around by a tenth every few months, that's, you know, we'd have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has, in recent months, been moving sideways in the 12 month window. And so we've got a way on both at this point. You know, for a while there, we were only really focused mainly focused on inflation. We've now gotten to a place where the risks of the two are, or we think are broadly, roughly in balance. And so that's how we think about it. Steve. Mr. Chairman, I did not hear you use the word recalibration today. And I'm just wondering if the recalibration phase is over. And what you might call this new phase and whether the criteria for changing rates is somehow different and higher than it was before. Thanks. We're not renaming the phase yet, but we may get around to that. But no, I would say we are, though, in a new phase in the process, as I said. And that's just because we've reduced our policy rate by 100 basis points were significantly closer to neutral. We still think where we are is meaningfully restrictive. And I think from this point forward, you know, it's appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation. We've, you know, we've done a lot to support economic activity by cutting 100 basis points. And that's a good thing. I think I support the decision. And I think it was the right decision to make. I think from now, we are in a place where the risks really are in balance. And we need to see progress on inflation. And that's how we're thinking about it. So it is kind of a new thing. We move pretty quickly to get to here. And I think going forward, obviously, when we're moving slower, which is consistent with the SEP. I wonder if I could follow up and ask you how much you or the committee are looking through some of the high numbers we've had in the recent inflation numbers. For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the avian flu, that kind of stuff. And then looking forward, perhaps, to housing inflation coming down as it did in the recent report. So we, I mean, we always try to be careful about not throwing out the numbers we don't like. You know, it's just a occupational hazard is to look at those high months are wrong. What about the low months? You know, we've got, we have a very low month, potentially in November. You know, we, it's estimated by many to be in the mid teens for core PCE. So that could be idiosyncratically low. We try to look, we try to look at not just a couple or three months. We shouldn't have our position shouldn't change based on two or three months of good or bad data. We have a long string now of inflation coming down gradually over time. As I mentioned, 12 month, I think it's 12 month headlines, two and a half, 12 month core is 2.8. That's way better than we were. We still have some work to do though, is how we're looking at it. And we need policy to remain restrictive to get that to get that worked on, we think. Neil. Thanks, Jerry. Peter, Paul, Neil Irwin from Axios. Financial markets have been very buoyant really all year. Is the committee comfortable with where financial conditions are? Or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine progress on your inflation target? So we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course, it's part of what we do. But we really look carefully at is the performance of our goal variables and how are we affecting the economy. So what we've seen over the course of just take the last year, we've seen inflation over the last couple of years come down a lot. We've seen the labor market cool off quite a bit. That suggests that our policy is restrictive. Well, we can also look more directly at the parts of the economy that are affected by that are interest sensitive, like particularly housing. Housing activity is very low and that's partly significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working, it's transmitting, and it's having the effects on our goal variables that we would want. You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know. We're really control those, but I'd say we see the effects we're hoping to see on the goal variables and the places where we'd expect to see it. So if I may, speaking of assets that have been buoyant, do you see any value or benefits in the US government building a reserve of Bitcoin? So, you know, we're not allowed down Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve X says what we can own and we're not looking for a lot change. That's the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a lot change at the Fed.

2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 19:05:00,2024-12-18 19:10:00," Happy holidays Mr. Chairman. Thanks for taking our questions. I was wondering if you are satisfied with the way 2024 is ending. If you're confident that we've avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years ago. I think it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession. I think growth this year has been solid. It really has PDFP private domestic final purchases which we think is the best indicator of private demand is looking to come in around 3% this year. This is a really good number. Again the US economy has just been remarkable. And when we, in these international meetings that I attend this has been the story. Is that how well the US is doing. If you look around the world there's just a lot of slow growth and continues struggles with inflation. So I feel very good about where the economy is and the performance of the economy. We want to keep that going. The other thing I just wanted to ask about was the, you guys have noted that the unemployment rate is still low. However employment rates have fallen rather quickly that prime age employment rate has fell by about half a point. Half a percent rather recently. The question I guess is do you think there's maybe more downside momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling? I don't think so. No, I think overall if you look at it, prime age participation is still very high. What's going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low. So if you, if you have a job you're doing very well and layoffs are very low. So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers. If you are looking for a job though the hiring rate is low and that's a signal of lower demand and it has come down. So we look for signs like that and that's clearly a sign of softening for their softening. I didn't mention it earlier but I think you can see an ongoing gradual softening in the labor market. Again, not something we need to see to get 2% inflation and that's part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with our, with the action with an additional cut. So but take a step back the level of unemployment is very low. Again, participation is high. Wages are at a healthy and ever more sustainable level at wage growth. And so the labor market, this is a good labor market and we want to keep it that way. Thanks. Come here. Thank you, Mayor Malkoi from Bloomberg News. I just want to put a finer point on the labor market. Can you keep the labor market this way in the strong position that you have described without further cuts? In other words, do you still view the labor market as needing support to protect against the further delay? We can't know that with any tremendous certainty. I will say that we think that our policy balances the risks. We think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates. And we think the labor market is in solid shape. And when I say it's softening or cooling, it's very gradual process. Job creations are meaningfully positive. Wages are, if anything, a little still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer run trend. If you take into account the high productivity readings we've had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2% inflation. So, again, I don't want to overstate the downside of the labor market because the downside clearly appeared to have diminished. Nonetheless, it's one of our mandate goals. And we pay close attention to it. And it's worth noting that it is still gradually cooling, gradually in an orderly way. And that's how I would characterize it. And that's why we're paying careful attention. The list of it. Thanks so much, Chair Powell. Elizabeth Schullzzy from ABC News. As you've noted, the Fed is now forecasting higher inflation next year. High prices are still a burden for so many households right now. Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you'd expected? It breaks down into a long answer if you want. But it just has been a little bit more stubborn. I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down we would have had to have a deeper session and high unemployment by now. Well, that has not been the case. So, the path down has actually been much better than many predicted. We've managed to have the unemployment rate remain essentially at its longer run natural rate.",-0.0015736032200891,0.0017921146953405697
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 19:10:00,2024-12-18 19:15:00," Inflation has come down from core PC, inflation has come down from 5.6% to 2.8% on a 12-month basis. So that's a pretty good outcome. Why hasn't it come down? One reason is that just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that process has been slower than market rents are showing up more slowly in that measure. And we might have thought two years ago. So that's part of it. I think there are other parts of the story. But what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that. And it's prices of food and transportation and heating your home and things like that. So there's tremendous pain in that burst of inflation that was very global. This was everywhere in all the advanced economies at the same time. So now we have inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices. And that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that's who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there. So that people are earning big, real wage increases. So that their wages are going up. Their compensation is going up faster than inflation, year upon year upon year. And that's what will restore people's good feeling about the economy. That's what it will take, and that's what we're aiming for. And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the biggest challenge to the economy under the next administration? I feel very good about where the economy is. Honestly, I'm very optimistic about the economy. And we're in a really good place. Our policies in a really good place. I expect another good year next year. Edward. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing the questions. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. So you say that we're closer to the neutral rate. What percent do you see in the committee beliefs? Where is that neutral rate? So I'll say a couple of things. First of all, when we write the thing we write down in the summary of the economic projections, is the longer run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economies in balance, and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now. So when we're making monetary policy at the Fed, that's not the question we're asking. So you can't do a straight read between those longer run numbers that we write down and what we think the appropriate policy should be. So basically, at any given time, various shocks are hitting the economy. And so what we're doing in real time is we're looking at our policy stance, and we're looking at the way it's hitting the economy. And particularly, we look at the effects it's having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability. And the answer can be that there are things that affect the economy that are lasting, but not permanent. And the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in our star. The ones that could be lasting, but not the less go away over time, they could actually affect what's sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we're looking at that, and we don't know exactly where it is. But as I like to say, we know it by its works. And I think what we know, for sure, is that we're 100-based points closer to it right now. There are many estimates of where that might be, and we know we're a lot closer to it. And I think we're in a good place, but I think from here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts. But I think that the markets are looking for a little more clarity. I've heard estimates from 2.9% to 4%. I think the markets would like to see a little more clarity about the year out, 18 months out, as to where that go post for lack of better term is, because at the moment it looks big. Yeah, honestly, there are countless models of what a neutral rate might be at any given time. There are empirical models, there are theoretical models. There are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you'd like. So there is no real certainty. And I mean, it's actually a good thing to know that we don't know exactly where it is. So you're not tempted to think, oh, I think this model or this estimate is right. You just have to be open to the empirical data that are coming in, and also how it's affecting the outlook. And it's not made any easier by the fact that our policy works with long and variable legs. And nonetheless, that is the job we have. So I think we need, it's appropriate for us now to proceed cautiously. Now that we're 100 basis points closer to neutral, and we'll do so. Meanwhile, the economy seems to be in good shape, and these cuts will certainly help to support economic activity and the labor market, while we can still make progress.",-0.0006985679357318,0.0012152286461021428
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 19:15:00,2024-12-18 19:20:00," inflation because policy is still meaningfully restrictive. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we're going to go with Policope. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation. Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation, even if a headline inflation takes up? And then also, since that's what's projected in the SCPI, I was wondering what accounts for that? Why do you all see core PC going down and potentially headline inflation taking up? So, as I imagine, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation because that's what people experience. People don't experience core inflation, they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs. So that's the overall goal. But, as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to tightness in the economy, and therefore are not really good predictors of future inflation. So it turns out that core inflation is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is. So we look at core inflation because it's a better measure of what future inflation is likely to be, because it's a better measure of what inflation pressures exist. So that's complicated, but ultimately our goal is headline, not core. So your second question was what? Why do you all see core going down, but headline potentially taking up? So headline can be affected, you're talking about next year. Yeah, so headline can be affected by energy prices and food prices. So there will be things in the headline forecast that are to do with forecast of energy prices, whereas core will be, if you look at core going out a full year, then it will be much more driven by things like tightness in the economy. So that's why the two can go in different directions. We headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year. That's because energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people, but energy prices will come down and then they will go up, and it won't really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how future inflation will perform. Do geopolitical risks factor in it all to how you're thinking about energy prices? So we monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but really carefully, rather. But I would say so far those risks haven't really, nothing has come out of those risks that really has really been important for the United States economy. The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we're talking about the Middle East and Ukraine, and that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong in with global turmoil. But the price of oil has been coming down, and for because of supply conditions, global supply conditions. So we don't the US is not feeling really the effects of geopolitical turmoil, but we are certainly at a time of elevated geopolitical turmoil, and it remains a risk. Kelly. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kelly O'Grady from CBS News. I want to go back to something that you said a minute ago that wage growth is outpacing inflation now. It wasn't the case for some time, of course. It's partly why Americans haven't felt much relief in their wallets from prices yet. But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you, the progress in closing that gap could go away? Yeah, so inflation, again, we don't over react to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple of months of lower readings. And what we had was we had four months of really nice readings, and then September and October were higher, but then November is much lower. So I don't really think the public is experiencing that as a surprising upside risk to inflation. I think inflation is much lower. What the public is feeling, and they're right about it, is that prices are just the price level went up because of the past inflation. And it's going to take some time for real wages to recover over a period of years in which your real compensation is growing, in other words, your compensation is growing meaningfully faster than inflation. That's exactly the kind of economy we have now, and we just want to hold on to it. That process probably takes some years, but that's what's going on right now. And I don't think that a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that anything of the nature you're suggesting. And just one follow up. Let's look more long term. You previously predicted hitting the 2% inflation target in 2026. It's now been pushed out to 2027. You said you're focused on enabling further progress on inflation. That's not necessarily progress in the right direction. Are you confident?",-0.0005857470438078,0.0011822692909715196

We're talking about when you're projecting the economy three years out, two years out, you're talking about high uncertainty, very high uncertainty. You know, we really, at that point, it's not... That's not possible to confidently predict what the economy is going to be in three years. So what we're doing is we're looking at what's happening now. We're kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening. So we keep a strong labor market. Housing services inflation comes down. Goods and services, goods and inflation settles down. And, you know, non-market services return to their prior level. All of those things should happen over time. And, you know, those pieces come together. There's every reason to think that they will. The timing of it is highly uncertain. You know, but you're not wrong, though, that, you know, it's been a bit frustrating because the... While we've made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped. Nonetheless, we're still on track. And, you know, I think if you two years ago you'd said we were at 4.2% unemployment and 2.8% inflation, people would be... I would say I'll take that. I mean, that's a pretty good interim place to be. Job's not done. But I think we're feeling good about where we are and where we're headed. Could a Nancy for the last question? Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall-Gencer from Marketplace. You said a couple times inflation has been moving sideways. You know, it appears to be settling in around... Excuse me, 2.5%. Do you think the Fed is just going to have to settle for that and accept that you're not going to get to your 2% target? No, we're not going to settle for that. I think we're... You know, we certainly have every intention and expectations that we'll get inflation back sustainably to 2%. That is... And I am confident we will achieve that. It has taken longer, but you have to be... You know, we are making progress. We have made a great deal of progress and we'll continue to do so and get back to 2% inflation. That's what we owe the public and we're committed to achieving it. In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year? You don't rule things completely in or out in this... in this world. That doesn't appear to be a likely outcome. I think we're 4.3%. That's meaningfully restrictive. And I think it's a well-calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while keeping a strong labor market. So thank you very much.",0.0006827643630307,0.000766053823607841
