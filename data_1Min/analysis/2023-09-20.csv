My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We've raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We've covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.",0.0,0.0034598163809867774

Looking ahead, we are in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace and so far this year growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particularly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat that it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investments.",0.0,0.0

Participants expect growth to cool with the median projection falling to 1.5% next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless well below that scene earlier in the year. The unemployment rate ticked up in August, but remains low at 3.8%. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.

Based on the consumer price index or CPI and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4% over the 12 months ending in August, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9%.

Nevertheless, the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2% has a long way to go.

The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation.

In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 and a quarter to 5 and a half percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our security's holdings.

In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary sub-policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.

And we say we're committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that's officially restrictive to bring down inflation to 2% of our time. We said that. But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean that we've decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we're seeking.

So it's something where we're by by we're not making a decision by by deciding to about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data. So right now it's still an open question about sufficiently restrictive you're not saying today that we've reached this level. We're not saying no. No clearly we are just what we decided it was maintain the policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level and then you know we're we're seeing progress and we welcome that but you know we need to see more progress before we'll be willing to to reach that conclusion.

It's accumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people. And what you're seeing are the median. So I wouldn't want to, you know, bestow upon it the idea that it's really a plan. But what it reflects, though, is that economic activity's been stronger than we expected. Stronger than I think everyone expected.

How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding study? Is it discussion around log times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing? Could you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting? Yeah, so the proposal at the meeting was to maintain our current policy stance. And I think there was obviously unanimous support for that. But this, of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think. And you've got some, you saw, I think, seven wrote down no hike at this meeting, or between now and the end of the year, and I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the year.

We want to see that it's more than just three months, right? We want to see, you know, the labor market report that we received, the last one that received, was a good example of what we do want to see. It was a combination of across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market. So those are the two things. So those are our two mandate variables, and that's the progress that we want to see. But I think people, they want to be convinced, you know, they want to be careful to not to jump to a conclusion really one way or the other, but just be convinced that the data, you know, support that conclusion.

So you know, you can make the argument that one hike, one where the other won't matter, but for us, we're trying, obviously as a group, it's a pretty tight cluster of where we think that policy stance might be, but we're always going to be learning from data. We've learned all through the course of the last year that actually we needed to go further than we had thought. If you go back a year and what we thought, what we wrote down, it's actually gotten higher and higher. So we don't really know until, and that's why again, we've grown a position to proceed carefully at this point. A year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up. Now, we're fairly close, we think, to where we need to get. It's just a question of reaching the right stance. I wouldn't attribute huge importance to one hike in macroeconomic terms.

What is it saying about the committee's view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year, but need another half a point over the funds rate on it?

So I guess I would point more to, rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn't think that's not, we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data. It's more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So if I had to attribute one thing, again, we're picking a median here and trying to attribute one explanation, but I think broadly, stronger economic activity means rates, we have to do more with rates, and that's what that meaning is telling you.

That's another reason why we're moving carefully now because there are lags here. So it may of course be that the neutral rate has risen. You do see people, you don't see the median moving, but you do see people raising their estimates of the neutral rate. And it's certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than the longer run rate. Remember what we write down in the SEP is the longer run rate. It is certainly possible that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that. And that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than expected.

So the fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply, healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this? Yes, of course, it is a good thing that we've seen now, meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment. And that's because we're seeing that rebalancing in other places, in, for example, job openings, and in the jobs worker gap. You've also seen supply side things. So that's happening. I would say, though, I still think, and I think broadly, people still think that we'll have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we've seen as well.

So all of those things are happening. You're right in the median forecast we don't see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase. But that really is just playing forward the trends that we've been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that. But that's really what we've been seeing is progress without higher unemployment for now. So just to boil that down for a second, we've gone from a very narrow path to a soft landing to something different. Would you crawl to soft landing now a baseline expectation? No, no.

And I also think this is why we're a position to move carefully again. That we will restore price stability. We know that we have to do that. Then we know that public depends on us doing that.

And can you explain what would constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive?

We're seeing through a combination of the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policies work in suppressing demand or alleviating very high demand. The combination of those two things is actually working. You're seeing inflation coming down. It's principally now in goods, also in housing services. We begin to see effects of it in non-housing services as well. So I think we think that that is working.

Following up on next question actually, John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of next year as we see inflation kind of again to next point, as we see inflation coming down, we're going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we're not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time.

We see rising oil prices, we see auto workers striking, where there's the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering for each of those things, could you talk about how you're thinking about how that might affect the course for the Fed and the economy? So there is a long list and you hit some of them. It's the strike, it's government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long-term rates, oil price shock. There are a lot of things that you can look at. And so what we try to do is assess all of them and the handicap all of them. And ultimately though, there's so much uncertainty around these things. To start with the strike, first of all, we absolutely don't comment on the strike as we have no view on the strike one way or the other.

The economic effects, it could affect, we've looked back at history, it could affect economic output, hiring and inflation. But that's really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it's sustained for. And then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for loss production. So none of those things are known right now. It's very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that uncertain and we'll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period, much more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, I don't know if you mentioned shutdown. And I think of all of these as being on the list. We don't comment on that. It hasn't traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.

We have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well. Those are some of mine a much if I hit them all. But ultimately, you're coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum. And that's what we start with, but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. I was a little surprised, Chair Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy seeing added supply and a weight that could create long term inflation stability. We have primage labor force participation moving up where people can add skills. Workers want to work.

And if we lose that in a recession, aren't we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into account as you pursue policy? Thank you. To begin, a soft landing is a primary objective and I did not say otherwise. I mean, that's what we've been trying to achieve for all this time. The real point though is the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability because the record is clear on that. If you don't restore price stability, inflation comes back and you go through what you can have a long period where the economy is just very uncertain and it will affect growth, it will affect all kinds of things.

When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling the low-hanging fruit, such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions, or is it more of a broad, disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the...",-0.0013105987277843001,0.0

I think we knew from the time, from before when we lifted off, it's certainly by the time we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going to help. It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off. And just in general, a better aligning supply with demand. So those two forces were always going to be important. I think it's very hard to pull them apart. They work together.

You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So, what would justify that last move because the median forecast is for lower inflation and given all the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have can investors have or the American people have in your forecasts? Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult. Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to your question, though, what's happened is growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected. And that's required higher rates.

Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think people should know that economic forecasting is very difficult and these are highly uncertain forecasts. But these are our forecasts.

It really comes down to how persistent, how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn't, energy prices mostly, mostly don't contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don't tell you much about where inflation is really going. However, we're well aware, though, that, you know, if an energy price is the increase and stay high, that'll have an effect on spending. And it may have an effect on consumer expectations of inflation and things like that. That's just things we have to monitor. So, on the consumer, they're putting more and more of this on their credit card.

Of course, everyone's got models that will give you a very precise answer, but they'll give you different answers. Essentially, they're moving up because it's not because of inflation.

But there's also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market.

And then as far as a constraint housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?
