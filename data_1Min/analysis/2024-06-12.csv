2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.7%, but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with sub...",0.0,0.0018077845415975246

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, to 1.3% in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases, which excludes inventory investment, government spending, and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand. Grue at 2.8% in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year's robust pace, but remains solid.

In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong but a bit below that scene in the first quarter. The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low at 4 percent. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Non-always growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed.

The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year. Inflation is eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. The global PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. The consumer price index which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE price index rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May. And the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.

The median projection in the SCP for total PCE inflation is 2.6 percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.

The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. So far this year, they'd have not given us that greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable in earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective. We'll need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress that we've seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.",0.0,0.0024369080805657505

In our SCP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1% at the end of this year, 4.1% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2026. But these projections are not a committee plan or any kind of a decision.

The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.

Just wondering if you could walk me through the committee's average inflation forecast. Core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8% by the year end. It's already 2.75. And after today's number, there were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month. Does that tell you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation? And in fact, it's going to get worse. And if you have this wrong, doesn't it mean that you sort of you could have wrong the outlook for rates there? Yeah, so what's going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half last year, June through December, really. And we're now lapping those. So as you go through the 12 month.",0.0,0.0

So it's just a slight element of conservativeism that we're assuming a certain level of incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers. We're assuming a good but not great numbers. And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12 month reading. Now do we have high confidence that that's right? No, it's just a kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today's reading, then of course that wouldn't be the case. So it's just a forecasting device. I think let me say that we welcome today's reading and then hope for more like that. But if it comes in just to follow up, it comes in the way you forecast it. It would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE. Thank you.",0.0,0.0

And that's the test we've applied. I don't know that this rules that in or out. I mean, really, it's a forecast, a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12 months rates by the end of the year. If we get, you know, good, better ratings in that, then you will see that come down or remain the same. If you're at 2.6, 2.7, you know, that's a really good place to be. Nick.

So as far as the SCP part of that is concerned, as you know I talk to all of the other participants on the FMC every cycle and we talk about their summer of economic projections and the dot plot and everything and what I hear and see is that people are looking at a range of plausible outcomes and in many cases they are thinking I can't really distinguish between two of these. They are so close for me. These are very close calls but we ask them to write down the most likely one so they do.

No one brings to this or takes away from it that is on the committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path. It's actually just their forecast and it's a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function. But again everyone would say that this is very data dependent and I don't hold it with high confidence. And I think if you're looking for and don't really think that they're not trying to send a strong signal that this is what I think is the right thing. It's just what they think at a given moment in time subject to data. In terms of future meetings we haven't tried to, we don't make decisions about future meetings until we get there.

You look at all of that and you ask, are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent? Or alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response, which is another thing that could happen? But again, we don't see that. And we do see today's report as progress and as building confidence. But we don't see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant, that would warrant beginning to loosen policy at this time.

As you noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic. I wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that. So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2% or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that many of those imbalances have eased? Sure, so by so many measures the labor market was kind of overheated two years ago. And we've seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand. So what have we seen? We've seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That's ongoing mostly now through the immigration channel, but still we've had some increases in prime age labor force. In terms of on the demand side.",0.0,0.001588356973995087

We've seen wage increases moving from very, very high levels, a couple of years ago, back down to more sustainable levels. We have seen unemployment creep up now six tents over the course of a year or so, very, very gradually. So we put all that together, which you have is still low unemployment, still 4% unemployment historically low. But it's moved up a little bit. It's softened a bit. And that's an important statistic. But more than that, you've got strong job creation. You have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though there's an argument that they may be a bit overstated, but still they're strong. So that's what we see. We watch the labor market, of course, in the economy as a whole, but the labor market very carefully. And that's what we see.

There's been some divergence especially we saw in the last report that we got on Friday. So how do you interpret that and how does it change your view on the labor market? So sometimes it's you can't reconcile the differences you just have to have to look at it and try to understand and that's why it always makes sense to look at a series you know in six and three six and twelve months of things rather than just one report. You're right to point to the last report where there was your job losses in the household survey, job gains, big job gains in the establishment survey. So I mean we're left with ambiguous results and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling, gradually rebalancing labor market.

So overall, we're looking at what is still a very strong labor market, but not the superheated labor market of two years ago, or even one year ago. Thanks, Dr. Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Back on the rates path, the SEP showed quite large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March. That's a period in which the economic data flow hasn't been that dramatic a shift. How can you provide some color on what changed attitudes on the committee of the last three months to see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year? Yeah, the big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the inflation forecast moved up several tents for the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier in the, you know, what, what did we take away from this? We had really, really good inflation data in the second half of last year than kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.

So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in, might have taken place this year, take place next year. You know, we, we, there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there's one more next year. So, so you really, if you look at year end 2025 and 26, you're almost exactly where you would have been, just it, just it's moved later because of that progress. Now you get another, you get data, different data today. So we'll have to see where the data light the way. You know, we're, we're at, the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.

In the summary of economic projections, the long run interest rate forecast moved up a bit. I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not as restrictive as we previously expected. How should we interpret what that means about how the committee views its current policy setting? So two things about that. One is this. You're right, it did move up. But I want to remember to point out that long run neutral rate of interest is a long run concept. It really is a theoretical concept can't be directly observed. And what it is is the interest rate they would hold the economy at equilibrium, maximum employment and price stability, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks. So it's a little bit, it's not something we observe today. Today we've got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks. We're still getting over from the pandemic.",0.0,0.0018293358956354801

But honestly, it doesn't really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term. But back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren't going to are less likely to go down to their pre-pandemic levels, which were very low by recent history. Now, we can't really know that. That's an interesting dispute and discussion to have now. But ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer-run slow-moving forces.

And, you know, my answer has been, the policy is restrictive, the question of whether it's sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we know over time.

That's what we're thinking about. You can translate it into the language you're talking about. But to me, the focus is more on we have a goal which is price stability and another goal which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we've got a good strong labor market still. We think we've been making progress toward the price stability goal. And then for a while there was a pause and we look at today's thing and we think, well, that's a good reading.

So just to follow up on that, I think what curious thing here is you've got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the major things for all of this year. You've got growth that stays above long run potential throughout the forecast period. Pun employment that never goes above the long run estimate, right, of 4.2. So this isn't a story of slack improving inflation. So where's the improvement in inflation coming from that it's going to pick up pace so much in 2025? Well, it's been coming, where's it been coming from? We'll start with that. Clearly, some of what we've been getting is just the reversal of the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.

So you've had above trend potential growth and at high growth and yet you've had the benefit of inflation coming down, you know, really fast actually last year and you will see what the rest of this year brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. I mean, ultimately the question is ultimately, are you down to demand? We don't know that though. I mean, we're looking at today's report, you know, if we see more like that, you know, we can't know what the future holds.

So if at the end of the year there is no change from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates? What would be the point for a rate cut? Well, we think policy is restrictive. And we think ultimately that if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy. So that's always been the thought is that since we raise rates this far, we've always been pointing to cuts at a certain point, not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but no one has that as their base case.

Well, in housing, housing situation is a complicated one. And you can see that's a place where rates are really having a significant effect. I mean, ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.

And it's not something we're looking at changing or we'd look at changing anytime soon. But it's true.
