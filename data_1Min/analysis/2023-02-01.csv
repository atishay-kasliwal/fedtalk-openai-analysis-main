2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:30:00,2023-02-01 18:31:00," Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Over the past year we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points.",0.0,0.0011865621832744622

In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 1%. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates.",0.0,0.0

Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be out of balance. Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. And the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. With a 12 months ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0%. Excluding the...",-0.0014701303895871,0.0

The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.

My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to a returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal front's rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.5 to 4.3 quarters percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year.

We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. People take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step down from last year's rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, as we determine the extent of future increases that we required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.

Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions.",0.0,0.0

As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which is also brought down mortgage rates in the stock market posted a solid game in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder and could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in or to offset the easing of financial conditions? So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy or strength that we're putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2%. And of course financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. It is our judgment that we're not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be a...",5.8788059500699933e-05,0.0

And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we said policy. Rachel. Hi Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter we've seen a deceleration in prices, in wages and a fall in consumer spending. All while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low, does this at all change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up if at all to see inflation come down to the levels you're looking for? So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage.",0.0,0.0

So you see that in the other, in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while, but then to come down assuming that new leases continue to be lower. So in those two sectors, you've got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called non-housing, core non-housing services where we don't see disinflation yet. But I would say that so far what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go change since December?

So we'll update those forecasts in March. Neil. Hi Chair Powell, Neil Irwin with Axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December Jolt's morning job openings actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? So you're right about the data of course. We did see, we've seen our jar early earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.",0.0,0.0010382675763868682

I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, but nonetheless, you're right. We do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And quits are still at an elevated level. So by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong. But Colby and the Nihale. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times.

At the December meeting we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be and that's obviously back in December and the median for that was between five and five and a quarter percent. At the March meeting we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to two percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground and financial decisions are certainly tightened. I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.

If we come to the view that we need to write down, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that at the same time. If the data come in in the other direction, then we'll make data dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course. Just as quick follow up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in six or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. And inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage.

So I do think that in this situation where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, the job is not fully done. As I mentioned, I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56% of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it, it's not happening yet. The inflation in the core services ex housing is still running at 4% on a six and 12 month basis. So there's not nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing less than 50%, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible that's coming together, although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline, right?

There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector. And they should be coming into play to have inflation, the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But so far, we don't see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do. How are you? Hi, Howard, I'm Robert Throydres, and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation disease. Has these? That's new. You've taken out references to the war in Ukraine as causing prices increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher. Yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come.

So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. This is what we thought would happen to the very beginning and now here it is actually happening and for the reasons we thought. It's supply change, it's shortages and it's demand revolving back toward services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's around a quarter of the PCE price index, core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services and that's driven by very different things.

And we actually see disinflation in the good sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down, that this is good. We expect to see that disinflation process will be seen, we hope, soon, in the core goods X housing. Sorry, the core services X housing sector that I talked about. We don't see it yet. It's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them that are the same. And we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60% of that is research which show is sensitive to slack in the economy.

I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet. Until we do, I think we see ourselves, we've got to be honest with ourselves. We see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent, we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to complete the job.

Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? So we've raised rates four and a half percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think because inflation is still running very hot. We're, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that.

An unwinding of these factors in other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Thanks. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, you're right. If you take very short-term three-month-say measures of PCE, core PCE, inflation, they're quite low right now.

So that's really where the sustainable level is, is more like at 4%. So that would suggest there's work left to do. You know, let's say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible. As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policies data dependent, we would take that into account. In terms of the non, sorry, the core non-housing services, as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60% of that subsector, of that sector, are we think are sensitive to slack in the economy sensitive to the labor market in a way.

I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you're not going to have a sustainable return to 2% inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market. And I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften.

The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior business cycles. And now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought. And we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think a story will emerge on the non-housing services sector soon enough. But I think there is ongoing disinflation and we don't yet see weakening in the labor market. So we'll have to see. Can we get there with a 5%? Certainly possible. Yeah, absolutely, it's possible. It's a question. No one really knows. I think it's because this is not like the other business cycles.",0.0,0.0

My base case is that the economy can return to 2% inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. And I think that's a possible outcome. I think many, many forecasters would say it's not the most likely outcome, but I would say there's a chance of it. Michael? Michael Bikki from Bloomberg TV and Radio, I'd like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation.

So I'm wondering if you have changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward. And whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place which calls for more restraint on your part. So I do think you most forecast and my own assessment would be that growth will continue, positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of GDP growth of 1% last year and also final sales growth which we think is a better indicator of about 1%. I think most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year.

The labor market remains very, very strong. And that's job creation, that's wages, as inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also, state and local governments are really flush these days with money and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support, they're also spending a lot. There's a lot of spending coming in a construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year.

You said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you think? You mentioned three months, we've seen three months in a row, Governor Walder suggested he might want to see six months. As it is just the inflation data or do you have to see the labor market coming back into a better balance to have that substantially more evidence. So I don't think there's going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating accumulation of evidence. So of course we'll be looking by the time of the March meeting, we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will, and we'll be asking ourselves what are they telling us. And soon after that we'll have another ECI wage report, which as you know is a report that we...",0.005665051148796001,0.0

It shows wages coming down, but still at a high level. There's still at a level that's way above where they were before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say, though, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2% inflation for the benefit of the American public. We're not, market participants have a very different job. It's a fine job. It's a great job. I did that job for years, but in one form or another. But we have to deliver that. And so we are strongly resolved that we will complete.",0.0,0.0

We had solid job growth, slight falling in the increase in consumer spending. It seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to, from a 9.1% CPI inflation to 6.5% CPI inflation. Is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2? I don't think we know, honestly. You know, the, so we of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021 and it didn't come down all through 22 and now it's coming down pretty fast.

And in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster. That's a different thing. If that happens, inflation comes down much faster, then we'll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon, you're going to be with the economist. I may ask a further question about the language around ongoing increases. That of course implies at least two further rate rises.

I think that's the bigger part of that. So again, as I just mentioned, our participants have different forecasts, but generally those forecasts over four continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market, but not a recession, not a recession. And we have inflation moving down into the somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year. We'll update that in March, but that's what we thought in December. Markets are past that. They show inflation coming down in some cases much quicker than that. So we'll just have to see. And we have a different view, and a different view to different forecasts, really.

One of the changes in the statement this month is that the committee is no longer listening public health as a matter of data points you'll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that? Does the federal reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy? That's the general sense of it.

And I'm wondering if you agree with that. I do. Yeah, I do. I don't see that yet. But the whole point is, once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that effectively in people's decision-making, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens, that's what we can't allow to happen.

By the way, I think it's becoming less salient. And people are, you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I've seen some data too that show people are, you know, gradually, they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now. And they're very, very low with 3.5 percent unemployment. And, you know, high wage increases, is nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. So that's what you're looking at most closely is consumer expectations.

And in this case, I would say the risk eight months ago or so longer term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are, it seemed to be well anchored, including at the shorter end. Now, not just the longer end. So, I think that's very reassuring. I think the markets have decided and the public has decided that inflation is going to come back down to 2%. And it's just a matter of us following through. That's measurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down. That will be part of the process of getting it down.

We put it this way it's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place.

I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster to that drop debt ceiling deadline. Could it play an effect as we get closer to that drop debt deadline this summer? Hi, look, it's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two because I believe Congress will wind up acting and as it will and must in the end to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk the progress we're making against inflation and the economy.",0.0,0.0
