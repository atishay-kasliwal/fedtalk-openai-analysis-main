Before I go into the details of today's meeting, I'd like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the American people. Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we're moving expeditiously to bring it back down. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy in the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight, and inflation is much too high.",0.0,0.011799908303371024

In addition, we are beginning the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. After expanding at a robust 5.5 percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter. Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely reflected swings in inventories and net exports to volatile categories whose movements last quarter likely carry little signal for future growth. Indeed household spending and business fixed investment continue to expand briskly. The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.

Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. Employers are having difficulties filling job openings and wages arising at the fastest pace in many years. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12-month ending in March, total PCE prices rose 6.6 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. Disruptions to supply have been larger, and longer lasting than anticipated.",0.014285409948410599,0.0

The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that result from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions as well. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine. Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain. In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creating spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels.

We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to restoring price stability. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting and it will continue to do so. At today's committee meeting, at today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point and stated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.

We'll make our decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal. With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our securities holdings. Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a predictable manner. By allowing the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet, up to monthly cap amounts. For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $60 billion per month.

For agency mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be 17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase the $35 billion per month. At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount. Our balance sheet decisions are guided by our maximum employment and price stability goals and in that regard, will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.

How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What does this imply for your inflation forecast? And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession? Thanks. Thank you. So you're right, 3.6% unemployment is just about as low as it's been in 50 years. And I would say that I expect and committee members generally expect that we'll get some additional participation. So people will be coming back into the labor force. We've seen that particularly among prime age people. And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. But I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow. Job creation has been more than half a million per month in recent months.",0.0,0.0

And so we think with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation. Whereas for inflation, really that really the wages matter a fair amount for companies particularly in the service sector, wages are running high, the highest they are running quite some time. And they are one good example of our good illustration really of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that is because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through our policies, through further healing in the labor market, higher rates for example.",0.0,0.0

We like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that therefore wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases but not but ones that are more consistent with 2% inflation. That's our expectation. Your third question was your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downturn. So I guess I would say it this way. There's a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level. There are 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11 and a half million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people. And we haven't been in that place on the vacancy.",0.0,0.01062827476806236

So in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and as a result, and they could come down fairly significantly. And I think put supply and demand at least closer together than they are, and that that would give us a chance to have lower, get to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there's a path to that. Now I would say I think we have a good chance to have a soft or soft-ish landing or outcome if you will, and I'll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is households and businesses are in very strong financial shape. You're looking at excess savings on balance sheets excess in the sense that they're substantially larger than the prior trend.",0.0,0.0

And so it doesn't seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. Therefore, the economy is strong in his well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. But I'll say, I do expect that this will be very challenging. It's not going to be easy. And it may well depend, of course, on events that are not under our control.

So 75 basis point in an increase is not something the committee is actively considering. What we are doing is we raised 50 basis points today. And we've said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there's a broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis increases should be on 50 basis point, or should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we're going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we'll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook, as well as the financial conditions. And finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve.

We've seen some evidence that the core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out. We want to know more than just some evidence. We want to really feel like we're making some progress there. But I mean, we're going to make these decisions and there will be a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It's a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So we're leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there. I'm sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate towards a lower increase in the funds rate or a- I don't think the one month is not- No, one month's reading would not- it doesn't tell us much.

As I said, we've got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we're not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled. That inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down. But again, it's not like we would stop. We would just go back to 25 basis point increases. It'll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. Again, our expectation is if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 basis point increases on the table, the next two meetings. Thanks. It's going to Colby. Thank you.

When we talk about the neutral rate, we're really talking about the rate that neither pushes, neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down. So it's a concept, really. It's not something we can identify with any precision. So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty. And the current estimates on the committee are sort of 2% to 3%. And also, that's a longer run estimate. That's an estimate for an economy that's at full employment and 2% inflation. So really what we're doing is we're raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral. But we know that there's not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there. So we're going to be looking at financial conditions, right?

It's that so if that path happens to evolve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral then we will not hesitate to go to those levels. We won't. But again, there's a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don't really feel. You know it's you're going to raise rates and you're going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions and of course if higher rates are required then we won't hesitate to deliver them.

We don't really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable. I think if you see, look at short-term inflation expectations, they're quite elevated. And you can look at that and say, well, that's because people expect inflation to come down. And in fact, inflation expectations come down fairly sharply. Long-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable, but have moved up to, but only to levels where they were in 2014 by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think that's a fair description of the picture, but it's really about the risks. We don't see a wage-price spiral.

So again, you don't see those things yet, but I would say there's no basis for feeling comfortable about that. It's a risk that we simply can't run that risk. We can't allow a wage-price spiral to happen, and we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It's just something that we can't allow to happen. And so we'll look at it that way. Thanks, Gina. Great. Thanks, Chair Powell. Gina's my look at the New York Times. You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.

And to the extent we can't affect really oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that. So we can't affect those. But there's a job to do on demand. And that you can see that in the labor market where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers. And you can see it in the product markets as well. But I guess I'm just pointing out that a couple of things. For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they're likely to both add to headline inflation. And people are going to be suffering from that. People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks than. But even though they don't actually tell us much about the future path.

I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play and inflation. And I'm just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back down to your 2% mandate require that these supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said, or will you have to crimp?",0.0,0.0

So, you know, I'll just say for now we're focused on doing the job we need to do on demand and there's plenty to be done there. Again, if you look at it's essentially almost two to one vacant job vacancies to unemployed people. There's a lot of access to demand. There are more than five million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force. So, there's an imbalance there that we have to do our work on. It's a very difficult situation if you look at core inflation which wouldn't include the commodity price shocks. That's one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that because we can have more of an effect on that but it would be a very difficult situation.

You cited the 1.9 to 1 figure so often now I got to ask you what would be a good figure there? What would you like to see that come down to to think that you're sort of a noninflationary vacancy to unemployed rate? And secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels? Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year. How are you mapping that into household consumption? Have they come down enough? Do you need another leg down and equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate you need to stop spending? Okay, so in terms of the vacancies on employment ratio, we don't have a goal in mind. There's no specific number that we're saying we've got to get to that.

It also depends on how well the matching function in the labor markets are working because the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that and the beverage curve shifts out and that also tends to help. So there was a specific number. I will say we were at, I think when we got to one to one in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number. But again, we're not shooting for any particular number. What we'd like to see is progress, but we're not really looking at that. That's an intermediate variable. We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation. So there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as, you know, intracensitive spending and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly.

That's what we're here for. One of the main things we're here for. Perhaps the most fundamental thing we're here for.

And we see household spending and business investment as fairly strong, even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So, and the labor market, you look at the labor market for people who are out of work and looking there are lots of job opportunities for wages are moving up and at rates that haven't been seen in quite a long time. So, it's a very, it's a good time to be a worker looking to, looking to either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job. So, it's a strong economy.

Last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic, as I mentioned, growth over 5 percent. But most forecasters have growth this year at a solid pace, above 2 percent. But we've talked with economists who have advised Democrats and Republican presidents, who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable. So, as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession, without a severe downturn and without materially high higher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So I see a strong economy now, I see a very strong labor market, for example.",0.0,0.0

So there should be room in principle to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work. The issue will come that we don't have precision surgical tools. We have essentially interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance. And they're famously blunt tools. They're not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. It's no one thinks this will be easy. No one thinks it's straightforward. But there's certainly a plausible path to this. And I do think we've got a good chance to do that. And our job is not to rate the chances. It is to try to achieve it. So that's what we're doing. There are a range of opinions, though. And that's only appropriate. Steve, Dorsey. OK.

And we look at a bizarre job to what given all the factors that are happening to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability. So if the Congress of the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I'm not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that. It's really not our role. We need to stand our lane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can give other people advice. Right now, we need to focus on doing our job. And I'll stick to that.

A number of your colleagues have said that rates will need to go above neutral and to a restrictive territory to bring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And two, you've recently spoke in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the quick courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s. And while it's certainly not your desire, and the soft landing is the big hope of everyone, would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary? So I think it's certainly possible that we'll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral. We can't know that today. That decision is not in front of us today.

You're really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it, you're looking at financial conditions and how that's affecting the economy and making a judgment. We won't be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one. It's much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we're absolutely prepared to do that. It wouldn't hesitate if that's what it's taken. So I am, of course, who isn't an admiral Paul Volcker. I shouldn't be singled out in this respect, but I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. But I would phrase it this way, he had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing. That's what it was. It wasn't a particular thing.

Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anybody, really. And so it's really essential, particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very longest expansion cycle in our recorded history. In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles. And it was, you know, racial wealth and income, not wealth, but income gaps were coming down wage gaps. So it's a really great thing. We'd all love to get back to that place, but to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability.

So it's been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that's coming out the other side and we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it's obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have numerous supply shocks which are famously difficult to deal with. So I guess that's how we think about it.

I mean, shouldn't it be what else do you need to see in order to determine that, wouldn't the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point? Thank you. So I said necessary, I meant to say appropriate. We're not gonna be erecting a high barrier for this. It's more, if we think it's appropriate. You know, the point is we're very long away from neutral now. We're moving there expeditiously, and we'll continue to do so. And we don't have to make, we can't make that decision really today. The decision for about how high to go will get, will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral. And you know, I expect we'll get there expeditiously, as I've mentioned.

I wouldn't read anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet. You know, we run these models and everyone does in this field and make estimates of what will be the, how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of, of a balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing. And, you know, these are very uncertain. I really can't be any clearer. There won't be any, any clearer. You know, people estimate that, broadly on the path we're on. And this is, this will be taken probably too seriously, but, but sort of one quarter percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace.

So in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting very appropriately, not to bless any particular day's measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. I mean, it's, monetary policy is working through expectations now to a very large extent. We've only done two rate increases, but if you look at, if you look at financial conditions, the two year is at 280 now in September, I think it was at 20 basis points. And that's all through the economy. People are feeling those higher rates already. And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.

To expand on Steve's question about Paul Volker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well. Higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses. And wondering how you kind of square what might be demand destruction. Are you already seeing that is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending to decrease consumption to perhaps table business investments? Is that essentially what's happening through this hiking cycle? Thanks. Well, as I mentioned, you can see places where their demand is substantially an excess of supply and what you're seeing as a result of that is prices going up and unsustainable levels that are not consistent with 2% inflation. And so what our tools do is as we raise interest rates, demand moderates, and it moves down.",0.0,0.0

But ultimately, getting supply and demand back in balance is what gives us 2% inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation. I mean, so yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that. But the big pain is in not dealing over time, which is in not dealing with inflation, in allowing it to become entrenched.

If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports and inflation that actually, months by month inflation had come down until September, a few months in a row, stayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said no. This is a much stronger economy. And by the way, then with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year, but that hadn't happened yet.

Hi, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I want to ask how you're able to balance your dual mandate, stable prices, and maximum employment, especially when the unemployment rate for black workers is still roughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers. So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that's one thing I would say, and that's important. But the bigger point is this, I do not at this time see the two sides of the mandate as in tension. I don't, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance.

And companies can't hire and wages are moving up at levels that would not over time be consistent with 2% inflation over time. And of course, everyone loves to see wages go up. And it's a great thing. But you want them to go up at a sustainable level. Because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation. So what that really means is to get the kind of labor market we really want to get. We really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower income part of the distribution, especially them. To do that, you've got to have price stability. And we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation. And where we can have a long expansion, too.
