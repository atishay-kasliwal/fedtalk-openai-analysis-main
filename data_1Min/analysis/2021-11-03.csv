At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero, and in light of the progress the economy has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases. With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery. Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. I will say more about our monetary policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments. Economic activity expanded at a 6.5% pace in the FOMC.",0.0,0.0011254436845294386

The recovery has also been restrained by supply constraints in bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry. As a result, both households spending and business investment flattened out last quarter. Nonetheless, aggregate demand has been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.

As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with the rise in COVID cases. In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July. This low down has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality and education. The unemployment rate was 4.8% in September. This figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued. Some of the softness in participation likely reflects the aging of the population and retirements. But participation for prime aged individuals also remains well below pre-pandemic levels.

Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic, specifically the effects on supply and demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself. We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and transportation. Our tools cannot ease supply constraints. Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply and demand imbalances, and that as it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2% longer run goal.

Chair Powell, the markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year. Are they wrong? So I would say it this way. We try to focus on what we can control and that is how to communicate clearly as possible in this highly uncertain world, how we're thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases which are frequent where the economy evolves in unexpected ways.

Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year and elevated inflation as well. And that as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate and job growth will move back up. And as that happens, inflation will decline from today's elevated levels. Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain. But certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter. The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy. We think we can be patient if a response is called for we will not hesitate.

So if you look at the progress that we've made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be yes. I do think that that is possible. Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility. Thank you. Thank you. Next we'll go to Gina at the New York Times. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you're thinking about wages at this moment.

And in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday. Now, in real terms, they had been running a little bit below inflation. So real wages were not really increasing. I think with the ECI reading, it becomes close to, maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero. In terms of the real increase. So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It's very important. And it's generally a good thing.

Are we at or close to a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you've for recovering these lost jobs so that now from a risk management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate high. It's kind of a related question. The statement today says you'll keep policy accommodated, and so you hit that 2% inflation target. Our survey show looking for 5% inflation this year, 3.5% next year. It sure seems like you're on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2% target. Thanks. Yeah, so I'm not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say, effect, could you just quickly succinctly say your first question again? Sure, the idea that the tradeoff between inflation and employment that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks or finally these 5 million jobs get at the same time, all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation.",0.0,0.0

Yeah, so this isn't the traditional Phillips curve situation where there's a direct trade over where that's really what we're talking about. The inflation that we're seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It's due to bottlenecks and it's due to shortages and it's due to very strong demand meeting those. So I think it's not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff. But in this situation, we do have a provision in our statement on longer run goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is we take into account the employment and shortfalls and inflation deviations in the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judge consistent with the mandate.

We have to be aware of the risks that were particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year. We see well in next year, we see higher inflation persisting. And we have to be in position to address that risk. Should it become really a threat to create a threat of more persistent longer term relation. And that's what we think our policy is doing now.

And I'm wondering how you would also characterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually. Thank you.

So I'm not going to give you a lot more detail on the what that might be. Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we'll communicate very transparently and openly about that.

Thank you. Yeah, so first of all, it is our job too, and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term. We're accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we're also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control. We don't think it's a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further.

And there's a real time component measured in months, or let's say, really for us what transitory has meant is that if something is transitory, you will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation. So that's why we took a step back from transitory. We said expected to be transitory. First of all, to show uncertainty around that. We've always said that, by the way, in other contexts. We just hadn't done it in the statement. But also to acknowledge, really, that means different things to different people.

Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is look, we understand completely that it's particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes, we understand completely what they're going through and we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn't become a permanent feature of life.

So can you give us some. Examples of things you're looking at specifically to measure full employment will you be looking at prime age employment population ratio for example.

So it's taking into account quite a broad range of things. And of course, employment levels of employment participation are part of that. But in addition, there are other measures of what's going on in the labor market. employment wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is. The level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states. So we look at so many different things and you make an overall judgment. Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that's the goal because we didn't know any, that's what we knew.

And it's clear that there are, with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we're set up to go back to a higher job creation. So that would suggest that you're not at maximum employment. So at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing. But of course, it also has to be a level of employment that's consistent with price stability. And if I could just follow up briefly, you talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be intention and how you would have to balance those two things. Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed's process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that say, come next year, you decide there's a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressure despite ongoing employment shortfalls?

It's appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further. We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived. And Delta stopped, it stopped job creation. It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there's excess demand for goods because their services are not available, people are not traveling.

The overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE. And they have a long-held position, which is not favorable to blind trust. They do not encourage them. They don't think they're effective. They think they're cumbersome and they think they're better ways to get at the things that need to be done. And those are the things that we're actually doing. So I don't know that there are any blind trusts for that reason because they are the regular. Or they say this on their website if you look.

What is the fact that basically your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year and now you are talking about it not coming down to the second or third quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that?

When you're talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it's a whole different thing. And you're talking about a pandemic that's holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don't have a lot of experience with this. So it's very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy. So we have to set policy, though. So that's what we're doing. And, you know, so to look at your question this way, I don't think that we're behind the curve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes.

So you announced that the Fed is going to taper at a rate of starting at $15 billion a month. And that's more than twice the pace of the last taper. So why are you tapering faster this time?

This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people. So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013 where we still had quite a ways to go. I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, little on price stability. So this is quite a different situation and the committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we'd articulated and this was appropriate. And this is faster than what people had expected six months ago. It's earlier and faster and that's because our as I mentioned our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves as it's clarifying itself.

Will you hold the balance sheet steady or will you allow to start passively winding down. And then in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what Fed bond buying actually does for the economy in terms of its economic impact? Have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any any fashion, you know, because I'm sure you know there's often been questions about what is bond buying actually doing to help the economy? In terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mentioned, we haven't gone back to them.

In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so there's a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this, and you can kind of, you can find different people coming out with different views. I would say, most mainstream view would be that you're at the effect of lower bound. So how do you affect longer term rates? There are two ways. One, so you can't lower rates. Let's say you can't lower rates any further hypothetically. So you can give forward guidance. You can say we're going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either a specific period until certain conditions are met. The markets will do the math, and that'll have an effect on longer term borrowing, because even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing. So that's one thing.

So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People that you can service your debt, you have more free cash flow. You know, it's not different from what we do with the short end. So that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was, I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were a pin to the lower bound many, many years ago. So anyway, that's how it's supposed to work. And you know, it's quite hard to be precise about these things because you only have one economy, and you can't run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. But most people thought, most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, which is to say at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do it. We do more, more accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity over time with a leg. So I think that's...",0.0,0.0

So that's a sign of a really strong labor market as opposed to people just running off and quitting. There have also been, there are a significant number of retirements. And we'll just have to see what that means. So toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our record of economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend.
