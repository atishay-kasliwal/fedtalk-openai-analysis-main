We have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high.",0.0,0.003565125041090331

In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. And I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. In-indicators of spending and production have softened. Growth and consumer spending has slowed significantly. In part, reflecting lower, real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part, reflecting higher mortgage rates. And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business-fixed investment also looks to have declined in the second quarter.

Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Employment demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. Overall the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%.

Notwithstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's war on Ukraine has boosted prices for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflation.

Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%.

This process is likely to involve a period of below-trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions. But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer-run.

I'm wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the decision not to go for a full percentage point increase. We saw a ramp up after the May CPI report came in hotter than usual and then obviously the June figure did too. Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting? Thank you. Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude and light of the data in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we've been making. I'd say that we wouldn't hesitate to make an even larger move than we did today if the committee were to conclude that that was appropriate. That was not the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made. You mentioned the June meeting.

Thank you so much for taking our questions Colby Smith with the financial times as the committee considers the policy path forward how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation which might come as a result of the drop in commodity prices against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings in particular and given that potential tension and signs of you know any kind of activity weakening here how is the committees thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need to go?

We're at 225 to 2.5 and that's right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question is how are we thinking about the path forward? So one thing that hasn't changed is that it won't change. That our focus is continuing to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply and order of brain inflation back down. That'll continue to be our overarching focus. We also say that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that will make decisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? We'll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that'll start with economic activity. Are we seeing the slowdown, the slowdown in economic activity that we think we need and there's some evidence that we are at this time? Of course, we'll be looking at labor market conditions and we'll be asking whether we see of the alignment between supply and demand getting better.",0.0,0.0

Our mandate is for headline, of course. It's not for core, but we look at core because core is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward. So we'll be looking at both and we'll be looking at them for those both really for what they're saying about the outlook rather than just simply for what they say. But we'll be asking, do we see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down? So in light of all that data, the question we'll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2% target. And it's also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large and they've come, they've come quickly and it's likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there's probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening in the pipeline. So where are we going with this?

And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the June meeting. So I think the median for the end of this year, the median would have been between three and a quarter and three and a half. And then people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So that's even though that's now six weeks old, I guess. That's the most recent reading. Of course, we'll update that reading at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that's not a decision we're making now. It's one that will make based on the data we see. And we're going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.

Chair Powell, you've said that your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight. Future's market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SCP, but then lower them a few months later next year. Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent? So I'm going to start by pointing out that it's very hard to say with any confidence in normal times. In normal times what the economy is going to be doing in six or twelve months. And so to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond to the sponsor will be. I mean of course we do that in the SCP, but nonetheless you've got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grant.",-0.0048640879335606,0.0

There's significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is an ordinarily it's quite high. So again, I would, the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the committee's done. Since then, inflation has come in higher. Economic activity has come in weaker than expected. But at the same time, I would say that's probably the best estimate of where the committee's thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year, by which I mean somewhere between three and three and a half percent. And that we, the committee, see further rate increases in 2023. As I mentioned, we'll update that, of course, at the September meeting. But that's really the best I can do on that.

So I wouldn't say it was, I think we didn't expect a good reading, but this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don't talk about my own personal estimate of what the terminal rate would be. I do, I will write down that in, it's going to evolve. It's obviously it has evolved over the course, I think for all participants it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation is going to be. By the time of the September meeting we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments who knows. It will be, it will be a lot, it's an eight week intermeeting period so I think we'll see quite a lot of data and we'll make our decision at that meeting based on that data. Gina. Hi, Jarel.

I wonder how you would think about that. So it's hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this. We would look at both and we would be asking ourselves, are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent? That's really the question. And we'll be making, you know, our policy stance will be set at a level ultimately at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent.

Do you share the president's confidence and not being in a recession? And second, how would or would not a recession change policy? Is it a bright line, sir?

And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you're coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021. You're also seeing tighter monetary policy, and you should see some slowing. We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that the supply site can catch up. We also think that there will be in all likelihood some softening and labor market conditions.

So we're going to be, again, we're going to be focused on getting inflation back down. And we, as I've said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can't have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time. We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic where differences between racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back to that. But that's not happening. That's not going to happen without restoring price stability. So that's something we see as something that we simply must do.

It's been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the risks of doing too much. Does that remain the bias? So we're trying to do just the right amount, right? We're not trying to have a recession and we don't think we have to. We think that there's a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market. As I mentioned, along with in all likelihood some softening in labor market conditions. So that is what we're trying to achieve and we continue to think that there's a path to that. We know that the path has clearly narrowed really based on events that are outside of our control and it may narrow further.

Without restoring price stability, you won't be able to, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong, a sustained period, very strong labor market condition. So of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this. But as a fellow under that, given the uncertainty and the sort of paradoxical flow of data you've been getting, if you're going to make a mistake, would you rather make the mistake from doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little? Yeah, we're trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way. We do see that there are two-sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much, and imposing more of a downturn on the economy than was necessary. But the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost.

When that, on a sustained basis, when that starts to really happen, and we don't think that's happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder and the pain will be that much greater. So I really do think that it's important that we address this now and get it done. Thanks, Chair Powell, Neil Irwin from Axios. To build a little bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the GFU reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other?

The unemployment rate at near 50 year low at 3.6%, all of the wage measures that we track are running very strong. So this is a very strong labor market.

How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings? Thank you. So it's an interesting situation. Of course, we've long used PCE because we think it's just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives. And I think that view is pretty widely understood. That said, the public really reads about CPI. And the difference, really, is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does. And so that accounts for a lot of the difference.

And a lot of this might hit in 2023. The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023 when the economy might be weak. How do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to? Well, just talking about demand for a second. As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter. Consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think people widely looked at the first quarter numbers and thought they didn't make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy, not true of the second quarter.

It was called residual seasonality. We don't know the situation. The truth is, we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it moderating? We're not sure. We're going to have to watch the data carefully. There is a great deal of money on people's balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate is very low. The labor market is very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high. So it's the kind of thing where you think that the economy should actually be doing pretty well in the second half of the year.

Nicole, good kind, CNN business. When does the committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market? And how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates? So I think you're already seeing, you've seen in the labor market what you've seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower. Job creation still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you're seeing that. You're seeing some increase in initial claims for an insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We're not sure that that's actually real.

It's probably down a little bit from what it was, for example, in the latter parts of last year. So there's a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance. If you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it's only the beginning of an adjustment.

We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn't moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID and there's evidence that that's the case. But so we're not seeing much in the way of labor supply. Nonetheless, I would say some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment. I think we're going to be looking at inflation as well.

We're just going to do what we think needs to be done. We're going to get our policy rate to a level where we're confident that inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent confident.

I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation when the committee put in place, got forward guidance on tapering asset purchases. I think it was December 2020. There's a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition and it put you a little bit behind. He did not his words but maybe we're kind of late to react to some of that inflation. So could you talk about that decision and have you looked at it in hindsight at all? Thank you. So, yeah, we said that we wouldn't lift off until we had basically achieved our dual mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that the first look at the new framework that we'd rolled out. Plenty of people were saying, it's not credible. They'll never get inflation to 2%.

So we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn't part of the framework. The December 20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. It was just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don't think that is a materially changed the situation. But I have to admit, I don't think I would do that again. I don't think I would do that again. Ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly unexpected way for all of us. And maybe the learning is that leave a little more flexibility than that. But did it matter in the end? I really don't think it did. I'm not sure what would have mattered if we'd been raising rates three months earlier.

So was that part of that? Where did that fit into all those things? So I think we learned there have been multiple tape tantrums, right? So there was the famous one in 2013. There's what happened at the December 18 meeting where markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply.

That was part of it. Again, I don't think that's the real issue of 2020 and 21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy. That was where the big uncertainty was. And, you know, our view was that the supply side issues would get better, that, you know, that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back. Everyone would get vaccinated. Schools would open. Kids would be in school. And labor force participation would jump back up.

But before then, inflation was coming down months by months and we kind of thought we had the story, probably had the story right.
