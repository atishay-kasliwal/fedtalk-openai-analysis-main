2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:30:00,2023-07-26 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Today, we took another step by raising our policy interest rate a quarter percentage point and we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We've covered.",0.0,0.0014088537653819165

Looking ahead, we will continue to take a data dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. I'll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Both in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year. Although activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, job gains averaged 244,000 jobs per month. A pace below that scene earlier in the year, but still a strong pace.",0.0,0.0

There are some continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in May, total PCE prices rose 3.8%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6%. In June, the 12 months change in the consumer price index or CPI came in at 3.0% and the change in the core CPI was 4.8%.",0.0033016617334187,0.0

Nonetheless, the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher cost of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning to inflation to our 2% objective.

We are also continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today's action, we've raised our policy rate by 5 and a quarter percentage points since early last year. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate, sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with...",0.0,0.0

Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.

Thank you. We haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. It's not something we've looked at. We're going to be going meeting by meeting and as we go into each meeting, we're going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven't made any decisions about any future meetings including the pace at which we consider hiking. But we're going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate.

And the June CPI report, of course, was welcome, but it's only one report, one month's data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as it will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don't know that and we're just going to need to see more data. So what are we going to be looking at? Really it will be the broader, the whole broader picture. And starting with, we're looking for moderate growth, right? We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including in particular in the labor market. We'll be looking at inflation and we'll be asking ourselves, does this whole collection of data, as do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?

I think we have an ECI report coming later this week, which is employment compensation index and lots of data on economic activity.

I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted.

And I'll close by saying we've raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022. Monetary policy we believe is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there.

And it really, we did have the one good reading and of course we've welcomed that but it's just one reading as everybody knows and you know we've seen this before in the data, many forecasts call for rights for inflation to remain low but we just don't know that until we see the data so we'll be focusing on that. Gina. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Obviously you upgraded the language around growth in the statement today. You know, we've seen the Barbie movie numbers, we've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this summer, it seems like the American consumers in pretty good shape and it does seem like growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.

Just how are you thinking about that sort of trajectory? Yeah, so I would say it this way. The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy. Overall, that's good thing. It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that. That will support you get activity going forward. But you're right, though, at the margin, stronger growth could lead over time to higher inflation and that would require an appropriate response from monetary policy. So we'll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time. Neil. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil, everyone from Axios.

Why not take another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see? So if you go back to what we're trying to do here, we're trying to achieve a stance of policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2%. At the last meeting we wrote down our individual estimates of what that would take and the meeting of that was an additional two rate hikes. So I would say we looked at the intermeeting data and as I mentioned broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent but broadly consistent with expectations and as a result we went ahead and took another step.

Chair Powell markets widely believed the median FOMC participants inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter of this year will be too high, given auto as a shelter. Net by September that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points. Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here? Or do you need to see below trend growth and to accelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you've done enough? So it's hard to pick the pieces apart and say how much of this and how much of that. We'll be looking at everything.

It's the totality of the data, I think, but with a particular focus on making progress on inflation. If I could follow up last month, you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions. Would another CPI report, like the one we just had in June, allow you to at least maintain that slower pace and defer until the fall any decision on whether you need that second rate hike? So I'm just going to tell you again, what we're going to do in September, we're going to look at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data, and that's what we're going to look at, and we're going to make that decision then. And that decision could mean another hike in September or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level.

If we don't, then we'll have the option of maintaining policy at that level. But it's really dependent so much on the data, and we just don't have it yet. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruggiever, associated press. So consumer confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of the declines and headline inflation. You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long time. How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3%, and with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate? So I guess I'd say it this way. First, it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much because that's really what the public experiences. And I would say that having headline inflation moved down that much, almost creates a stable strength and the bulls.",0.0,0.0

So you are really sorry, well what your question was. Well, I mean you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard that is for people. So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three? So I guess I would put it this way. We, I'd say it this way. It's really a question of how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too little. And you know, we, I would say that, you know, we're coming to a place where, where there really are risks on both sides. It's hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not. But as our, as our stance has become more restrictive, and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk. But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far.

So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that's what we think is signaling where headline is going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated. There's reason to think it can come down now, but it's still quite elevated. And so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we're going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restricted levels for some time. And we need to be prepared to raise further if we think that's appropriate. Well, and then, if inflation were to just a quick follow, if it stays at three or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation people are talking about the potential difficulty of the last so-called last mile of inflation?

So that's a real blessing and that we've been able to achieve some disinflation. And we don't seek to it. It's not that we're aiming to raise unemployment, but I would just say the historical record. We have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening and labor market conditions. And so that is still the likely outcome here. And we hope that that's as live as possible. We have to be honest that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done.

And that's the thing we really need to avoid and will avoid. At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation lately to the downside. So I'm wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions? Do you think you might need to do more? Because I'm curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now, as the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation. People talk about base effects and higher energy costs. And now we have some large labor settlements. Or is the economy disinflating? And you're just able to go back to the old Fed policy of opportunistic disinflation. So just.",0.0,0.0

We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures. We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market, and all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. Now, what we see is we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together, and we're seeing evidence of those things now. But I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down, sustainably toward our 2% target, and we're prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate.

We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finally judged decisions.

It's really going to depend on what the data tell us. That's the best we can do. So we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency let's say. It could be you know longer intervals in between as well.

The first thing to say is we're determined to bring inflation down to 2% over time and we will use our tools to do that. No one should doubt that. I would look at it this way though. The real federal funds rate is now in a meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal federal funds rate, subtract a mainstream estimate of near term inflation expectations. You get a real federal funds rate that is well above most estimates of the longer term neutral rate. So I would say monetary policy is restrictive more so after today's decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. We'll keep monetary policy restrictive until we think it's not appropriate to do so. So that's how I think about it. I mean, if I sum it up, I would say we've come a long way.

So I guess the sluice will come out early next week, and I would just say it's broadly in consistent with what you would expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter. You've got weak demand. And it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it's really hard to tease out whether how much of that is from this source or that source.

Could you break down the reasons why inflation is fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes, or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year? Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we've always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive monetary policy, which would help return the balance between supply.",0.0,0.0019094440664574426

So to go break it down a little further, of course, headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to reversal of the effects from the war in Ukraine. And that's a good thing. And the public experience is that, as I mentioned earlier. For core inflation, I'd say there also, there has been a role for both factors, both that I mentioned. Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role, as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal of spending back into services and away from goods. And St. Take Autos is an example of the combination of an increase in sales and inventories. Well, vehicle inflation has decelerated points to a substantial role for supply. But there's also a role for demand as, you know, the rate loans and things like that are more expensive. So they're both working there.",0.0,0.0

Where really we think that's where the labor market will come in as a very important factor. So we think both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role. And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes? Or is there my more even split there too? I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we're sort of reaping now the benefits of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things. We're seeing that with goods in particular. We've just supply chains and shortages moving and we're seeing.

So the beige book, it said input cost pressures remain elevated for services firms, but ease notably for manufacturing sectors. That in indication that there's a wage inflation pressure and how do you target and pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into recession. I think as it relates to goods, it's really an indication that that supply chains and shortages are easing. And so what was the first part of it? So wage inflation, how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession? I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions and that's what we're seeing. So wages have actually been gradually moving down.

And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that you can look at the quits rate normalizing. You can look at job openings coming down. You can look at just job creation in the establishment survey. It's still at a high level, but it was really an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last report. So I think we see that. And it's happening in a gradual pace. So that's actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy. People are getting hired. Many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money, and that's really what's driving the economy. But that it's gradually slowing. It's gradually cooling.

And when people are writing down rate cuts next year, you know, it's, it's just as a sense that inflation is coming down and we're comfortable that it's coming down and it's time to start cutting rates. I think, but I mean, it's, there's a lot of uncertainty between what, what happens, you know, when the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year, let alone the year after that. So it's, it's hard to say exactly what, what happens there, what, what's motivating people. So if it's sort of, sort of stubbornly and maybe the high-tos, you wouldn't necessarily cut rates. I'm not, I'm not saying that at all. I'm not giving you any numerical guidance around that. I'm saying we would, we'd be comfortable cutting rates when we're comfortable cutting rates.

A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the Fed is gonna be able to engineer a soft landing and they've reduced their forecast for recession. And I'm wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of recession being likely. And if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident that you can achieve a soft landing. So one, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot in my base cases that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we've seen in some past, in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.

So it's a long way from a short and we have a lot left to go to see that happen. So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession. So I just want to note that our staff produces its own forecast, which is independent of the forecast that we as FOMC participants produce. Having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecast is really a strength of our process.

And that's a really good thing. I would just also say the historical records suggest that there's very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions. And consistent with having a soft landing, you would have some softening in labor market conditions. And that's still likely as we go forward with this process. But it's a good thing today that we haven't really seen that. We've seen softening through either not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment.

You and other federal officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2% that as long as you see continued progress.

So in effect, if you look at our forecasts, we, the median participant and again, these are forecasting out here, so take them with a grain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because, you know, the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now. So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don't need to be at a restrictive level anymore. We can, you know, we can move back to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, you know, we would, of course, would be very careful about that. We'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be, but that's the way I would think about it is you'd start, you'd stop raising long before you, you got to 2% inflation and you'd start cutting before you got to 2% inflation too because we...",0.0,0.0

They may be tightening a little bit more, probably, are than other banks. The saluce has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening.

And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May? I just don't think we know that. I think we're looking at the current data in GDP and we're seeing strong spending, we're seeing a strong economy.

I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we've been seeing. Well, wages in excess of inflation means real wages are positive. Again, that's a great thing. Of course, we want that. We want people to have real wages, but we want wages to be going up at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. As I mentioned, nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that's what we want to see. We expect to see more of that. That's just more of what's consistent over a longer period of time. We don't really think that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak, but I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.

This goes sort of to the balance and risks question, but you mentioned at the start how you're keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there. I'm curious what the Fed's explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit. The labor market start to drive that sentiment back down. What's the message there of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them? Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control. And we think the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most important thing we can do now and we're determined to do that.

Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was actually going to be? Well, I mean, you could, was there doubt?
