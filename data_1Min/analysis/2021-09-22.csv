At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our current pace of asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress on vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4% pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half.

Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of the year, but flattened out in July and August as spending softened in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. Additionally, in some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where the worldwide shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production. Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised somewhat lower since our June summary of economic projections, but participants still foresee rapid growth. Less with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong.",0.0,0.0

In August, however, job gains slowed markedly with the slowdown concentrated insectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate was 5.2% in August, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project a labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8% at the end of this year, and 3.5%.",-0.0011612404265318,0.0

The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating. As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants' inflation projections for this year. While these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal.",0.0,0.0

As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation.

The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases, resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery. Continued progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. Our asset purchases have been a critical tool. They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic, and since then have helped foster a commonative financial conditions to support the economy.

If progress continues broadly as expected, the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted. We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the committee's guidance. While no decisions were made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate. Even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions. The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate lift-off, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.

Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled by the end of next year. As a result the median projection for the appropriate level of the Federal Funds Rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022. Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy firming that would leave the level of the Federal Funds Rate below estimates of its longer run level through 2024. Of course these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. War important than any forecast is the fact that policy will remain accommodative until we have achieved our maximum employment and price stability goals.,0.0009551215406567999,0.0

And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress, substantial further progress. So that part of the test is achieved in my view and in the view of many others. So the question is really on the maximum employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that since last December when we articulated the test and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance for example between the unemployment rate, unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate, 50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial for their progress. Many on the committee feel that the substantial for their progress test for employment has been met. And I just feel that it's close. They want to see a little...",0.0,0.0

I guess my own view would be that the test, the substantial for their progress test for employment is all but met. And so once we've met those two tests, once the committee decides that they've met and that could come as soon as the next meeting, that's the purpose of that language is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting. The committee will consider that test and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider. Thanks Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. So looking at the steps, we are now basically four years of inflation above target and policy never gets to the long run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives. One, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year. And second, from the perspective of the average household that's now",0.0,0.0021699406121516414

Sure, so as you can see the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the out years. And that's really I think a reflection of and they've moved up significantly for this year. And that's I think a reflection of the fact that the the bottlenecks and shortages that are being that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation is going to be higher this year and a number that there were I guess the inflation rates for for next year and 2023 were also marked up. But just by a couple of tents.

These are very, very, I don't think that the, that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tents of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to, we want to foster a strong labor market and we want to foster inflation averaging 2% over time. And I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. In terms of the framework, I see this is very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2%. We want, we're, we're, that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework. And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2%.

And I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been for those that want to move a bit more quickly. Is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases? At a time when we have supply constraints, thank you. So let me say that there's very broad support on the committee for this plan, both us to the timing and us to the pace of the taper. So this was an anonymous vote today, and I'd say quite, quite broad support for this approach.

They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets. And as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand as they will do. And now we're in a situation where they still have a use, but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their use is usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing.

Chair Powell, you have said the test for a lift off is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate lift off and not just a taper may be closer at hand. Does the committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for lift off that you've articulated, or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? Well, so again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months and everyone's figuring. So you're going to be well away from satisfying the lift off test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the lift off test, though, you know, it is.",0.0,0.002624645503613602

And while we have interesting signs that in many ways, the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market. And we think that those imbalances will sort themselves out. Inflation at 2% and on track to achieve moderately higher inflation over 2%. That really depends on the path of inflation. Inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reached lift-off. So I just think if you look at what people are writing down for year and 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low on employment rates. And that's only one indicator.

And in 2019, I froze that meaning. I, they're no, I'm holding all the securities, my wife and I, to maturity. And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because as you, as you know, the law was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities.

And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it's quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up and that cuts a quite a tight, tight labor market.

No one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. That's something we take very, very seriously.

Well, let me say one thing. You're looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off. And those conditions can change over time. So you're not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point, really, we actually have a paragraph in our framework and something like this has been there for a long time. It's I think it's paragraph six.

So we used to call that the balanced approach paragraph because it had those words. So it's a very difficult situation for any central bank to be pardon me, to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension. And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two how long will it take and how big are the gaps and that kind of thing. We don't really think we're in that sort of in that situation, I'd say in a short term way, but we think we do expect that this is sort of a because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that you're seeing this temporarily.

And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists, which are pretty much in line with the FOMC members, and lay people's expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey. How much weight do you put on lay people's expectations? And what do you think accounts for that divide? So within, let's just take the household surveys generally. The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed.

It doesn't have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in and you measure the change. So you should be, and also you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing. So you can look at all of that. And you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up. Many of the, many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in say 2013, which was before the really, the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in 14 and 15 around then.

We can certainly speed up or slow down the tape if we, if it becomes appropriate, though, absolutely. In fact, back in 13, when we tapered, we always said we weren't on a preset course. I think this will be a shorter period. The economy is much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013. So, it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen. It's a very gradual taper.
