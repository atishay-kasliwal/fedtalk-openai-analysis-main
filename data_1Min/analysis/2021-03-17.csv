Looking back, it was clear that addressing a fast-moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of healthcare providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice. The danger to the U.S. economy was also clear. Congress provided by far the fastest and largest response to any post-war economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, healthcare providers, and state and local governments. Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidly deployed our full range of tools to provide relief and stability to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible and to limit lasting damage to the economy. We are strongly committed to achieving.",0.0,0.0015693818660456754

The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action, from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the country. More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions. And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent. At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes. Today, the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizeable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver.",0.0,0.0

The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus, and the measures undertaken to control its spread. Since January, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year. In the meantime, continued observance of social distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain. Following the moderation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak.

The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions, which have provided essential support to households, businesses and communities. The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up notably since our December summary of economic projections.

The unemployment rate remains elevated at 6.2% in February. This figure understates the short fall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline. The median projection is 4.5% at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5% by the end of 2023.

Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen. Particularly if supply belt bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term. However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation.

That still seems like some progress there. 4.5% unemployment. Is it time to start.

That's what we're going to want to see. Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see, we'll be carefully looking ahead. We also understand that we will want to provide as much advanced notice of any potential taper as possible. So when we see that we're on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we're on track to perhaps achieve substantial for their progress, then we'll say so. And we'll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper. If I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots, why wouldn't that suggest a weakening of the commitment here?

And as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecast to move up. It's probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for a lift off. Nonetheless, the bulk of the committee, the largest part by far of the committee, doesn't show a rate increase during this period. And again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.

You know, there's been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this month, which I'm happy to hear an update if you have one, but just sort of more broadly, do you think long term that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large? And if so, do you think that changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR are the way to deal with that problem? Victoria, we'll have something to announce on that in coming days. And I'm not going to expound upon your questions. Why don't you ask another question if you'd like to because that one, I'm just going to say that we're something in coming days. Sure. Okay.

You're also looking at labor force participation and things like that. So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you're projecting the unemployment rate to the summary of economic projections? Well, let me say, as we say in our statement, our longer-run goals in monetary policy strategy, we look to a range of indicators on labor market. We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of labor market outcomes that's in the SEP. We look at a very broad range. You hear us talk all the time about participation, about employment to population, which is the combination of the two, about different measures of unemployment.

Obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that's a very insufficient statistic. So it doesn't include a lot of other things that we do look at. And I wouldn't want to say that we're looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP. But at time, from time to time, we do look at adding different things. But I would just say the SEP is a summary. It's one device. It's not going to include all of the things that we look at. I think you know the things that we look at, which we talk about them all the time. So we're not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now.

Labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment.

And inflation is on track to run moderately above 2% for some time. The first two of those three are very much database. The third does have a little bit of an element of expectations in it.

Part of that just is talking about inflation is one thing. Actually having inflation run above 2% is the real thing. So we've over the years we've talked about 2% inflation as a global we haven't achieved it. So I would say we'd like to perform. That's what we'd really like to do.

So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning.

Investment in plan and equipment. Investment in software. It takes a lot of investment to support a more productive economy and raise living standards. And that hasn't been the principal focus with these measures, our measures certainly. We don't have those tools, but what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to support people as the economy returns to normal.

How much debate and how can you characterize that conversation? Has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled? Well, you know, it all depends. We've set out very clear criteria for lift off, right? Where we've said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment. And that doesn't just mean unemployment. It means a much broader set of criteria. We want inflation at 2% and not on a transitory basis. And we want inflation on track to be moderately to run moderately above 2% for something. Those are the three conditions. Everybody on the committee agrees to that, right?

In terms of households and businesses, households entered the crisis in very good shape by historical standards. Leveraging the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the financial crisis. Now there was some negative effects on that.

And they've been quiet since the spring, and we shut down our facilities and all that. But we don't feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that those some aspects of the short-term funding markets and more broadly non-bank financial or intermediation didn't hold up so well under great stress, under tremendous stress.

If you get to 3.5% unemployment, but inflation is only at 2.1%, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there or roughly zero going forward from there?

Participation was high, wages were moving up, it was a very healthy thing, and we didn't see price inflation move up. There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. But what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.

And as the data come in and the economy performs will, of course, adjust. Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is.

Are they getting better or are they getting worse? We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers that came out yesterday. And what do you expect them to do to prices in just in the short run? I, you know, say I think it I think it's been possible to say frankly with any confidence, but I would expect it's very possible. Let's put it that way that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time. And you'll probably see that over a period of time because, you know, really the the strong data are ahead of us. You know, you're right now that the checks are going out just just now. And that'll that'll add to spending. COVID cases are coming down. Vaccination is moving.",0.0,0.0

And that's when you'll really know where the bottlenecks are. But you can see, though, that these are not permanent. It's not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things. The market will clear. It just may take some time. And some of the answer to that may be price. In many cases, it won't be price. You'll see that people are reluctant to raise prices. You know, it's a little bit of the story about, you know, the wage, the wage Phillips curve does show that, as unemployment goes down, wages move up. But companies choose not to try to pass that price increase along to their customers. So you'll see a lot of that here, too, I think. Anyway, we'll see. But that's my basic sense. Thank you very much. Thank you.",0.0,0.0
