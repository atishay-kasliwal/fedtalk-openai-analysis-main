2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:30:00,2022-01-26 18:31:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December bringing them to an end in early March. As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy. Fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial position.",0.0,0.0013961565965561677

The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Amichron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter. High frequency indicators point to reduced spending in COVID-sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants. And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines or caregiving needs. Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Amichron variant has not been as virulent as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly. If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a return to strong growth. That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain, and we have not lost sight of the fact that for many afflicted individuals and families,",0.0,0.0

The labor market has made remarkable progress, and by many measures is very strong. Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three months. Over the past year payroll employment has arisen by 6.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand remains historically strong.

In addition, some who would otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. The current wave of the virus may well prolong these effects. Over time, there are good reasons to expect some further improvements in participation and employment. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term.

Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability. We are committed to our price stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.",0.0,0.0

The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As I noted, the committee left the target range for the Federal Funds Raid unchanged and reaffirmed our plan announced in December to end asset purchases in early March. In light of the remarkable progress we've seen in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2% longer run goal, the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support. That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases in WAG we expected will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Raid. Of course the economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in unexpected ways.

With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals. To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, today the committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions. These high-level principles clarify that the Federal Funds Rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary policy, and that reducing our balance sheet will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun. Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities roll off our balance sheet. Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample reserves operating framework. And in the longer run, we envision holding primarily treasury securities.",0.0,0.0

We'll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily in transparency, transparently. So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically the economy is now much stronger. The labor market is far stronger. The situation is running well over 2% target, much higher than it was at that time. These differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven't made any decisions. Thank you.

Do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages? Sorry, just getting both parts of your question written down. So I would say, and this view is widely held in the committee that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in a sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability. And that is my personal view. And again, very broad support on the committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.

In the particular situation we're in now, it may well increase the level of maximum of employment that's consistent with stable prices may increase. And we hope that it will as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises. And the policy path that we're broadly contemplating would be supportive of that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are many millions of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can raise rates and move to less accommodative and even tight financial conditions without hurting the labor market. I think there's quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market. This is by so many measures, a historically tight labor market. Over the centuries levels of job openings, of quits, wages are moving up at the highest pace they have.",0.0,0.0

And all of those readings are at levels really that we haven't seen in a long time, and in some cases, ever. So this is a very, very strong labor market. And my strong sense is that we can move rates up without having to severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation. We hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come at the timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of growth this year, not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing and pace of that.",-0.000692176855403,0.0

Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timmeros at the Wall Street Journal. I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. If stay much on the balance sheet today, calls for significantly reducing your holdings. What does that mean? And then apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And finally, how much disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you.",0.0,0.0

So we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a team up of the issues at this meeting. We've gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level, and those are meant to guide the actual decisions we'll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you're asking. And I expect that this process will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings. I can't tell you how many, I can't tell you how long it will take. But, and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we'll provide additional information. So I did, the last cycle when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.

It has a shorter duration than the last time, and the economy is much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So, and I think that leads you to, and I've said this, being willing to move sooner than we did in the last time, and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it's really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be. But I would point you to principle number one, which is the committee views changes in the target rate for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. So, we do want the federal funds rate. We want to operationalize that, and we want the balance sheet to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments.

For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every quarter percentage point increase in your benchmark rate? So, again, we think of the balance sheet as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it's the federal funds rate. For there are rules of thumbs, I'm reluctant to land on one of them that equate this, and that there's also an element of uncertainty around the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and hence economic conditions. Balance sheet is still a relatively new thing for the markets and for us, so we're less certain about that.

And you also know that we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what we're always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough of a change in financial conditions that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goal? So that's how we're looking at that. And I don't want to comment on today's financial conditions broadly, but we're not looking at any one market or so. So that's how we're thinking.

We have we have our eyes on on the risks particularly around the world but we do expect some softening in the economy from Amichron but we think that that should be temporary and we think that the underlines of the country should you know should should show through further quickly after that.

Given development since then, do you still think that's a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?

So you'll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one and it involves inevitably surprises. And so during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times. Now, we didn't intend to do that. It just, events required us to do so. So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says, we're free to do this at any time. And it doesn't mean we're going to. But if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we're not going to stick with something that isn't working. That's all that saying.

And on and on like that, I mean, those are all the things that try to describe how we will proceed. But maybe at a higher level to try to get at your question, you know, asset purchases were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function as they were right after the in the critical phase of the global financial crisis. And then after they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the economy no longer needs this highly accommodative policy that we put in place.

Now, the balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be. We've identified the end state as amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently, effectively, in the ample reserve regime. So there's a substantial amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done. That's going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable.

And there really was no obvious imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion it could have gone on for years. We're not hit by the pandemic. So we'd love to find a way to get back to that.

One, the COVID is not over and COVID can continue to evolve. And it's just we have to accept that it's not over and the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be that's sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint. Another point to, you know, another risk is just further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that's their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns. It's likely to and that may play into, may play into more problems in supply chains. In addition, there's what's going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.",0.0,0.008059206792435722

And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deserteration. Like how do we get from here, 7% CPI to where you expect to be at the end of the year? So I'd say, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same, but probably slightly worse. I'd be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation.

So what do we think about that? Well I think we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings each of us individually and I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further our policy will have to address that. If it deteriorates meaningfully further either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned though I think it's part of this will be that we're us the Fed moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then over time to a policy that's not accommodative in time.

Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years, that impulse will be less, in fact, will be negative this year. And so that's another thing. The other one is we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And the ports will be cleared up and there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now what we're learning is it's just taking much longer. So I think longer than expected. And that I think does raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think we'll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the spring last year, but really what's the question is going to be what is inflation running at.

If you look back to where we were in 2015, 2016, 2018, when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2%, even below 2%. Unemployment was not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was in the 2% to 3% range. Right now we have inflation running substantially above 2%, and more persistently than we would like.

If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you're seeing, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed, you're seeing a very, very tight labor market. Now we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It's a percentage point and a half lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a percentage point of that is retirements. Some part of those retirements are related to COVID rather than just regular retirements. So we think there is a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force.

I don't I'm not aware of you know inflation literally falling more on on different uh social economic groups. It's that's not the point. The point is some people are just really in uh in in prone to suffer more. I mean for people who are economically well off inflation isn't good. It's bad.

What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly progress. Because we're not making much progress. If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorters and inventories in some industries moving up. But overall, we're not making progress.

I'd like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is, are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2%, do you want to go below 2%, so that on average you get a 2% inflation rate? And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side? So no, there's nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2%, so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the answer to that is no. What we're trying to do is keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2%, that's always the ultimate goal. And we do that in the service of having inflation.",0.0,0.0

I mean, if inflation doesn't average 2% over time, then it's not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2%. So that's the way we think about that. You know, what was the last part of your question? I was asking if you're protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there's some sort of circuit breaker there. Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market, and you have growth this year at a forecast to be well above, well above potential. I mean, people are forecasting growth.

So monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent and a situation where the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one. But I don't really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation.

If I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent and making decisions rather than the state dependency you've been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so. The dependency was particularly around the thought that if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation, actual inflation before we tightened. And so that was a very state dependent thought because for a long time we'd been tightening on the expectation of high inflation which never appeared. And that was the case for a number of years.

And we responded.
