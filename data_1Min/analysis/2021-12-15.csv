At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the criteria specified in the committee's forward guidance for interest rates. In addition, in light of the strength thing labor market and elevated inflation pressures, we decided to speed up the reductions in our asset purchases. As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy. Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy.",0.0,0.0009089630246827089

The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron variant, pose risks to the outlook.

The recent improvements in labor market conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor force participation showed a welcome rise in November, but remains subdued, in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements. In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of factors related to the pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus. At the same time, employers are having difficulties, filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years.

Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next. Supply and demand and balances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term. These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2% longer run goal and will likely continue to do so well into next year.

Wages have also risen briskly, but thus far wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation. We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put to upward pressure on inflation. Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline to levels closer to our 2% longer run goal by the end of next year. The median inflation projection of FOMC participants falls from 5.3% this year to 2.6% next year. This trajectory is notably higher than projected in September.

In support of these goals, the committee reaffirmed the 0-24% target range for the federal funds rate. We also updated our assessment of the progress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our forward guidance for the federal funds rate.

Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. At today's meeting, the committee also decided to double the pace of reductions in its asset purchases. Beginning in mid-January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by mid-March.

We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market, the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support. In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. We remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And even after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery and employment and achieve our price stability goal. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate to keep rates near zero until label market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum employment, and there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year. In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like? When will you know that that threshold has been met and how will that be communicated? Thank you. So maximum employment, if you look at our statement of longer run goals in monetary policy strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force and various parts of the labor force.

The committee will make a judgment that we have achieved, labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment. When it makes that, it is admittedly a judgment call because it's a range of factors. Unlike inflation where we have one number that sort of dominates, it's a broad range of things. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see that in, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned. Great, thank you.

Won't the impact of today's changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem? Aren't you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in March that you will start to have any impact on the inflation problem? So on the first part of your question, which is why not stop purchasing now, I would just say this, we've learned that we're in dealing with balance sheet issues. We've learned that it's best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it and we thought that this was a doubling of the speed. We're basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper and we thought that was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it and that's what will happen.

And my own sense is that they get into if financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months, shorter than that rather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we're going to do, the markets move immediately to that. If financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecast that we made, and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting. But financial conditions don't wait to change until things actually happen. They change on the expectation of things happening. So I don't think it's a question of having to wait.

The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation. Since we're two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then what we would stop the taper potentially sooner. That's not something I expect to happen, but I do not think it would be appropriate. And we don't find ourselves in a situation where we might have to raise rates while we're still purchasing assets.

Is that an approach you support now or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different? Thank you. So we haven't made any decision of that nature and so no I wouldn't say that's our position at all. We really haven't taken a position on that. I will say that we did talk today. We had our first discussion about the balance sheet for example and we went through the way the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet last time and I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They thought that it was informative but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time and that those the differences that we that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet and the same thing would be true about raising.,0.0,0.0

I was here at the Fed when we lifted off the last time, and the economy is so much stronger now, it's so much closer to full employment. Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential. There wouldn't be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I will make this decision coming meetings, and it's not a decision that the committee has really focused on yet. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. Thank you, Nick Timmeros at the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in March, you answered a question about maximum employment like this.

Right. So the, you know, the thing is we're not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on that was the sense was that that's where we were headed. The post-pandemic labor market and the economy in general will be different.

We've begun to see some improvement. We were certainly welcome the two-tenths improvement that we got in the November report.

So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect. It doesn't, you know, we'll have an economic effect. The delta had an effective slowing down hiring.

So, you know, the new framework was basically designed as I understand it so that there was a de-emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment. And basically you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation. And that's how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment. So, I'm wondering, you know, you've talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment. But from what I understand, that's still basically the way that you know that you're there is inflation. So, is that understanding correct? And how are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that's caused by these supply chain disruptions that might also be. You know, inflation and wages.",0.0,0.0

So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework. This was, it really was a completely different thing. It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly and in which there were these supply side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve. So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate sensitive and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars but it can't because they don't have semiconductors. So that was a very different kind of inflation. This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all. It's nothing to do with our framework and the way we've approached it is really nothing to do with our framework. But come to maximum employment which is really your question.",0.0,0.006945348786734359
2021-12-15 18:30:00,2021-12-15 19:01:00,2021-12-15 19:02:00," So I think you look at prices in quantities. If you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices in quantities. And the main price you look at is wages. It's one of the things you look at. And so I mentioned a number of the things. You could get to 20 if you wanted to easily. But labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of, you know, prime age labor force participation in particular, gets a lot of focus. The Jolt's data get a lot of focus. And wages, that's really one of the great signals. The quits rate is another one. The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like they can get a better job. And there's, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that going on, suggesting again that you've got a very tight labor market. So on wages, that's the price indicator we look at to tell us along with all the other data, whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum employment.",0.0,0.0

So how do we think about that? If we think we can make labor participation might move up, if we let's say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years? Or when inflation is running way above target? Probably not. So you have to make an assessment that what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time? Is one way to think about it? Just to kind of follow up on that for a second. If you do raise interest rates next year, and you're not certain whether you're at maximum employment, are you all going to point when you raise interest rates? Are you going to point to ways in which the labor market could still improve? Yes. I mean, absolutely. I think, well, whether or not we say, whether or not we...",-0.0016462352548694001,0.0

We would all be open and I think expect over time that the level of maximum employment that's consistent with price stability would increase further over time, for example, through increasing participation. So we would certainly, we would not in any way want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better. But again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We've got to make that assessment in real time. Thank you. We'll go to Olivia from Bloomberg. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. And thank you for taking our questions. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force participation.

If you think about it, you know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to vacancies is at all time highs, quits that the wages, all those things are even hotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know, that's really why is it low? It's the question. There are a bunch of answers and all of them probably have some validity. Part of it will be that people, for certain people, they don't want to go back in the labor force because either they're medically vulnerable or they're not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That's one thing. The lack of availability of childcare for caretakers is certainly part of it, not just for children, but for older people.

The equity they have in their home might have doubled and they might make reach the same conclusion. So there, and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings that, because they couldn't spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers. So for all of those reasons and it's hard to know exactly the part each of them plays, we have a situation where we've had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as many as expected. And people, in effect, a good part of it is voluntary. You know, people, and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that's, that's, that's their, certainly their choice.

That's what the evidence would say. So it's a range of things. It isn't that the economy lacks stimulus. Usually in every other expansion, it's that there aren't enough jobs and people can't find jobs. And we're stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That's not the problem here. The problem is a supply side problem, which what it would take to work it out. I think it's going to be time. And number one thing it would really be to have the pandemic get under control. That's what everyone would really like to see. What does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that we'd really like to see.

Does that make you think we're going to end up at a lower rate overall? Well, there's a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But so one would expect over time that labor forced participation would would move down because in aging population the older people are the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that that that that trend would be lower and that over time participation would would move down. The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020 and indeed for the for the year or so before that is a good one.

There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. Higher participation is one of them, and we'd love to get back there. But again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand, and also to control inflation. I mean, really, it might be one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation. Because to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it's going to take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we've been having over the last 40 years.

The consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation in the virus or something else. Thank you. We see consumer expenses very strong in this quarter.

In other words, is it a question of when, not if you raise interest rates and does it suggest that maybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you're behind the curve? So actually, I'm looking at the SEP here and the median forecasts for a core and headline inflation did move up by four tenths each. So that's a significant, you know, in an SEP that's a pretty significant move up. You know, it's based on both of those things I suppose.

Households are in very strong financial shape. Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low. But nonetheless, it's something we're watching.

You know, as I mentioned, the SCP meetings are for 4% growth next year, 3.5% unemployment at the end of the year, and the headline inflation of 2.6% next year, core 2.7%.

No one had seen what it would look like, really looked like for an extended period for decades. And we didn't know what the inflation or implications were.

So, in a way, it's not surprising that there's a lot of demand for US sovereigns in a risk-free world where there's...",0.0,0.0

I also think there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is. I don't know about that. But I would just say that we write down our own estimates of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest. Those are highly uncertain. And we'll make policy based on what we're seeing in the economy rather than based on what a model might say the neutral rate is. And we all have the experience of the last cycle where we all through that cycle were trying to estimate what the neutral rate wasn't it turned out. I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens. We run a cutting rate three times after raising them to 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 So I'm not troubled by where the long bond is. I see that it's low.

We'll go to Greg Robb. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, I was wondering if I was wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about something I've heard that's been discussed that you know your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy had something to do with the timing of your reenomination by the president. Thank you. Sure, I'd be happy to talk about that. So as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the Labor Market report two days after the meeting and then one week after that, I think on the 12th of November we got the CPI reading. It was really the CPI reading and concert with those two and I just came to the view.",0.0,0.0

That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision on re-nominating me. So honestly, it had nothing to do with that at all. And I just thought, this is what we got to do. My colleagues were out talking about the faster taper. And that doesn't happen by accident. They were out talking about a fast-paced day before the President made his decision. So it's a decision that effectively was more than in train and to the point where people were talking about it publicly. So that's what happened. And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. We're always going to just do what we think is the right thing. And I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve. Just a quick follow-up. I guess that some people saying that it was the stimulus in March that that was sort of over.",0.0,0.0
