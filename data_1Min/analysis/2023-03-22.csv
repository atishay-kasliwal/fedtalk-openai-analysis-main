2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:40:00," Good afternoon. Before discussing today's meeting, let me briefly address recent developments in the banking sector. In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at a small number of banks have emerged. History has shown that isolated banking problems, if left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of households and businesses. That is why, in response to these events, the Federal Reserve, working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system. These actions demonstrate that all depositors' savings and the banking system are safe. With the support of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par. This program, along with our longstanding discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is available. Our banking system is sound and resilient with strong capital and liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our tools as needed to keep it safe and sound. In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons from this episode and to work to prevent episodes from events like this from happening again. Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy. Inflation remains too high and the labor market continues to be very tight. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The US economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year. In contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside. Yet the labor market remains extremely tight. Job gains have picked up in recent months with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months. The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent. The labor force participation rate has edged up in recent months and wage growth has shown some signs of easing. However, with job vacancy still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 4.6 percent at the end of next year. Conflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE, excluding those core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent. In February, the 12 month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent and the change in the core CPI was 5.5 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025. The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 4 and 3 quarters to 5 percent, and we are continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation. We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy affirming may be appropriate. We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment. In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1% at the end of this year, 4.3% at the end of 2024, and 3.1% at the end of 2025. These are little changed from our December projections reflecting offsetting factors. These projections are not a committee decision or plan. If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our meeting decisions, meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How confident is the committee that the recent stress that we've seen and you've alluded to is contained at this point and that deposit flight among mid-size lenders in particular has ceased? Thanks. I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it's resilient. It's got strong capital and liquidity. We took powerful actions with Treasury and the FDIC which demonstrate that all depositors savings are safe and that the banking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week. And the last thing I'll say is that we've undertaken a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation. Okay. Just a quick follow up. I mean given all of the stress and the uncertainty that you've also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a pause considered for this meeting? So we considered, we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting and you see the decision that we made which I'll say a couple things about. First it was supported by a very strong consensus and I'll be happy to explain why and really it is that the...",-0.0009251850370074,0.004259157187954073
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:40:00,2023-03-22 18:50:00," the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and really before the recent events we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes. In fact as of a couple of weeks ago it looked like we'd need to raise rates over the course of the year more than we'd expected at the time of the SEP in December. It's time to December meeting. We are committed to restoring price stability and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so that we'll bring inflation down to 2% over time. It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words. So we also assess as I mentioned that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening and credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby way on demand on the labor market and on inflation. Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening. In principle as a matter of fact you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that of course it's not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever. So our decision was to move ahead with a 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance as I mentioned from ongoing hikes to some additional hikes maybe some policy-firming may be appropriate. So going forward as I mentioned in assessing the need for further hikes will be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and in particular on our assessment of the actual unexpected effects of credit tightening. Mr. Chairman can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming? Does firming imply a rate increase per se or could policy firm without you increasing rates? No I think it's meant to refer to our policy rate. Really I would focus on the words may and some as opposed to ongoing. So we clearly were what we were doing there was taking on board the on trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen. I mean it's possible that this will turn out to have very modest effects. These events will turn out to be very very modest effects on the economy in which case an inflation will continue to be strong in which case the you know the path will look might look different. It's also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and in principle if that that that means that monetary policy may have less work to do we simply don't know. Do you have any concerns at the recent that we're hiking did today could further exacerbate the problem in the banks? No I mean we're with our monetary policy we're really focused on macroeconomic outcomes in particular we're focused on on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions. I think when we think about the situation in the banks we're focused on our financial stability tools in particular our lending facilities the debt sorry the discount window and also the new facility. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal at Sherpowell in your testimony two weeks ago you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher obviously that was before the stress in the making sector and I realized there's a lot of uncertainty but can you can you explain it all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts? So you know we just come from an FOMC meeting and you know the people who write them in it will be very carefully counting but I'll tell you what I heard what I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated they would be some some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as as our policies do and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did turn out not to be the case in principle you'd need more rate hikes so some people did reflect that in their in their FOMC in their SCP forecast I think there may also just have been remember this is 12 days ago you know we're trying to assess something that just is so recent and it's people you know it's very difficult there's so much uncertainty so December was a good place to start and we wound up with we wound up with very similar outcomes for December and it you know in a way the the early the data in the first part the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets so that pointed to higher rates and then this this latter part kind of the possibility of of of of credit conditions tightening really really offset that effectively? To follow up have you considered all whether your primary tool the funds rate is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector have you for example considered changing reserve requirements selling assets out of the system open market account as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don't accelerate deposit erosion for example from banks? You know we know that we have other other tools in effect but no we think our monetary policy tool works and we think you know many many banks are rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market and many banks have managed to handle them. Victoria. Hi Victoria Guida with Politico I wanted to ask you along with the FDIC and the Treasury the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks. I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made was it purely a confidence issue or were there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of these banks? The issue was really not about those specific banks but about about the risk of of a contagion to to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly. That was the issue. Okay and then can you also just follow up can you speak to the role that you will be playing in the Fed's internal investigation on its supervision and regulation? So Vice Chair Barr is of course leading that review and he's responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for supervision. We I realized you know right away that that there was going to be a need for a review. I mean the question we were all asking ourselves over that first week and was how did this happen? And so what we did was early Monday morning we sat down and said let's do this and he's he was obviously going to lead it in his capacity. So I don't you know my my role was to announce it and I get briefed on it but I'm not involved in in the work of it. Howard? Chair Powell Howard, Senator from Rooters. So I want to go back to your February press conference. You mentioned the word disinflation I believe nine or ten times. The process that you felt was I forget the word you used but gratefully underway or something like that. Is disinflation still occurring in the US today? Yes I mean what actually happened Howard was I got the question twelve times so it's a maybe it's a feature not a bug but so but yeah I absolutely the pros absolutely the same the story is intact so it's really three parts right. Goods inflation's been coming down now for six months it's proceeding more slowly than we would have liked but it's certainly proceeding. Housing services is really a matter of time passing we continue to see the new leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation so that's 44% of the of the core PC index where you've got a story that's ongoing where we didn't have in February and we still don't have now is a sign of progress in the non-housing services sector and that is you know that's just something that will have to come through through softening demand and perhaps some softening and labor market conditions we don't see that yet and that's that's of course 56% of the index so the story is pretty much the same I will say that the inflation data that we got to your point really pointed to stronger inflation if I could follow up on that I was curious why you don't see more coming from the credit crunch because it seems to me that's something that you'd actually welcome to a degree and expect and are you not seeing more coming from that because you don't know or because you just don't want to have another round of wishful thinking so it's really just a question of not knowing at this point there's a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions economic activity hiring and inflation very large body of literature the question is how significant will this credit tightening be and how how sustained will it be that's that's the issue and we don't really see it yet it's so so people are making estimates you know people are publishing estimates and it's but it's very kind of rule of thumb guesswork almost at this point but we think it's it's potentially quite real and that argues for you know being alert as we go forward as we think about for the right hikes for us we'll be paying attention to the actual unexpected effects from that hi chair pal Gina smile come to your times thank you for taking our questions I wonder if you could talk a little bit I know that you've got your internal review coming but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what",0.0040062096249186,0.005810313306118343
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 18:50:00,2023-03-22 19:00:00," you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward. And I wonder, you know, how can the American people have confidence that there aren't other weaknesses out there in the banking system given that this one got missed as you noted? So let me say what I think happened and then I'll come to the questions around supervision. So at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly. They grew the bank very quickly. They exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Didn't hedge that risk. We now know that supervisors saw these risks and intervened. We know that the public saw all this. We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank room. So this is a very large group of connected depositors, concentrated group of connected depositors and a very, very fast run faster than the historical record would suggest. So as for us, so for our part, we're doing a review of supervision and regulation. My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did this happen? Is the question. What went wrong? Try to find that. We will find that and then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn't happen again and then implement those policies. It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be. I simply can't do that. Vice Chair Bar is leading this and I think he's testifying next week. But that will be up to him. So that's really where it is. The review is going to be thorough and transparent. It is clear to you really to your last question. It's clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation and I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report and I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation. I just, and the final point, can we feel confident that these weaknesses don't exist elsewhere given that they've omitted this bank? These are not weaknesses that are at all broadly through the banking system. So this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk. And again, supervisors did get in there and they were, as you know, obviously, they were on this issue but nonetheless this still happened. So that's really the nature of the interview of the review is to discover that. Michael McKeith from Bloomberg Radio and Television, you've been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time. Following today's decision, the markets have now priced in one more increase in May and then every meeting the rest of this year, they're pricing in rate cuts. Are they getting this totally wrong from the Fed or is there something different about the way you're looking at it given that you're now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing? So we published an SEP today as you will have seen it. It shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand in labor market with inflation moving down gradually. In that most likely case, if that happens, participants don't see rate cuts this year. They just don't. I would just say as always, the path of the economy is uncertain and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we're right down in the SEP. But that's not our baseline expectation. Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1% basically consensus is based on being, it will be sufficiently restrictive or is it leavened by the idea of you don't know what's going to happen? In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal? It's going to depend. Remember, we're looking for purposes of our monetary policy tool. We're looking at what's happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening and credit conditions? And then we're thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do. So in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. So the key is we have to have policies need to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2% over time. It doesn't all have to come from rate hikes. It can come from tighter credit conditions. So we're looking at, and we're, it's highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be. So we're just going to have to watch. In the meantime, you know, and obviously at the end of the day, we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2% and no one should doubt that. Go to Rachel Segal. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Segal from the Washington Post, thank you for taking our questions. I know we've talked a bit about how Silicon Valley bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy. But there's also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year and next. And that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans. Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of what we saw with SVB to banks that disproportionately are focused on commercial real estate? So, you know, we've well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate. I really don't think it's comparable to this. The banking system is strong. It is sound, it is resilient, it's well capitalized. And I really don't see that as at all analogous to this. And one other question. Would you be open to an independent investigation separate from the Fed's probe? I welcome. It's 100% certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that. So, we welcome. When a bank fails, they're investigations and of course we welcome that. Edward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Inflation has been rather sticky. So, do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster? We don't assume that. We don't give advice to the fiscal authorities and we assume that we take fiscal policy as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model along with a million other things. And we have responsibility for price stability. The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that and nothing is going to change that. So, we will get inflation down to 2% in time. And if I can follow on that, but they're working, the spending that's happened is working against what you are doing, right? So, it's prolonging inflation. You know, you have to look at the impulse from spending because spending was of course tremendously high during the pandemic and then as the pandemic programs rolled off spending actually came down. So, the sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what's driving inflation right now. It was at the beginning, perhaps, part of what was driving inflation, but that's not really the story now. It's going to Neil Irwin. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Two questions about aspects of the government's response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago. First, why is this new bank funding facility done under emergency 133 authority as opposed to expansion of the discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that's been around a long time? And second, can you discuss the federal and the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there's $143 billion on your balance sheets last week supporting that deposit guarantee? Sure. So, 133 seemed like the right. We have a little more flexibility on under section 133. We've done quite a lot under the discount window as well. We need to do a special facility that was designed a certain way. So we did it under 133. Really no magic to that. It's only available in unusual and ex-circumstances and it has to be meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place. So, with the FDIC, we're lending to the, in effect, we're lending to the bridge bank. So that's where the funds came from. And it's alone that's 100% guaranteed by the FDIC, so there's no risk for us. Chris Regaber. Thank you, Chris Regaber and Associated Press. The SEB, SEP suggests one more rate hike as does the change in the language in the statement and which suggests that you're perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes. Do you feel though that if inflation remains high, you'll be able to resume additional hikes as needed or have you somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end? Thank you. Absolutely not. If we need to raise rates higher, we will. I think for now though, we, as I've mentioned, we see the likelihood of credit tightening. We know that that can have an effect on the macro economy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we're going to be watching to see what that is. And we'll also be watching what's happening with inflation and in the labor market. So we'll be watching all those things and of course we will eventually get to tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We'll find ourselves at that place. Hi. Hi Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a couple questions about the balance sheet. This fall I'm curious.",-0.0032112718129993,0.004822950246145405
2023-03-22 18:30:00,2023-03-22 19:00:00,2023-03-22 19:10:00," At what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing the balance sheet. And I'm also curious what your thoughts are on the not just the availability of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system. And at what point you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks. So people think of QE and QT in different ways. So let me be clear about how I'm thinking about these recent developments. So recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer term securities. Large scale purchases of long term securities are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down pushing up the price and down the rates longer term rates which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well. The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet the special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions. It's not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy. We do believe that it's working. It's having its intended effect of bolstering confidence into the banking system and thereby forstalling what might otherwise have been in abrupt and outsized tightening and financial conditions. So that's working. In terms of the distribution of reserves we don't see ourselves as running into reserve shortages. We think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to run off predictably and passively is working. And of course we're always prepared to change that if that changes but we don't see any evidence that that's changed. Hi Chair. A lettering a survival with Bloomberg news. The minutes of the January February meeting the last meeting indicate that you discuss the possibility of runs on non bank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios. Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion kind of what was talked about in light of that. And then why didn't the Fed do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent what happened this month. I mean to be honest I don't recall the specifics of that. It's been quite an interesting seven weeks. But I will tell you though that we have there have been presentations about interest rate risk. I mean it's been in all the newspapers. It's not a surprise that there are institutions that have that have had unhedged long positions in long duration securities that have lost value as as longer term rates have gone up due to our rate increases. So that's that's not a surprise. I think as you know as is as is now on the public record the supervisory team was apparently engaged very much engaged with the bank. Repeatedly and was escalating but you know nonetheless what happened happened. And so that's really the purpose of one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Bar is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change. I mean one one thing is the speed of the come back to that the speed of the run it's it's very different for what we've seen in the past. And it does kind of suggest that there's a need for possible regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision regulation need to keep up with what's happening in the world. Can you confirm whether or not the board knew about these escalations by the exam examiners in San Francisco. I will have to come back to you on that. I don't know. Simon or Brinavitch with the economist thank you very much. Chair Powell you've stated twice today that all depositors savings in the banking system are safe. Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings. Shouldn't Congress have a say in that. And just by way of example if a bank with less than a billion dollars in assets failed are you promising to be allowed all of its depositors. Well I'm not saying anything more than I'm saying so but what I'm saying is you've seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to or to the financial system. And we prepare to use those tools and I think depositors should assume that they're that their deposits are safe. Thank you Chair Powell. Greg Robb from Markerwatch. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color you gave just a little bit of color you said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend you said the question you guys asked was how did this happen when you saw Silicon Valley bank. So I was wondering if you could go to the credits we merger I mean wasn't that the big gorilla in the room aren't you didn't you breathe a sigh of relief when that. Merger happened thanks. Sure so you know we that that was really this with government we of course we're following it over the course of the weekend and we were engaged with their authorities in the way that you would expect all the ways that you would expect. It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to and it has been the markets have accepted it and. It seems to have seems to have gone well and I think there was a concern that it might not go well so coming coming into the middle of this week yes I would say that that has gone well so far. Nicole. Hi thank you chair pal Nicole good kind with CNN business in the summary of economic projections that FMC sees the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% this year I'm wondering how you anticipate preventing this from snowballing while using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal. The estimate of what will happen as as demands slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it's just it's it's a highly uncertain estimate and I mean I was really we we have to bring inflation down to 2% the costs of bringing it down there are real costs to bring it down to 2% but the costs of failing are much higher and if you read your history as you I'm sure you have you can see that if if central bank doesn't get inflated. It doesn't get inflation back in place get inflation make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile and it's hard to invest capital it's hard for an economy to perform well and that's we're looking to avoid that and you know and to get back to where we need to be back to where we were for a quarter century and get there as quickly as we can. The question is this briefly it's hard to. Historically it's been hard to contain unemployment and I'm the question is do you worry about some sort of snowball effect and how do you factor that into your projections and your thoughts. It depends on whether you we so recessions tend to be non-linear and so they're very hard to model you know the models all work in a kind of linear way if you have more of this you get more of that but when when our recession happens the reactions tend to be not linear and that's what it so we don't know whether that'll happen this time we don't know if so we don't know what the how significant it will be and so you know we're we're very focused on getting inflation down and because we know in the longer run. And that that is the thing that will most benefit the people we serve that's how we can have a long you know we've had very strong labor markets through these long expansions that we've had four of the five longest or three of the four longest expansions in US history have been really since the high inflation period and the reason was inflation wasn't forcing the central bank to come in and stop an insipient or you know an expansion you can have very very long expansions without high inflate. And we had several of those and they're very good for people you see late in expansion you see low unemployment you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum it's it's just a place that we should try to get back to. Jean. Hi chair Powell, Jean young with market news I just wanted to ask with all the events of the past two weeks do you still see a possibility of a soft landing you as economy. You know it's it's too early to say really whether whether these events have had much of an effect I it's hard for me to see how they would have helped the problem the possibility but I guess I would just say it's it's too early to say whether there really have been. And the question will be how long this period is sustained the longer it's sustained then the greater will be the the the likely. Declines in in or tightening credit standards credit availability so we'll just have to see I do still think though that there's a there's a pathway to that I think that pathway still exists and you know we're certainly trying to find it. Hi chair Powell Nancy Marshall Genser with Marketplace just wondering how many financial institutions have been issued matters requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point how many I don't know. But those are serious those are.",-0.0040395423524689,0.005670362903225807

And getting to the seriousness of it, how are you going to ensure that banks comply with these citations take them seriously? How we enforce them? That is a great question. And is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair of Barr's leadership. So I think that's what you think about. What can we do to make sure that? But again, that's not for me to answer today. Do you have specific thoughts on that? Well, I see if I did, I wouldn't share them, because I really, this review is going on. And I want nothing other than us to find out what happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes. That's all I want. It's for me to be giving you my half-form to or partially informed thoughts. It just isn't appropriate. There's a real serious review going on with people from all of the Federal Reserve system who are not connected to this work, not connected to this bank. And under, again, Vice Chair of Barr's leadership, and I'm confident that it will produce a satisfactory result. OK. We'll go to Jennifer for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. Carrie, how do you view financial conditions right now? If credit becomes expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you're watching for, would that situation warrant a rate cut? What situation would warrant a rate cut? And have the bank failures prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff? Thank you. So we haven't really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation. That's not something we've discussed yet. As I mentioned, we're always willing to change that. If we conclude that it's appropriate, we're really not seeing any signs there. Sorry. Then the question before that was just give me a... Carrie, how you view financial conditions now, and if credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut. So financial conditions seem to have tightened. And probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because the traditional indexes are focused a lot on rates and equities, and they don't necessarily capture lending conditions. So we think that, though. So there are other measures, which, if they're focused on bank lending conditions and things like that, they show some more tightening. The question for us, though, is how significant will that be and how will we be the extent of it, and will be the duration of it? And then once you know that, there's a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands, how that works its way into the economy over what period of time. And so we'll be looking to see the first part of that, how serious is this, and does it look like it's going to be sustained? And if it is, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions. I mentioned with rate cuts. Rate cuts are not in our base case. And so that's all I have to say. So thank you very much.",0.0022444141826801,0.00442008486562942
