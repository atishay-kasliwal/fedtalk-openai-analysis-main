We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy in the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the federal",0.0,0.008868107062238019

In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we've seen in recent months should continue to temper growth.",0.0,0.0

As shown in our summary of economic projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2% through 2024. The labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. Improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African-Americans and Hispanics.

We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting, and it will continue to do so. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by three quarters of a percentage point, resulting in a one and a half percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.

We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside. Some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably. In response to these developments, the committee decided that a larger increase in the target range was warranted at today's meeting. This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels and it will help ensure that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%.

Still above the median longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee plan or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down. Consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. The pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today's 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting. We will, however, make our-",0.0005758981255169007,0.0

And has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.

Did you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July? And would you please give us as detailed a sense you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday?

And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it's helpful to provide even more clarity than usual, again, subject to uncertainty and the outlook. So, and I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have generally shown that they understand the path we're laying out. Of course, it remains data-dependent. And so, that's what we generally think about guidance and that's why we offer it.

And we thought for a while and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So then the question is, what do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is that's not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead. And so we did. And that's really how we made the decision. Thank you, Gina. Thanks for taking our questions. Gina, smile with the New York Times. You, I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you're deciding how aggressive you need to be.

And by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and ideally beginning to decline. We've said that we'd be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attended inflation risks, the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again, surprised to the upside. Some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and projections of this year have moved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point. Rate hike as I mentioned.

But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6%. So, again, the committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we'd like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This was really about the speed with which you would get there. So as I mentioned, we, 75 basis points today, I said the next meeting could, could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would put us at the end of the July meeting, you know, in that range, in that more normal range, and that's a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward.

That's where people are. And that's what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be, we need to show resolve, but also be flexible to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don't need to do that much. So, and if they're not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be very data dependent. Then you're looking at next year in what you're seeing is people see more, a bit more tightening in a range of maybe three and a half to four percent.

You have not used the phrase in a long time, monetary policy is in a good place, which is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the committee is projecting 3.8% next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now. The future is market of 4% funds right next year. Do you think that's a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a follow-up, could you break that apart from me? How much of that is restrictive? And how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not in your opinion in the funds rate? Thank you. Sure.

And we think that's in the mid-toes. You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions. You can look at asset prices. You can look at the effect you're having on the economy. Rates, asset prices, credit spreads, all of those things go into that. You can also look at the yield curve and ask all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive. That's not true at the short end. At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you have negative rates still. So that really is one data point. It's one part of financial conditions. So I think I have to look at it this way. We move the policy rate.

And that desired effect is we'd like to see, you know, demand moderating. Demand is very hot still in the economy. We'd like to see the labor market getting better and balanced between supply and demand. And that can happen both from supply and demand. Right now, there's demand is substantially higher than available supply, though. So we feel that there's a role for us in moderating demand. Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can't affect. And those would be, you know, the things, the commodity price issues that we're having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that.

So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations, so you've got the public, you've got surveys of the public and of experts and you've also got market-based. And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place where short-term inflation is going to be high, but comes down sharply over the next couple of years. That's really where inflation expectations are. And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2%. And so this is really very important to us that that remained the case.

We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations that the board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time. So we're watching that and we're thinking this is something we need to take seriously. And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned, one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points. Today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We're absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2%. That was one of the reasons, the other was just the CPI reading.

You could get to a place where, where that ratio was, was a more, at a more normal level. And you wouldn't expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level.

So you effectively will think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand comes in, and it's very strong. And it shows up in higher prices, not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can't make the cars, because they don't have the semiconductors. So in principle, that could work in reverse. When demand comes down, you could see, and it's not guaranteed, but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we're in on the supply side.

So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly it's our goal to bring about 2% inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right? And that's kind of what the SEP says. The SEP has inflation getting down to a little above 2% in 2024 with unemployment at 4.1%. So this is a strong labor market. This is a good labor market. And as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control.

We see job growth slowing, but it's still at quite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit, but still growth levels at healthy growth levels.

There's always a risk of going too far or going that far enough. And it's going to be a very difficult judgment to make or maybe not, maybe it'll be really clear. But we're, and we're quite mindful of the, of the dangers. I mean, but I will say the, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which it's not an option.
