2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:30:00,2024-09-18 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state. Inflation is eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of August. We're committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. This decision reflects our growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration.",-4.418631334568345e-05,0.0006185931424532039

We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first half of the year, and available data point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its endemic pace last year. In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising strongly in the first. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand in the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.",0.0008921073891324835,0.000671651024267804

In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool. Payroll job gains averaged 116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step down from the pace seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate has moved up, but remains low at 4.2 percent. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs to workers' gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of elevated inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SCP is 4.4 percent at the end of this year, 410's higher than projected in June.",-0.0004509480127636,0.0011130742049469883

Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.2% over the 12 months ending in August. And that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7%. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3% this year and 2.1% next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter the median projection is 2%.

Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. We are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures, and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored. Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. As inflation has declined, and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation have diminished.",-0.002652845665901355,0.0005470845686856896

We now see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance. And we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. In late of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks at today's meeting, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point to 4.3 quarters percent to 5 percent. This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could undo a weak economic activity and employment.",0.0008512645942715001,0.002829955074463233

In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4% at the end of this year and 3.4% at the end of 2025. These median projections are lower than in June, consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks. These projections, however, are not a committee plan or decision.

At the labor market, we're to weaken unexpectedly, or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated. We are prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you.

In July, you said you weren't necessarily thinking about a 50. You didn't want to be specific, but you said you weren't thinking about a 50. The inflation data last week came out a little firmer than expected. Retail was strong through quarter GDP running 3%. So what changed and made the committee go 50 and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it shows the Fed is more concerned about the labor market? And I guess should we expect more 50s in the months ahead? And based on what should we make that call? Thank you. So okay, a lot of questions in here. Let me jump in. So since the last meeting, okay, the last meeting, we have had a lot of data come in. We've had the two employment reports July and August. We've also had two inflation reports, including one that came in during blackout. We had the QCEW report which suggests that maybe that not maybe, but suggests that the payroll report not.",-0.0018374429742485,0.001379115244527693

So we took all of those and we went into blackout and we thought about what to do and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve and that's how we made our decision. So that's one question. What was the second authority? We make this, sorry, thank you sir. How do we figure out in the months ahead is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what shall we make that call? Thank you. Sure, so a couple of things. A good place to start is the SEP but let me start with what I said, which was that we're gonna be making decisions meeting by meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.

And that process will take place over time. There's nothing in the SEP that suggests the committee is in a rush to get this done. This process evolves over time. Of course, that's a projection, that's a baseline projection. We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do will depend on the way the economy evolves. We can go quicker if that's appropriate. We can go slower if that's appropriate. We can pause if that's appropriate. But that's what we are contemplating. Again, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of what the committee is thinking today, but the individual members, rather than the committee, are thinking today, assuming that their particular forecasts are realized.

The projections show that the Fed, Fed officials expect the Fed funds rate to still be above their estimate of long-worn neutral by the end of next year. So does that suggest you see rates as restrictive for that entire period? Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you said you'd like to avoid? Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short-run neutral as a little bit higher than the one? I think it would, the way I would really characterize it as this, I think people write down their estimate individuals do. I think every single person on the committee, if you ask them what's your level of certainty around that, they would say there's a wide range where that could fall. So I think we don't know. There are model-based approaches and empirically-based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time, but realistically we know it by its works. So that leads us in a place where we expect, in the base case, to be continually to remove restriction and we'll be looking at the way the-",3.5077338357400044e-05,0.001221995926680341

We know if you go back we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a time when unemployment was 3.5% and inflation was 4.2%. Today unemployment is up to 4.2% and inflation is down to a few tents above two. So we know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even and this is the beginning of that process. I mentioned the direction of which is toward a sense of neutral and we'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real time.

How close was this in terms of decision? You do have the first dissent by a governor since 2005, I think, was the weight clearly in favor of a 50 or was this a very close decision? I think we had a good discussion. If you go back, I talked about this in Jacksonville, but I didn't address the question of the size of the cut left it open and I think we left it open going into blackout. And so there was a lot of discussion back and forth, good diversity and an excellent discussion today. I think there was also broad support for the decision that the committee voted on. So I would add though, look at the SCP, all 19 of the participants wrote down multiple cuts this year, all 19. That's a big change from June, right?",0.0012213575282787,0.002129207402544282

So you know there is a descent and there's a range of views but there's actually a lot of common ground as well. Follow up to that. Now that this is in the books, do you give us some guidance that's sort of involved just on the pacing here? Would you expect this to be running every other meeting once we get into next year? We're going to take it meeting by meeting. As I mentioned, there's no sense that the committee feels it's in a rush to do this. We made a good strong start to this and that's really frankly a sign of our confidence. Confidence and inflation is coming down toward 2% on a sustainable basis. That gives us the ability. We can make a good strong start and I'm very pleased that we did.

Gina Smiley with the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the unemployment rate climbing to 4.4% and staying there. Obviously, historically, when the unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn't typically just stop. It could continue using increasing. And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the labor market stabilizing, sort of what's the mechanism there and what do you see as the risks? So again, the labor market is actually in a solid condition. And our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there. You can say that about the whole economy. The US economy is in good shape. It's growing at a solid pace. The inflation is coming down. The labor market is in a strong pace. We want to keep it there.",0.0010411333267874002,0.0019525356337753567

Chair Powell, does today's action constitute a catch-up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data? Or is this larger than typical rate cut a function of the elevated nomencl level of the policy rate such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue? Okay. Multiple questions there. So I would say we don't think we're behind. We do not think we're right. We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. So it's a strong move. So your other question was? Well is this about what happened in the employment data between this meeting and the last meeting or is this about the level of the funds rate, the high nomencl level of funds rate relative?",-0.0037182051740659,0.002002587413826706

I think it's about, we come into this with a policy position that was put in place as, you know, I mentioned in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation and very low unemployment. We've been very patient about reducing the policy rate. We've waited, other central banks around the world have cut many of them several times. We've waited and I think that that patient says really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably into 2%. So I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today. I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, oh, this is the new pace. You know, you have to have to think about it in terms of the base case. Of course, what happens will happen. So in the base case, what you see is look at the SCP. You see cuts moving along.

The economy can develop in a way that would cause us to go faster or slower, but that's what the base case says. And in the second follow-up on the balance sheet. In 2019 when you did the mid-cycle adjustment and you ceased the balance sheet runoff with a larger cut today, is there any signal inferred about how the committee would approach end-state on the balance sheet policy? So in the current situation reserves have really been stable. They haven't come down. So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time. As you know the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight RRP. So I think what that tells you is we're not thinking about stopping runoff because of this at all.

Koby Smith with the Financial Times. I'm just following up on Gina's question on rising unemployment. Is it your view that this is just a function of a normalizing labor market, a mid-improve supply? Or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened, too? And I guess in Darifalc, Gina, why should we not expect a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrictive? So I think what we're seeing is clearly labor market conditions have cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole. But there's still at a level. The level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment. So you're close to mandate, maybe at mandate on that.

But ultimately we think we believe with an appropriate recalibration of our policy that we can continue to see the economy growing and that will support the labor market. In the meantime if you look at the growth in economic activity data, retail sales data that we just got second quarter GDP all of this indicates an economy that is still growing at a solid pace.

So we're not waiting for that. Because there is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it's strong, and not when you begin to see the layoffs. There's some lore on that. So that's the situation we're in. We have, in fact, begun the cutting cycle now, and we'll be watching, and that'll be one of the factors that we consider.

Sure. So we'll start with unemployment, which is the single most important one probably. You're at 4.2%. That's, you know, I know the tire then we were used to seeing numbers in the mid and even below mid-3s last year. But if you look back over the sweep of the years, that's a low, that's a very healthy unemployment rate. And anything in the low fours is a really, is a good labor market. So that's one thing. Participation is at high levels. We've had, we're right adjusted for demographics for aging. Participation is at pretty high levels. That's a good thing. Wages are still a bit above what would be, their wage increases rather are still just a bit above where they would be over the very longer term to be consistent with 2% inflation.

It's not as high as it was that number reached two to one, two vacancies for every unemployed person has measured. It's now below around one, but that's still a very good number, I would say. Quits have come back down to normal levels. I mean, that could go on and on. There are many, many employment indicators. What do they say? They say this is still a solid labor market. The question isn't the level. The question is that there has been change over particularly over the last few months. And so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risk to inflation have really come down, the downside risk to employment have increased.

And what do you expect to learn between now and November that will help inform the scale of the cut of the next?",-0.00019463533809769998,0.0016636579236134201

You know more data the usual don't look for anything else we'll see another labor report we'll see another jobs report I think we get a we actually get two we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting I think I know now on the Friday before the meeting so and inflation data we'll get we'll get all this data we'll be watching you know it's it's always a question of look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and think what's the right thing to do is policy where we want it to be too foster the achievement of our goals over time so that's what it is and that that's what we'll be doing.

And one of the welcome trends of the last couple of years has been labor market steam coming out through job openings falling rather than job losses. Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor market cooling will have to come through job losses? So on the job creation, it depends on the inflows, right? So if you're having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you're creating 100,000 jobs, you're going to see unemployment go up. So it really depends on what's the trend that underline the volatility of people coming into the country. We understand there's been quite an influx across the borders. And that has actually been one of the things that's that's allowed unemployment rate to rise. And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate, which is something we also watch carefully. So it does depend on what's happening on the supply side. And on the beverage curve question.",-0.001791862124249,0.0006523226398382001

And yes, I think we are, it's hard to know that you can't know these things with great precision, but certainly it appears that we're very close to that point if not at it so that further declines in job openings will translate more directly into unemployment. But it's been a great ride down, I mean we've seen a lot of tightness come out of the labor market in that form without it resulting in lower employment. Thanks, Chip, Edward Lawrence, Fox Business.

Intuitively, most many, many people in any way would say we're probably not going back to that era where there were trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates, long term bonds trading at negative rates. And it looked like the neutral rate might even be negative. So there was people were issuing, issuing, get at negative rates. It seems that's so far away now.

Thank you, Chair Powell. I'm Jolli Kent with CBS News. My first question is very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the American people, with this unusually large rate cut? I would just say that the U.S. economy is in a good place and our decision today is designed to keep it there. More specifically, the economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation is coming down closer to our 2% objective over time. And the labor market is still in solid shape. So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we currently see in the U.S. economy. And we'll do that by returning rates from their high level, which has really been the purpose of which has been to get inflation under control.",0.0028600757561059002,0.0019382257232783253

Listening to you talk about inflation moving meaningfully down to 2%. Is the federal reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices? No. We're not. So inflation, you know, what we say is we want inflation. The goal is to have inflation move down to 2% on a sustainable basis. And, you know, we're not really, we're close, but we're not really at 2%. And I think we're going to want to see it be, you know, around 2% and close to 2% for some time. But we're certainly not doing, we're not saying mission accomplished or anything like that. But I have to say though, we're encouraged by the progress that we have made. Okay.

I just would love to know kind of how the committee is thinking about the persistence we've seen in housing inflation. Do you think you can return to 2% with housing inflation where it is? Yeah. So housing inflation is the one piece that is kind of dragging a bit if I can say. We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which is to be moving up at relatively low levels. But they're not rolling over. The leases that are rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high. So it's been slower than we expected. I think we now understand that it's going to take some time for those lower market rents to get into this. The direction of travel is clear.

So that's, I think we understand that now, but I don't think the outcome is endowed again as long as market rents remain under control. The outcome is not endowed. So I would say it's the rest of the port full or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation or have behaved pretty well. You know, they all have some volatility. We will get down to 2% inflation, I believe. And I believe that ultimately we'll get what we need to get out of the housing services piece too. Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that with starting to cut rates, you could reignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more. You know, what's the likelihood of that and how would you react to that? The housing market, it's hard to gain that out.

So because they have a very low mortgage, it'd be quite expensive to refinance. As rates come down, people will start to move more and that's probably beginning to happen already. But remember when that happens, you've got to sell it, but you've also got a new buyer in many cases. So it's not obvious how much additional demand that would make me. The real issue with housing is that we have had and are on track to continue to have not enough housing. And so it's going to be challenging. It's hard to find to zone lots that are in places where people want to live. It's all of the aspects of housing are warmer, difficult. And where are we going to get the supply? And this is not something that the Fed can really fix. But I think as we normalize rates, you'll see the housing market normalize.

Just following up on some of the labor market talk earlier, monetary policy operates with long and variable legs. And I'm wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate raising too much, comes from the fact that you're starting to act now. And that's going to give people more room to run versus just the labor market is strong. And then also if I could following up on Nick's question, do you see today's 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that you didn't cut in July? And that sort of gets you to the same place. So you're right about legs. But I would just point to the overall economy.

And as I said, you can see our 50 basis point move as a commitment to make sure that we don't fall behind. So you're really asking about your second question. You're asking about July. And I guess if you ask if we'd gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut, we might well have. We didn't make that decision, but we might well have.

And as if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come down as well. However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs. We can't look a year ahead and know what the economy is to be doing. What's your message to households who are frustrated that home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?

And when that happens, part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy off in order to reduce inflationary pressures. It's not something that people experience as pleasant. But at the end, what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored. And a good definition of price stability is that people in their daily decisions they're not thinking about inflation anymore. That's where everyone wants to be, is back to what's inflation. Just keep it low, keep it stable. We're restoring that. So what we're going through now really will benefit people over a long period of time. Price stability benefits everybody over a long period of time, just by virtue of the fact that they don't have to deal with inflation. So that's what's been going on.

You've mentioned how closely you're watching the labor market, but you also noted that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions.

There is in a bright line, you know, it will be, the unemployment rate is very important of course, but there is in a single statistic or a single bright line over which that thing, that might move that would dictate one thing or another. We'll look at each meeting, we'll look at all the data on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market, and we'll make decisions about is our policy stance where it needs to foster over the medium term or mandate goals.

Can you tell the public why you view that so important? Sure, so countries that are democracies around the world, countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office, as opposed to people who are not in office.

So yes, that is, you know, that's happening with my support. That's not a final proposal though, you understand. We're putting them out for comment. We're going to take comment and make appropriate changes. We don't have a calendar date for that. And as for the other agencies, you know, the idea is that we're all moving together.

And we had inflation way above target. So that said to us, concentrated inflation, concentrated inflation. And we did for a while. And we kept at that, that the stance that we put in place 14 months ago was a stance that was focused on bringing down inflation. Part of bringing down inflation, though, is cooling off the economy and the little bit cooling off the labor market. You now have a cooler labor market in part because of our activity. So what that tells you is, it's time to change our stance. So we did that.
