We have both the tools that we need and the resolve that will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points and we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2.",0.0,0.006347479143997068

Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter, but is unchanged so far this year. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed in...",0.0,0.0

Job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs, and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12-month ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent.",-0.0040789014582867,0.0

Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship and as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs.",0.0,0.0

We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. With today's action, we've raised interest rates by three and three-quarters percentage points this year. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate, in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time.

There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go.

We're taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Having price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country.

On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and let's say the December meeting. Or is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with independent of that data given the lag defects that you mentioned? So a couple of things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course, that's what we'd all love to see. But that's, I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level?

Look, I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in December or not. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis, when it agrees? So what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program, if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way.

So on the first question, how fast to tighten policy, it's been very important that we move expeditiously and we have clearly done so. We've moved three and three quarters percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace and that's certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength and inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question which is how high to raise our policy rate and we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our two percent target over time and we put that into our post-meeting statement because that really does become the important question we think now is how far to go and I'll talk more about that.

And as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both the strong labor market report, but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain, though, and I would say we're going to find it over time. Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there's a lot of uncertainty. So we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, as well as the lags with the monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second, third questions.

To be clear, let me say again, the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high it erases rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus. If I could follow up on that, to what degree was there an importance or a weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns really around the globe about fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else, you know, dealing with their own stress as a result? Well, I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have. I don't think we've over tightened.

And we did discuss this, and as I mentioned, we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no, I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast.

So this is the question of does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate? And I would say there are a range of views on that. That's the classic Taylor principle view. But I would think you'd look more at a forward looking measure of inflation to look at that. But I think the answer is we'll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone though. I think you put some weight on that. You also put some weight on rates across the curve.

If I could follow up what is your best assessment or the staff's best assessment right now of the current rate of underlying inflation? I don't have a specific number for you there there are many many models that look at that and I mean one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs above above that level for sure substantially above for some time you'll see it move up but the movement will be will be fairly gradual so I think that's what that's what the principal models would would tend to say but I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment there are many different as you know many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation.

I wonder, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is or is it risk of becoming entrenched? Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit in the middle part of this year and they've moved now back down. That's one piece of data. Short term inflation expectation that moved up between the last meeting and this meeting. And we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning.

So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter. And you know, the truth is we don't have a lot of data of inflation of this high in what is now the minor economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react. And then that would affect economic activity and inflation. Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy. That's the way it is moved for a quarter of a century in the direction of financial conditions than monetary policy because the markets are thinking what is the central bank going to do.

Remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy. Whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we don't tighten enough, now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched.

Of course, we think about the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy, but we will be thinking about them, but we won't be, you know, I think we'll be considering them, but because it's appropriate to do so.

Housing, the housing part of it. Yeah, so we look at housing. Of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the global financial crisis. They're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been. And you're seeing housing activity decline.

So we're seeing we see those difficulties. The strong dollar is a challenge for some countries but you know we have it and we take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States we have a strong economy and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent. Core PCE inflation which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us is the way we see it is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 36 and 9-month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation of the control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do.

Getting it back is something that provides value to the people we serve for the long run. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and there's some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down? So we don't directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong, in many other jurisdictions, the principle problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue.",0.0,0.0

So our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. You're right, though. We don't, you know, the price of oil is set globally, and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep, you know, longer term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even at times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high.

Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? Sure. So you're right. The public's trust is really the Fed's and any central banks, most important asset. And any time one of us, one of the policy makers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust. And we take that very seriously, we do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a committee discussion of the full committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications.

And you said, quote, if it's inverted, that means the Fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak. That curve is only two basis points away from inversion now. So I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a leg. Well, so we do monitor the near term forward spread. You're right.

And also, you have to look at why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve. So yes, we monitor it. You're right. And that's what I would say. If I could follow up, you also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit? Well, what's happened is time has passed, and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points.

But if we over tighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road and you're realizing inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk really is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking. And the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So that isn't going to change.

Chris Ruggabur, and Associated Press. Just to go back to housing for a minute, you mentioned the impact that right increases of hat on housing. Home sales are down 25% in the past year and so forth. But none of this is really showing up and, as you know, in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's overtightening going on?

And that makes sense, actually, because for that reason, that conceptually, that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners equivalent rent, which comes off of, it's a re-weighting of tenant rents. And private measures are, of course, good at picking up the, you know, at the margin, the new leases. And, you know, they tell you a couple things. One thing is, once you, so I think right now, if you look at the pattern, a pattern of that series of the new leases, it was, it was very pro-cyclical. So rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did. And now they're coming down faster.

You still, they're still in the pipeline, there's still some significant rate increases coming. Okay, but at some point once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you that what they're telling you is there will come a point at which, at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we are now. So we're well aware of that of course, and we look at it. But I would say that in terms of the right way to think of that inflation really is to look at the measure that we do look at. But considering that we also know that at some point you'll see rents coming down. Great, we did. Just a quick follow.

You know, our message should be, what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go. We have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question really as the important one now going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September, the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher. And that's been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast, if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SCP today, you know, the pattern has been that one after another, they go up.

You know, in theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending. Even in, so I think those two things do tend to wage to sort of counterbalance each other out. It appears consumer spending is still positive. It's at pretty modest growth levels. It's not shrinking, but, you know, people are, you know, the banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they're still, you know, real, they're fine. So I don't know how big the fiscal headwinds are. And they haven't shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending. So it must have to do with the savings that people have.

I would say the path is narrowed over the course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and to many economists, there is a path to, there's an ordinarial that there's a relationship to GP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment or there's Oaken's law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data and they're very real.
