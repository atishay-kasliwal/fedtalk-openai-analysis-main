2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:30:00,2024-03-20 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased substantially while the labor market has remained strong and that is very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting down",0.0,0.003895046895589472

As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment.

Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply. The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate has edged up, but remains low at 3.9%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Numeral wage growth has been easing and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply.",0.0060073409381881,0.0

The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year. Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. It's based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12-month ending in February and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.

The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.

We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective.

We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation, and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.",0.0,0.0042070569988369

Of course, we're committed to both sides of our dual mandate and an unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6% at the end of this year, 3.9% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2026.

Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5 trillion since the committee began reducing our portfolio. At this meeting, we discussed issues related to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings. While we did not make any decisions today on this, the general sense of the committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of runoff fairly soon, consistent with the plans we previously issued. The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise, but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually. In particular, slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that money markets experience stress, and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings.",-0.00221133753418,0.0

Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness to slow the economy to achieve that target? Well, it doesn't, no, it doesn't mean that. What it means is that, you know, we've seen incoming, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark up our growth forecast and so have many other forecasters. So the economy is performing well. And the inflation data came in a little bit higher as a separate matter. And I think that caused people to write up their inflation. But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on bringing inflation down.

Thanks for taking our questions. You and others have been saying that relief on housing inflation is coming, but it still hasn't shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE. Does that challenge your assumption about when the shift will finally break through since it hasn't at that point? So I think there's some confidence that the market rents, lower market rent increases that we're seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation over time. There's a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen, but there's real confidence that they will.",0.0,0.0026491346804602234

And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if housing doesn't break through quickly? And does that affect the timing for the eventual cuts this year? We will get aggregate inflation down to 2% over time, we will. And I would assume that we'll continue to see is, we'll see goods prices coming into a new equilibrium where they're going down perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this year. Where housing services inflation will come back down as current market rents or suggesting will happen. And where non-housing services will move back down. Some combination of those three things, and it may be different from the combination we had before the pandemic will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2% sustainably.

At the same time you said here after the last meeting that the first cut is highly consequential. Can you reconcile these views from me? If rates are well above neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential? Is that because you anticipate one cut would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019 which itself was modeled on the mid-cycle adjustment of 1995? It's more, I would put it more in the context of what I said in my opening remarks that the risks are really too sided here. We're in a situation where if we ease too much or too soon we could see inflation come back and if we ease too late we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people's working lives.

We can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that. That's really what I was thinking. How much of that inflation that we've seen so far this year, do you chalk up to one off calendar adjustment effects, following a period of high inflation versus some change in the trend we saw in the second half of last year? I want to start by being saying, I always try to be careful about dismissing data that we don't like. So you need to check yourself on that and I'll do that. But I would say the January number, which was very high, the January CPI and PCE numbers were quite high. There's reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there. But nonetheless, we don't want to be completely dismissive of it. The February number was high, higher than expectations.

I also don't think that those readings added to anyone's confidence that we're moving closer to that point. But you know, we didn't, I'd less thing I'll say is we didn't excessively celebrate the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year. We didn't take too much signal out of that. What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could, you know, we wanted to be careful about that decision.

In terms of our rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that's really your question, I don't think we know that.

But I don't think we know.

Is it right to say that this suggests you're not seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we've seen 2023?

In fact, they were decreasing. So you can have that if you have the continued supply side activity that we had last year with both with supply chains and also with growth in the size of the labor force. But so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to hold off on rate cuts? No, not all by itself. No, I mean, we saw, you saw last year very strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.

How do you assess the state of financial conditions right now? And particularly in particular, do you view the kind of easing in financial conditions since the fall is consistent and compatible with what you're trying to achieve on the inflation mandate? So we think there are many different financial conditions indicators, and you can kind of see different answers to that question. But ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity. And we think you see that in a great place to see it as in the labor market where you've seen demand cooling off a little bit from the extremely high levels.

Are they more one-off increases that will fade or is there more of a secular turn with good prices rising again and service prices staying sticky? And also, housing prices have been sort of the go-do of this cycle in that you keep expecting them to go down and they don't.

So the question is, what are we going to see? We tend to see a little bit stronger. This is in the data, a little bit stronger inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year. We're going to let the data show.

You talked about a significant deterioration in the labor market being a condition for easing rates. What would constitute that in your books? Thank you. So we, of course, monitor the one of our two goal variables. We all monitor the labor market very, very carefully. And I don't see those cracks today. And we follow all the possible stories that are out there about there being cracks. But the overall picture really is strong labor market. The extreme imbalances that we saw in the early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved. You're seeing high job growth. You're seeing big increases in supply. You're seeing strong wage growth. But wage growth is gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels.

There isn't much runoff among MBS right now, but there isn't treasuries, and we're talking about going to a lower pace.

In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon, I wouldn't want to try to be more specific than that, but you get the idea. The idea is, and this is in our longer run plans, that we may actually be able to get to a lower level because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.

And will there be a discussion about returning to an all treasuries balance sheet at some point? So that our longer run goal is to return to a balance sheet that is mostly treasuries. I do expect that once we're through this, we'll come back to the other issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues. But it's not urgent right now.

Do you worry that as deposits start to shrink that we could see more turbulence? We'll be watching carefully, but one of the reasons we're slowing down, we will soon enough, fairly soon, I should say, slow down, is that we want to avoid any kind of that of turbulence. I wasn't thinking particularly about a bed banking sector turbulence, but we had some indicators the last time. This is our second time in doing this, and I think we're going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle, where we wound up in a short reserve situation.

We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs though. Well is it also because you're not sure exactly how the Reserve Supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near at zero? Well I think we broadly think that once the overnight repo stabilizes either at zero or close to zero, that as the balance sheet shrinks we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar for dollar with that. That's what we think. Hi Chair Powell, Gene Young with M&I Market News. I wanted to ask also about the balance sheet.

The idea is that with a smoother transition, you won't, you'll run much less risk of kind of liquidity problems which can grow into shocks and which can cause you to stop the process prematurely.

We want to have a cushion above her because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile. And we don't want to, again, find ourselves in a situation where there aren't reserves. We have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did in 2019-20. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Gincer with Marketplace. Chirpall, you said you're waiting to become more confident than inflation is getting to your 2% goal before you cut rates. Can you just sum up more specifically what data you're looking at that would give you that confidence? Sure.

But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong. But they've been wage increases that is to say wage increases have been quite strong.

So we are not getting ready to, we haven't proposed, we haven't come to a conclusion that we should propose or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to authorize a digital dollar.

And is there more that you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front and what might that look like? I generally think this movement actually started 30 years ago, when some academics have posited that a more transparent central bank if the public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you, they will react to the data. And so it all happens that way. And so there's been a march toward greater and greater transparency. And that certainly Chairman Brunanke advanced that so Chairman Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did.

Well, we'll just have to see how the data come in. We would of course love to get great inflation data. We got really good inflation data on the second part of last year.
