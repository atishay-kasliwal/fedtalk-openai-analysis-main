We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. This stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to...",0.0,0.011475538982694794

In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. While weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports.",0.0,0.0

Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months. The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.

Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer-run normal level. median remains well above our 2 percent longer-run goal. Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.

Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Despite elevated inflation, longer term deflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.

We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective.

We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions.

I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop. So I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.

We think we'll need to do two things in particular to achieve a period of growth below trend and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market. So on the first committee's forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second though, so far there's only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a bit. As you know, quits are off their all-time highs. There's some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up. Payroll gains have moderated but not much. And in light of the high inflation we're seeing, we think we'll need to, and in light of what I just said, we think that we'll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level.",0.0,0.0

First, we'll want to see growth continuing to run below trend. We'll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand. And ultimately, we'll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2%. So that's what we'll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we'd want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2% before we would consider that. See. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Steve Leesman, CNBC.

Thank you. Sure. So of course, monetary policy does famously work with long and variable lags. The way I think of it is our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions. Then changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly within a few months. But it's likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I noted in my opening remarks that at some point as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that's how we think about that.",0.0,0.0

Is it linear that you keep raising rates or is there, oh, sorry. I should know better than to not talk with my microphone. I should know better than to answer your second question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy, the rate increase or is there a time to catch up in the real economy? Thank you. So I think it's very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2% where we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SCP numbers is people's views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now those will evolve over time.",-0.013663463807383699,0.0

There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we're confident in and stay there for a time. But we're not at that level. Clearly today we're just move, I think, probably into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive. And certainly, in my view, in the view of the committee, there's a ways to go. All right, Chair Powell, Rachel Seagull from Washington Post, thank you for taking our questions. The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% next year. And historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it. Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing? And is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down? Right, so you're right. And in the SEP, there's what I would characterize it.",0.0,0.0

Now, why is that? So really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways. And I'll mention a couple of those. First, and you know these, but first job openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work. It's plausible, I'll say, that job openings could come down significantly, and they need to, without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that's one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored. And as I've said, there's no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the third thing I would point to that's different this time.",0.0,0.0

So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles. And in principle, if those things start to get better, and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that, it's not much more than that, but it's good to see that. For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now, supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events, it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline, a rather increase in unemployment and a soft landing.",0.0,0.01219385367375591

No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be. That's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored and whether, you know, also do we get more labor supply, which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless, we're committed to getting inflation back down to 2%, because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on. Just to follow as one's long thing, are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes. Vacancies are still almost two to one ratio to unemployed people. That's that and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different.",0.0,0.0

And by that, I mean, is meaningfully putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. That's what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also know that there are long and variable legs, particularly, as they relate to inflation. And so it's a challenging assessment. So what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions. As you know, you look at where rates are real and nominal. In some cases, you look at credit spreads, you look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think, and you see this in the, is this something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings? And you see this, I think, in the committee forecast.

But there's also, there's another fairly large group that saw 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be 25 basis points less. So we're going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn't make that decision today. We didn't vote on that. I would say that we're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly. And that's what we're thinking about. So just as a follow up to that, I'm wondering about this sort of risk management considerations you're given. There's some discussion now of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is? So what we've seen is inflation has.

We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3, 6, and 12 month trailing annualized basis, you'll see that that inflation is at 4.8%, 4.5%, and 4.8%. So that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So what that tells us is that we need to continue and we can keep doing these and we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to.

Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that cornflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025 and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024? And does that mean there's a level of inflation above the 2% target that the Fed is willing to tolerate? So I guess corn is at 2.1 in 2025 and the median and headline is at 2.0 so that's pretty close. I mean we write down our forecasts and we figure out what the median is and we publish it.

Yeah, so as we said, at the last press conference, and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in. So if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and that is surprisingly high reading for August. So I think you can't really never want to overreact too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together, and as I just mentioned, if you really, really look at this year's inflation, 36 and 12 month railing, you see inflation is running too high. It's running 4.5% or above. You don't need to know much more than that.

So we're having an effect on interest sensitive spending. I think through exchange rates, we're having an effect on exports and imports. I think so all of that's happening. But you're right. And we've said this. This is a strong robust economy. People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn't spend and where they were getting government transfers. They're still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum. But it's.",0.0,0.0

So there's a good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now the data, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year. We think of trend as being about 1.8% in that range. We're forecasting growth well below that and most forecasters are. But you're right, there's certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that. And that's a good thing because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn. But of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2%. We can't fail to do that. I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.",0.0,0.0

And you see that I think in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we'll be moving to, reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP. So that's how we think about it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In a world of euphemisms that we live in here with below trend growth and modest increase in unemployment, I'm wondering if I could ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people. Do the odds now favor given where you are and where you're going with interest rates favor a recession? 4.4% unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs, is that acceptable job loss? And then given that the data you look at is backward looking and the lags in your policy are forward looking and you don't know what they are, how will you know or will you know if you've gone too far?",0.0,0.004972289843062143
2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 19:01:00,2022-09-21 19:02:00, So I don't know what the odds are. I think that there's a very high likelihood that will have a period of what I mentioned is below trend growth by which I mean much lower growth. And we're seeing that now. So the median forecast I think this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth. So that's very slow growth. And then below trend next year I think the median was 1.2 also well below. So that's a very slow level of growth and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think that's so that is something that we think we need to have and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. You know we're never going to say that there are too many people working but the real point is this. Inflation what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation. If we want to set ourselves up.,0.0,0.0

I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't. So what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we're putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. And that's what we're doing. And we certainly don't hope. We certainly haven't given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. On the less we need to complete this task. But how will you know or will you go if you've gone too far? Hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean, our again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be. And as I said, you can look at this SEP as today's estimate of where we think those rates would be, of course, they will evolve over time.",-0.0004910824393521002,0.0

You've said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability. And you've suggested maybe there isn't a trade-off in the long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern as people have been expressing here about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of the rate hikes. So can you explain though what about high inflation now? Or threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to suggest that inflation, high inflation, will eventually be to a weaker job market. So can you spell that out a little more for the general public and how that would work? So for starters, people are seeing their wage increases, their wage increases eaten up by inflation.

You don't have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that's what we're hearing from people is very much that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation? And as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn't. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment. And the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply side improvements and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed. In any case, our job is to deliver price stability.

And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is you're just postponing. The record shows that if you postpone that, that delay is only likely to lead to more pain. So I think we're moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that's what you see us doing. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. I had a little orange for Fox Business. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain? How long? It really depends on how long it takes for wages and more than that price is to come down for inflation to come down.

And I think once you're on that path, that's a good thing. And things will start to feel better to people. They'll feel lower inflation. They'll feel the economy is improving. And also, if our projections are close to right, you'll see that the costs in unimagine employment are, they're meaningful and they're certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But at the same time, we'd be setting the economy up for another long period. This era has been noted for very long expansions. We've had three of the four longest in measured history since we got inflation under control. And that's not an accident.

What I'm really saying is that we've had a time of a red hot housing market all over the country where famously houses were selling to the first buyer at 10% above the ask before even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the deceleration and housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with RANCE and other housing market fundamentals. And that's a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level, at a reasonable pace, and that people can afford houses again.

So this is something that, as you can see, they've moved up and we're going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go.
