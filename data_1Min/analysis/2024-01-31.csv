2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:30:00,2024-01-31 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleague is and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high on going progress in bringing it down is not assured. In the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy.",0.0,0.0004719576285104008

As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3%. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1%. Bolstered by strong consumer demand, as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been way.",0.0,0.0

Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that seen a year ago, but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.

Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%.

Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.

We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% of points, and we've decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.

We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we've seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%.

How are you weighing the growth data and consumption data which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data? Okay, so what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We're looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And, implicitly, we do have confidence and has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data.

It's just the question of can we take that with confidence that we're moving sustainably down to 2%. That's really what we're thinking about. In terms of growth, we've had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth, very strong growth last year, going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down. So I think, whereas a year ago, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening and economic activity.

When you say that you want to make sure that the true signal is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it's a true signal at this stage? No, I think it's, I would say it seems to be the likely case that we will achieve that confidence. But we have to achieve it and we haven't yet. And so, I mean it's a good story. We have six months of good inflation. But you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation, for example.

And partly for the reasons that you say, we feel like inflation is coming down. Growth has been strong, the labor market is strong. What we're trying to do is identify a place where we're really confident about inflation and get it going back to 2% so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level. So overall, I think people do believe, and as you know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year. But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting a process, we need some confirmation that inflation isn't that coming down. Sustainably to 2%.

What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current instance? Well, look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor rules and non-tailor kind of rules. We consult them regularly. They're in our teal book and they're in all the materials that we look at. But, you know, I don't think we've ever been at a place where we were setting policy by them. And they're depending on the rule, it will tell you different things or many different formulations. Another way to think about it is implicitly is, so in theory, of course, real rates go up if holding all else equal as inflation comes down. But that doesn't mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates, sorry, as inflation comes down. Does it mean that at all? Because for one thing, we don't know.

So we're really in a risk management mode of managing the risk, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, managing the risk that we move too soon and move too late.

The inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2%. Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. I'd like you to key it on the use of the word in the statement that inflation still remains elevated.

Yeah, I don't know if that we worked out the particular statement language and that kind of thing. I would just say, you look at where 12-month inflation is and it's still well above, core is 2.9%, for example, 12 months, which is way down from where it was, very, very positive development, very fast decline. And the case is likely that it will continue to come down. So that's where it is. But we're wanting to see more data. So if I could follow up on that, the statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut. But it doesn't mention the other side of the mandate, a slighted employment. Would a slighted employment also bring you to the point of cutting rates? Yes, so let me say that we're not looking for that. That's not something we're looking for. Yes, if you think about, in the base case,",0.0,0.0

If we saw an unexpected weakening in certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner, absolutely.

That's what people are writing their SEP around.

Including rent costs? Yeah. Well, so we're not, you know, it's not the pandemic. So we can actually rely on more traditional forms. People are working, they're getting wages and the economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn't say we're looking at that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you point to rent. So of course, we follow the components of inflation very carefully, which would be goods inflation. I talked about that a little bit. You mentioned housing inflation. So the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rent stagion, as measured in PCE inflation? And we think that's coming. And we know it's coming.

You know, the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were in addition. It takes time for the healing process to get into prices so there may be still a tail and we'll find out with that. So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully and as you would imagine. I guess this is a quick follow-up. Do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing or is that part of looking for more confidence? No, I wouldn't say we would achieve that and I think we have a ways to go. Inflation is still, you know, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis. 12 months is our target.

So I'm wondering what you could tell me, how do you believe the neutral rate is working, we're telling you right now that growth is stronger. In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? I think you do see in the interest sensitive parts of the economy, you do see, for example, housing, you see the effects. Your second question, though, really, I think, is important. And that is a lot of this has come through a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market.

I would point to the interest sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it's a joint story. It's a complicated story. But how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy? Would you say relatives of the neutral rate? It's, so I think it's, of course, you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision. But if you, a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate 5.3 percent, let's say, and subtract sort of a forward measure of inflation. If you do that, there are many, many ways to calculate that neutral rate. But that's what I like to do. And you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate, you will.

I would look at it this way, though. The economy is broadly normalizing. And so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens. It's probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that's OK. That's OK. But we do see. You saw today's ECI reading.

So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically. I think the labor market is, I don't know if it's rebalancing. Clearly, there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened, you remember, in 2021, you had a severe labor shortage. It was everywhere panic on a part of businesses couldn't find people. So what's happened is we expected the labor market to come back quickly, and it didn't. In 2022, was a disappointing year. And we were kind of thinking, well, maybe we won't get it back.

Of course, if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would, we would have to respond to that. That would be a surprise at this point, but I have to tell you, that's why we keep our options open here, and why we're not rushing. So I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is you've had six good months, very good months. But what's really going to shake out here?

And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? So how to disagree, your first question, how to describe where we are. So I guess I would just say this. If summary would be, growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market, 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4%. That hasn't happened in 50 years. So it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come.

Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn't happened. But we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. Labor market is rebalancing, as I mentioned. Job creation has slowed the base of job growth has narrowed. And of course, 12-month inflation is above target and getting down closer to target. It's not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and questions we have to answer. But overall, it's a pretty good picture. It is a good picture. Your second question was sorry. Could you get inflation that is below target, end up with inflation below target, and you have to do something about that?

So I'm not seeing why it would, but, you know, right now, I would say the productivity is kind of what falls out of the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and activity returning and supply chain is getting fixed.

I'm wondering how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates. And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. So when we think about our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability and that's what we're targeting. We're not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing or any of those things. Those are very important things for people's lives, but they're not, you know, those are not the things we're targeting. We're also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing industry was helped more than any other industry.

We have a built up set of cities and people moving further and further out so that there hasn't been enough housing built. And these are not things that we have any tools to address. But where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. It's really rental inflation. You're taking owners equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants. And you're running that through the CPI calculation or the PCE calculation, the one we look at. And what that's telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time it has to as long as that remains the case.

So those questions are all coming into scope now and we're focusing on them but we're at the beginning of that process, I would say. Quick follow-up, is the case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem? Yes, we do see those as independent tools and so they don't, for example, if you're normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet.

We're setting policy based on the totality of the data. But just to follow, if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive, would that mean you'd have to trim more perhaps than you already have factored in? I think if we came to the view that the six month inflation numbers which are very close to two were in PCE world, if we thought that is really where we're going to be, then yes, our policy would be in a different place.

Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might that you're in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong and you're more tilted towards that. And also perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point? I'm not so worried about that.
