2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:31:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2% longer run goal. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2% goal. To that end today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Through more support.",-6.661546391650001e-05,0.00034521445022423267

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and entangial bulls has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median projection of about 2 percent over the next few years. In the labor market, conditions remain solid. Pay-roll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year.",1.6994036298400016e-05,0.00027260111023010394

The unemployment rate is higher than it was a year ago, but at 4.2% in November it has remained low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4.2% at the end of this year and 4.3% over the next few years. Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years, but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2% longer run goal. The consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.5%.",-6.609002296414689e-05,0.00023126352478647168

Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SCP for total PCE inflation is 2.4% this year, and 2.5% next year, somewhat higher than projected in September. Thereafter the median projection falls to our 2% objective. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate. And today's meeting, the Committee decides.",-8.18168499292784e-09,0.00019818986589153158

We've been moving policy toward a more neutral setting in order to maintain the straight of the economy and the labor market while establishing further progress and sorry enabling further progress on inflation. With today's action, we have lowered our policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak, and our policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.",-3.303273408988551e-05,9.90818416012602e-05

In our summary of economic projections, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to meet the most likely scenario going forward. The median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 3.9% at the end of next year, and 3.4% at the end of 2026. These median projections are somewhat higher than in September, consistent with the firmer inflation projection. These projections, however, are not a committee plan or decision. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. If the economy remains strong, inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2%. We can dial back policy restraint more slowly.

Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. On a technical note, we lowered the offering rate on our overnight reverse repot facility to align it with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate. It's typical configuration. All adjustments of this kind have no bearing on the stance of monetary policy. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal, and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country.

Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Gina Spiralic with the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about why officials think it's appropriate to cut rates at all in 2025 if inflation is expected to remain firm throughout the year and what would you expect at this point the timing might look like would a January cut potentially be possible or does it pause next month seem more likely? Well so let me start by saying why we cut today and then moved to 2025 so I would say today was a was a closer call that we decided it was the right call because we thought it was the best decision to foster achievement of both of our goals maximum employment and price stability. We see the risk.,-3.3029052969784075e-05,0.0001321156672667596

So we're trying to steer between those two risks. And on balance, we decided to go ahead with a further cut. And I'll give you some details on why. Downside risks to the labor market do appear to have diminished, but the labor market is now looser than pre-pandemic and it's clearly still cooling further, so far in a gradual and orderly way. We don't think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%. Job creation is now well below the level or certainly below the level that would hold unemployment constant. The job finding rate is low and declining and other measures such as surveys of workers and businesses, quits, things like that, broadly show a much cooler labor market than there was that we had in 2019. It's still quite gradually cooling. So we keep an eye on that.",-0.00013212753086404335,0.00014863994450780663
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:39:00,2024-12-18 18:40:00," the story is still broadly on track and I'll tell you why. We've made a great deal of progress. 12-month core inflation, as I mentioned, through November, is estimated at 2.8% down from a high of 5.6%. But 12-month inflation has actually been moving sideways as we are lapping the very low readings of late last year. Housing services inflation actually is steadily coming down now, albeit at a slower pace than we might like, but it has now come down substantially and is making progress slower than hoped. And we've had recent high readings from non-market services and some bumpiness for good. So I'll just say, we, so remember that we couple this decision today with the extent and timing language in the post-meeting statement that signals that we are at or near a point at which it will be appropriate to slow the pace of further adjustments. You ask about 2025. I think that the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects.",0.00014862084912526866,0.000289088956801775

You saw in the SCP that risks and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we see ourselves as still on track to continue to cut. I think the actual cuts that we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today. We're going to react to data that's just a general sense of what the committee thinks is likely to be appropriate. Sorry, just one quick follow-up. Why, I guess, would you make those cuts? Like what would be the trigger to cut? So we're to cut further after this point. I would say this way we've reduced our policy right now by 100 basis points. We're significantly closer to neutral. At 4.3% and change we believe policy is still meaningfully restrictive. But as for additional cuts we're going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market. And as long as the economy in the labor market.",6.607420132803136e-05,9.911948854334896e-05

And all of that is reflected to your question in December, SCP, which shows a median forecast of, I'm down two cuts next year compared to four in September. Power sign with winners and thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. So this does seem to be the dynamic in 2016 during the last transition to a Trump administration where the committee saw slightly tighter policy in part and expected anticipation of the fiscal policy stance that was seen evolving over the year. Some of it was a data mark to market exercise and some of it was anticipation of fiscal. What's the split on this one? How much of this was accounting for inflation data that was coming in and how much of it is expecting that there will be inflationary fiscal policy next year? I'd say I'd point to five or six things and let me start by saying that.",-4.95605630081385e-05,0.00019824225203199058

Let's remember that the economy is growing 2.5 percent this year. That inflation has come down by 50 percent to 2, from 5.6 percent to 2.6 percent. Headline inflation is 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis. We're actually in a really good starting place here. But since, you know, so what's really driving the slower rate cut path? First thing is growth is stronger, right? The economy grew faster in the second half of 2024 so far than we had expected, and is expected to be above our expectations in September next year as well. Unemployment is lower, and you know, in the SEP, you'll see that participants think that the downside risks are less and uncertainty is less. So that's more strength, right? The inflation is higher, as we talked about. Inflation is higher this year. It's also higher in the forecast next year. I'd also...",-4.95654757500525e-05,0.000165223712907314

And but then getting to your point, there's also, there's uncertainty. Uncertainly, around inflation, I pointed out is actually higher. It's also, in the case of some people, some people, the way I would say it is this, some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecast at this meeting and said so in the meeting. Some people said they didn't do so and some people didn't say whether they did or not. So we have people making a bunch of different approaches to that. But some did identify policy uncertainty as one of the reasons for their writing down more uncertainty around inflation.

He just slowed down and so that may have affected some of the people. But as I said, there's a range of approaches on the committee. If I could follow up on that, you mentioned the risk and uncertainty indexes toward the back of the document. The upside risk to inflation jumped quite substantially. The only thing really that's happened, you mentioned that the disinflationary story remains intact, yet the risk waiting has jumped to the upside. The only real thing that's happened is November 5th in the meantime. Is it fair to say that that's what's driving the higher sense of upside risk on inflation? Actually, that's not the only thing that's happened. What's happened is that our forecast for inflation for this year, I think, are five tenths higher than they were in September. So you've got, you had two months of higher inflation in September and October. As I mentioned, November is back on track.

So that is certainly a large factor in people's thinking. I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor is inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations. It's still going to be between two and a half and three. It's way below where it was but we really want to see progress on inflation as I mentioned as we think about further cuts we're going to be looking for progress on inflation. We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation as the 12-month window moves. That's in part because inflation was very, very low measured in the fourth quarter of 2023 and nonetheless as we go forward we're going to want to be seeing further progress on bringing inflation down and keeping us all labor market.

Could you comment on if that analysis remains effective and any other thinking on tariffs generally that you can share? So I do think that the September 2018, the September 2018 Teal Book alternative simulations are a good place to start. I happen to have brought them here with me today. I'm sure you have them too. There are good starting point. And I would just say it's six years old analysis, but nonetheless, this is still, I think, the right questions to ask. And there were two simulations. One was seeing through, one was not. And I'd point you, there's some language in the see-through pair, if it says, that considers situations in which it might be appropriate to see through inflation and then name some conditions in which it might not be. In any case, this is not a question that's in front of us right now. We will.",0.0002643459294893953,0.00013218115427180945

What the committee is doing now is discussing pathways and understanding that again, the ways in which tariff driven inflation can affect, tariffs can affect inflation in the economy and how to think about that. So we've done a bit of good bit of work all of us have, each of us has. And it puts us in position when we finally do see what the actual policies are to be to make a more careful, thoughtful assessment of what might be the appropriate policy response. Great, and there's a quick follow. Do you, given the recent bout of inflation that we've been through with consumers seeing how prices can rise and businesses being, seeing that they can raise prices at least for some time, does that make it a little bit riskier to look through tariffs? I mean, are inflated, do you feel you have to respond more quickly to inflation threats? Are given what we've seen.",-0.00019830992936450002,0.0003758886047925009

The main thing is, and this is also a point in these alternative simulations, is there are just many, many factors that go into what how much tariffs will even go into consumer inflation, how persistent will that be. So we just don't know really very much at all about the actual policies. So it's very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don't know what will be tariffed from what countries for how long, in what size. We don't know whether they'll be retaliatory tariffs. We don't know what the transmission of any of that will be into consumer prices. To your point as well, I wouldn't say that we know whether the last episode is or is not a good model for what happened. You pointed out we've just been through a period of high inflation. We've just gotten through that period. That's a difference. There was also quite a bit of diversion of trade away from China to other countries since that.",-0.00033029026046289996,0.0001734161326551136

But only when we've actually seen what the policies are and how they're implemented. And we're just not at that stage. We're at the stage of doing what other forecasters are doing, which is kind of thinking about these questions, but not trying to get to different advanceers for some time. Nick. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, to make sure I understand, participants today revised up their core PCE inflation projection for 25, so that the central tendency runs from 2.5 to 2.7%. And as Howard noted earlier, most of the committee sees the risks to those projections to the upside. So if inflation only declines next year from 2.8 to 2.5 to 2.7, what would compel the committee to be cutting in that situation? Let me find these numbers.",0.00018164704268679583,0.00024775779198270807
2024-12-18 18:30:00,2024-12-18 18:50:00,2024-12-18 18:51:00," So we have, we have, we have inflation coming down, core inflation coming down to two and a half next year. That's, that'd be a significant progress. You see a slower path. I think that does take on board that we want to see real progress, but we, you know, we'd be seeing meaningful progress to get inflation down to that level. That wouldn't be all the way to 2% but that would be, it would be, you know, better than this year. This year will be 28 or 29. That would be meaningful. We also have to think about the, you know, the labor market. And while we have the labor market forecast as being in good shape, we are also mindful that it is still out there very gradually cooling so far in an orderly gradual way. But it's also something we need to keep our eye on. I guess if I could follow up.

And they said, gee, this looks like it could be the last rate cut for some time. Would they be mistaken to infer that? So that's not the decision that we made at all. Let me explain extent and timing. So the sense of that wording is to make clear that if the economy does evolve about it as anticipated, we're at a point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of rate cuts. So extent that just relates to how much further we can reduce our policy rate consistent with getting to a neutral stance. Clearly that distance has shrunk by 100 basis points. So it's significantly smaller. So that's the extent question. And again, we're going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as a strong labor market to make those cuts. Timing just suggests, again, that we're at a place where we, assuming the economy develops as expected, we're at or near a level that will make it appropriate to slow the pace of adjustments.",-0.00026424824513257545,0.0001486546751895873

And I just would emphasize the uncertainty, which is just a function of the fact that we expect significant policy changes. There's nothing really unusual about that. I think we need to see what they are and see what the effects they will have. We'll have a much clearer picture, I think, when that happens. Mike. Mike, I'm a key from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Even though you've cut rates by 100 basis points this year, we haven't seen much change in mortgages, auto loan rates or credit card rates. You say you're significantly restrictive. Are you running a risk that the markets are fighting against you and the economy could be more at risk of a slowdown than you anticipate? So...",0.0003716268019152,0.000313862825426095

And they're affected, they are affected to some extent by Fed policy, but they're also affected by many other things. And longer rates have actually gone up quite a bit since September, as you well know. And those are the things that drive, for example, mortgage rates more than short term rates do. So we look at that, but we look at all financial conditions and then we look at what's happening in the economy. So what we see happening in the economy, again, is most forecasters have been calling for a slow down in growth for a very long time and it keeps not happening. So we're now well into another year of growth that looks like it might be 2.5%. Third and third quarters were right about at the same level. So the US economy is just performing very, very well, substantially better than our global peer group.

We have to stay on task, though, and continue to have restrictive policies so that we can get inflation down to 2%. We're also going to be looking out for the labor market. We want to keep the labor market pretty close to where it is. We're pretty close to estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. Job creation is a little below the level that would keep it there, but nonetheless close. And so that's what our policy is trying to achieve. If I could follow up by asking about your formulation for beginning rate cuts included the phrase we need to have confidence that inflation is moving down towards our target. Given the fact that you've raised your forecast for next year, do you have confidence or are you uncertain about the path of inflation going forward? Confidence was our test for raising rates.

So I would say I'm confident that inflation has come down a great deal and I'm confident in the story about why it's come down and why that portans well and I'll tell you why. Again, you do see with housing services inflation, which is one that we've really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily at a slower pace than we thought two years ago but it's not unless steadily coming down as a market rents, market rents to equilibrate better with new leases that turn over, not new towns but new leases, market rents is new leases. So that's happening, that process is ongoing pretty much as we expect.

But we think overall that should generally be in the range it was in, that that leaves non-housing services. And market-based non-housing services are in good shape. It's non-market services. And those are services that are imputed rather than measured directly. And they don't, we think they don't really tell us much about the, you know, about tightness in the economy. They don't really reflect that. I mean, a good example is financial services, which has really done off of asset prices. And that just, you know, that's how that inflation works. So the overall picture, the story of why inflation should be coming down is still intact. In particular, it's a labor market. Look at the labor market. It is, it is cooler by so many measures now. Modestly cooler than it was in 2019. A year when inflation was well under 2%. So it's not a source of inflationary pressures.

But overall, you're not getting inflationary impulses of any significance from the labor market. So what's the story? The story is still just we're unwinding from these large shocks that the economy got in 2021 and 22 in, for example, housing services and now also in insurance in particular, where costs went up and those are now being reflected later in housing insurance. It's real inflation, but it doesn't pretend persistently high inflation. So we and most other forecasters still feel that we're on track to, you know, to get down to 2%. It might take another year or two from here, but I'm confident that that's the path we're on. And, you know, our policy will do everything it can to assure that that is the case. Colby.

Hiring has also narrowed to just a handful of sectors. But now the committee appears comfortable skipping cuts at upcoming meetings. So what has changed about the committee's assessment of the risks confronting the labor market? Is there just less concern now on that front? Or is it just about there being more upside risk to inflation that now needs to be accounted for? The unemployment rate is now the same as it was in July 4.2 percent. It's moved up and down, but it's now the same as July. And job creation is lower than it has been, but it's been steady. It's not declining. It's in steady at a level which, as I pointed out a couple of times, is actually below the level that would hold the unemployment rate constant, but it's not so far below.

So gradually declining, we don't have that kind of precision in this. So you're right though and I read out some of the reasons. We do think the labor market is still cooling by many measures and we're watching that closely. It's not cooling in a quick or in a way that really raises concerns. I think you pointed out, participants in the FOMC really thought that the risks and uncertainty had improved relative to the labor market and it's because things have just gotten a little bit better. It doesn't in the unemployment rate flat and things like that and nonetheless, you know, we're watching it closely.

You know, if you had a situation where inflation is moving around by a tenth every few months, that's, you know, we'd have to weigh that against the fact that inflation has, in recent months, been moving sideways in the 12 month window. And so we've got a way on both at this point. You know, for a while there, we were only really focused mainly focused on inflation. We've now gotten to a place where the risks of the two are, or we think are broadly, roughly in balance. And so that's how we think about it. Steve.

We still think where we are is meaningfully restrictive. And I think from this point forward, it's appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation. We've done a lot to support economic activity by cutting 100 basis points. And that's a good thing. I think I support the decision and I think it was the right decision to make. I think from now, we are in a place where the risks really aren't balanced and we need to see progress on inflation. And that's how we're thinking about it. So it is kind of a new thing.

For example, cars being up maybe because of the hurricanes, eggs because of the AV and flu, that kind of stuff. And then looking forward perhaps to housing inflation coming down as it did in the recent report. So we always try to be careful about not throwing out the numbers we don't like. Anyway, that's just a occupational hazard is to look. Those high months are wrong. What about the low months? We've got, we have a very low month potentially in November. It's estimated by many to be in the mid teens for core PCE. So that could be idiosyncratically low. We try to look at not just a couple or three months. Our position shouldn't change based on two or three months of good or bad data. We have a long string now of inflation coming down gradually over time.

Chair Powell, Neil Irwin from Axios. Financial markets have been very buoyant really all year. Is the committee comfortable with where financial conditions are, or do you see a risk that looseness in financial conditions could undermine progress on your inflation target? So we do look carefully at financial conditions, of course, that's part of what we do. But we really look carefully at is the performance of our goal variables and how are we affecting the economy. So what we've seen over the course of just take the last year, we've seen inflation, over the last couple of years come down a lot, we've seen the labor market cool off quite a bit, that suggests that our policy is restrictive.

Housing activity is very low and that's partly significantly because of our policy. So we think our policy is working, it's transmitting, and it's having the effects on our goal variables that we would want. You know, a lot of things move financial conditions around, as you know, and we don't really control those, but I'd say we see the effects we're hoping to see on the goal variables and the places where we'd expect to see it. So if I may speaking of assets that have been buoyant, do you see any value or benefits in the US government building a reserve of Bitcoin?

If you're confident that we've avoided the recession that forecasters were predicting as inevitable a couple years ago. I think it's pretty clear we've avoided a recession. I think growth this year has been solid. It really has PDFP private domestic final purchases which we think is the best indicator of private demand is looking to come in around 3% this year. This is a really good number. Again the US economy has just been remarkable. And when we, in these international meetings that I attend this has been the story. Is that how well the US is doing.

However, employment rates have fallen rather quickly that prime age employment rate is fell by about half a point, half a percent rather recently. The question I guess is do you think there's maybe more downside momentum in the labor market than the unemployment rate alone is signaling? I don't think so. No, I think overall if you look at it, prime age participation is still very high. What's going on in the labor market is that the hiring rate is low. So if you if you have a job, you're doing very well and layoffs are very low, right? So people are not losing their jobs in large numbers, unusually large numbers. If you are looking for a job though, the hiring rate is low and that's a signal of of lower demand and it has come down.

Again, not something we need to see to get 2 percent inflation. And that's part of the reason that explains why we moved ahead today with the action, with an additional cut. But take a step back. The level of unemployment is very low. Again, participation is high. Wages are at a healthy and ever more sustainable level in wage growth. And so the labor market, this is a good labor market, and we want to keep it that way. Thank you, Mary. Thank you, Mary. I'm Oakley from Bloomberg News. I just want to put a finer point on the labor market. Can you keep the labor market this way in the strong position that you have described without further cuts?

We think the risks are roughly in balance as between the two mandates. And we think the labor market is in solid shape. And when I say it's softening or cooling, it's a very gradual process. Job creations are meaningfully positive. Wages are, if anything, a little still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer run trend if you take into account the high productivity readings we've had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2% inflation. So, again, I don't know overstate the downside of the labor market because the downside clearly appear to have diminished. Nonetheless, it's one of our mandate goals.

Why do you think it is that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than you'd expected? You know, it breaks down into a long answer if you want, but it just has been a little bit more stubborn. I think if you go back two or three years, many people were saying that to get this far down, we would have had to have a deeper session and high unemployment by now.

One reason is that just a technical issue around the way we calculate housing services, and that process has been slower than market rents are showing up more slowly in that measure. And we might have thought two years ago. So that's part of it. I think there are other parts of the story. But what I think people are feeling right now is the effect of high prices, not high inflation. So we understand very well that prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that.

So now we have inflation itself is way down, but people are still feeling high prices. And that is really what people are feeling. The best we can do for them, and that's who we work for, is to get inflation back down to its target and keep it there so that people are earning big, real wage increases so that their wages are going up. Their compensation is going up faster than inflation, year upon year upon year, and that's what will restore people's good feeling about the economy. That's what it will take and that's what we're aiming for. And as we look ahead to next year, what do you see as the biggest challenge to the economy under the next administration?

What percent do you see in the committee believes where is that neutral rate? Okay. So I'll say a couple of things. First of all, when we write the thing we write down in the summary of the economic projections is the longer run neutral rate, which is the neutral rate at a time when supply and demand are in balance, the full economies in balance and no shocks are hitting the economy. That is not where we are right now. So when we're making monetary policy at the Fed, that's not the question we're asking. So you can't do a straight read between those longer run numbers that we write down and what we think the appropriate policy should be. So basically at any given time, various shocks are hitting the economy. So what we're doing in real time is we're looking at our policy stance and we're looking at the way it's hitting the economy. And particularly we look at the effects it's having as we try to move the economy toward maximum employment and price stability.",0.0001497077925719084,0.0009321836401770241

And the ones that are permanent are the ones that would be in our star. The ones that could be lasting but not the less go away over time, they could actually affect what's sort of technically the appropriate neutral stance in near term. So we're looking at that and we don't know exactly where it is. But as I like to say, we know it by its works and I think what we know for sure is that we're 100 based points closer to it right now. There are many estimates of where that might be and we know we're a lot closer to it and I think we're in a good place but I think from here it's a new phase and we're going to be cautious about further cuts. But I think that the markets are looking for a little more clarity. I mean I've heard estimates from 2.9% to 4%. I think the markets would like to see a little more clarity about the year out 18 months out as to where that goal post for lack of better term is because at the moment it looks big.",-0.0006819030037956,0.0005158241538819019

There are empirical models, there are theoretical models, there are things that combine them, and they have as many different answers as you'd like. So there is no real certainty. And I mean, it's actually a good thing to know that we don't know exactly where it is. So you're not tempted to think, oh, I think this model or this estimate is right. You just have to be open to the empirical data that are coming in and also how it's affecting the outlook. And it's not made any easier by the fact that our policy works with long and variable legs. Nonetheless, that is the job we have. And so I think we need, it's appropriate for us now to proceed cautiously. Now that we're 100 basis points closer to neutral and we'll do so.

I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were saying at the beginning about inflation. Are you saying that progress on core PCE counts as progress on inflation, even if headline inflation takes up, and then also since that's what's projected in the PCP, I was wondering what accounts for that? Why do you all see core PC going down and potentially headline inflation taking up? As I imagine, you know, the goal overall is headline inflation because that's what people experience. People don't experience core inflation, they experience inflation, and that includes food and energy costs. So that's the overall goal. But as we know, headline inflation contains energy and food, and those prices can fluctuate for reasons that are not related to the economy.",0.0002277776460289,0.0011822692909715196

So it turns out that core inflation is a better predictor of overall inflation than overall inflation is. So we look at core inflation because it's a better measure of what future inflation is like to be, likely to be, because it's a better measure of what inflation pressures exist. So that's complicated, but ultimately our goal is headline, not core. So your second question was what? Why do you all see core going down, but headline potentially taking up? So headline can be affected, you're talking about next year. Yeah, so headline can be affected by energy prices and food prices. So there will be things in the headline forecast that are to do with forecast of energy prices, whereas core will be, if you look at core going out a full year, then it will be much more driven by things like tightness.",0.0006744356358282,0.0005330579200747115

My headline has been lower, as you know, most of this year, that's because the energy prices have been coming down, which is a great thing for people. But energy prices will come down and then they will go up. And it won't really be telling us anything about how tight the economy is and how future inflation will perform. Do geopolitical risks factor in it all to how you're thinking about energy prices? We monitor geopolitical risks really quickly, but really carefully, rather. But I would say so far, those risks haven't really, nothing has come out of those risks that really has really been important for the United States economy. The single thing that you would look to is the price of oil, given that we're talking about the Middle East and Ukraine. But that is a good summary statistic for the kind of thing that could go wrong with global turmoil. But the price of oil has been coming down.

Thanks, Chair Powell. Kelly O'Grady from CBS News. I want to go back to something that you said a minute ago that wage growth is outpacing inflation now. It wasn't the case for some time, of course. It's partly why Americans haven't felt much relief in their wallets from prices yet. But with inflation ticking up, how worried are you, the progress in closing that gap could go away? Yeah, so inflation, again, we don't overreact to a couple of months of higher readings or a couple of months of lower readings. And what we had was, we had four months of really nice readings and then September and October were higher, but then November is much lower.

What the public is feeling, and they're right about it, is that prices are just, the price level went up because of the past inflation. And it's going to take some time for real wages to recover over a period of years in which your real compensation is growing. And in other words, your compensation is growing, meaningfully faster than inflation. That's exactly the kind of economy we have now. And we just want to hold on to it. That process probably takes some years, but that's what's going on right now. And I don't think that, you know, a couple of months of higher inflation really signal that anything of the nature you're suggesting. And just one follow-up. Let's look more long-term.

That's not necessarily progress in the right direction. Are you confident?",0.00018123060281049997,0.0006998600279943329

We're talking about when you're projecting the economy, you know, three years out, two years out, you're talking about high uncertainty, very high uncertainty. You know, we really, at that point, it's not... That's not possible to confidently predict what the economy is going to be in three years. So what we're doing is we're looking at what's happening now. We're kind of projecting that the same kinds of things are happening. So we keep a strong labor market. Housing services inflation comes down. Goods and services, goods and inflation settles down. And, you know, non-market services return to their prior level. All of those things should happen over time. And, you know, those pieces come together. There's every reason to think that they will. The timing of it is highly uncertain. You know, but you're not wrong, though, that, you know, it's been a bit frustrating because the... While we've made progress, it has been slower than we had hoped. Nonetheless, we're still on...",-9.215038243720001e-05,0.000766053823607841

I mean that's a pretty good interim place to be. Jobs not done but I think we're feeling good about where we are and where we're headed. Good and Nancy for the last question. Hi Chair Powell Nancy Marshall Gensner from Marketplace. You said a couple times inflation has been moving sideways you know appears to be settling in around 2.5%. Do you think the Fed is just going to have to settle for that and accept that you're not going to get to your 2% target? No we're not going to settle for that. I think we're you know we certainly have every intention and expectations that we'll get inflation back sustainably to 2%. That is and I am confident we will achieve that.,-0.0003244972884241,0.0009155832265152144

We have made a great deal of progress and we'll continue to do so and get back to 2% inflation. That's what we owe the public and we're committed to achieving it. In that case, can you rule out a rate hike next year? You don't rule things completely in or out in this world that doesn't appear to be a likely outcome. I think we're 4.3% that's meaningfully restrictive and I think it's a well calibrated rate for us to continue to make progress on inflation while keeping a strong labor market. So thank you very much.",-0.0006319541273163999,0.0006653581290130925
