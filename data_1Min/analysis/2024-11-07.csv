2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:31:00, Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state and remains solid. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.1% as of September. We are committed to maintaining our economy's strength by supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to our 2% goal. Today the FOMC decided to take another step in reducing the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point.,0.00038659271945750003,0.000622392679316385
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:31:00,2024-11-07 18:32:00," We continue to be confident that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the economy and the labor market can be maintained, with inflation moving sustainably down to 2%. We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings. I'll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Foreign indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter. Growth of consumer spending has remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has strengthened. In contrast, activity in the housing sector has been weak. Overall, improving supply conditions have supported the strong performance of the US economy over the past year.",3.3457948690229e-05,0.0002691427802448664
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:32:00,2024-11-07 18:33:00," The labor market conditions remain solid. Pay-roll job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, averaging 104,000 per month over the past three months. This figure would have been somewhat higher where not for the effects of labor strikes and hurricanes on employment in October. Regarding the hurricanes, let me extend our sympathies to all the families, businesses, and communities who have been harmed by these devastating storms. The unemployment rate is notably higher than it was a year ago, but has edged down over the past three months and remains low at 4.1% in October. nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.",0.000269323153823771,0.00021870794078061146
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:33:00,2024-11-07 18:34:00," Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years. Total PCE prices rose 2.1% over the 12 months ending in September, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE prices rose 2.7%. Overall inflation has moved much closer to our 2% longer run goal, but core inflation remains somewhat elevated. Our 2% longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as being roughly in balance, and we're attentive to the risks to both sides of our mandate. At today's meeting, the committee decides...",-0.0003032777313777,0.0003028365691980719

This further recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we move toward a more neutral stance over time. We know that reducing policy strength to restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly could undo a weakened economic activity and employment. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals.",0.00014346338199233255,0.000201860480764386
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:35:00,2024-11-07 18:36:00," If the economy remains strong and inflation is not sustainably moving toward 2%, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly, where inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can move more quickly. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy. Maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2% goal and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment.",8.410400636926745e-05,0.0002683242770386651

Given the expectation that the election outcome will produce policies that would meaningfully impact the US economy next year, how is the committee taking these proposals into account for upcoming decisions, including potentially the next one in December? And can you give us any more sense of how proactive or reactive the Fed is prepared to be, to changes in economic policies with the next administration? Sure. So let me say that in the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions. As you know, many, many things affect the economy and anyone who writes down forecasts in their job. We'll tell you that the economy is quite difficult, the forecast looking out past the very near term. Here, we don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don't know what the effects on the economy would be, specifically what...",0.0001008995443367,0.00025231286795622754

We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume. Now just in principle, it's possible that any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time that would matter for our pursuit of our dual mandate goals. So along with countless other factors, forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy and would be taken into account through that channel. Nick. Chair Powell, Nick Timmeros from the Wall Street Journal. Roughly one year ago, when the tenure treasury was flirting with 5% and 30% of your mortgage rates when you were 8%, you noted how higher borrowing costs, if they were sustained, could weigh on economic activity.

Any different from those you identified one year ago when inflation was still meaningfully above your target? So we just say this, we've watched the run-up in bond rates and it's nowhere near where it was of course a year ago. I guess the long-gone rates are well below that level. So we're watching that. Things have been moving around and we'll see where they settle. I think it's too early to really say where they settle. Ultimately I'm sure we've all read these decomposition of what you know and I certainly have but it's not really our job to provide our specific decomposition. I will say though that it appears that the moves are not principally about higher inflation expectations. They're really about a sense of more likely that of stronger growth. It perhaps less than the way of downside risks. So that's what they're about.",-2.303686203276135e-05,0.00015975381096924705

But I would say we're not at that stage right now. It's just something that we're watching. And again, these things don't really have mainly to do with fed policy, but to do with other factors in the economy. If I could follow up. Is the September SEP, are those rate projections still valid? They still seem relevant given where we are now? You know, you get halfway through the cycle between the last set and the next set. I wouldn't want to comment one way or the other. You know, people are, let's talk about the data we've gotten since the last meeting. So in the main, the economic activity data have been stronger than expected. The NIPAA revision was stronger. Certainly the September and Plumber report was stronger. The October report, not stronger, retail sales stronger. So overall, though, I think you take away a sense of...",-0.000563281240595832,0.00011770442736785379

And so overall feeling good about economic activity. So I think we would factor that in. At the same time, we got one inflation report which was, it wasn't terrible, but it was a little higher than expected. So I think really the question is December and you know, by December we'll have more data. I guess one more employment report, two more inflation reports and lots of other data and you know, we'll make a decision as we get to December. Gina Smiley from the New York Times, thanks for taking our question to Chair Powell. When it comes to December, what will you be looking at specifically as you try to make that decision? And then as of the Fed's economic projections in September, you had written down for quarter point interest rate cuts in 2025.",0.0005044130440109059,0.0005721737167183351

We don't fill out an SEP and I can't characterize one that wasn't filled out today. So I can't really speak for exactly where the committee is. I would just say for December we're going to be, again, in every meeting we're gonna be looking at the incoming data and how that affects the outlook. As you know, we're in the process of recalibrating from a fairly restrictive level at 5.33%. After today's move, we're down 75 basis points and we're asking ourselves is that where we need to be? You know that we're trying to steer between the risk of moving too quickly and perhaps undermining our progress on inflation or moving too slowly and allowing the labor market to weaken too much, we're trying to be on a middle path where we can maintain the strength in the labor market and also enable...",-2.523666373629592e-05,0.0002019012366450821

We think that's where we are, but that's the question we're gonna be asking in September and in other meetings. And again, I can't really update you on the committees thinking because we don't fill out an SEP at this meeting. Yeah, totally appreciate that. I guess when it comes to your own thinking, do you think that that a full percentage point of rate cuts in 2025 is a reasonable outlook? Again, we're gonna wait and see how things come in in December. I mean, I, it's just, I would put it this way. We're on a path to a more neutral stance. And that's very much where we're on. That has not changed at all since September. And we're just gonna have to see where the data leads. We have a whole six weeks of data to look at to make that decision in December. Obviously, I'm not ruling it out or in, but I would say, I would say that, you know, again, we didn't update.",0.00010094460322898516,0.000353410410460818

I wanted if you could please elaborate and explain a little bit the two changes in the language of the statement here in the first paragraph when you say inflation has made progress dropping the word further progress and in the second paragraph dropping the sentence at the committee again greater confidence that inflation was progressing towards its 2% goal. Is there any policy substance behind either of those changes in language? Is it meant to open the door to a December pause? Is it meant to communicate anything about the stickiness of core inflation the last three months? Not really no. So let me tell you what we were thinking. So the test of gaining further confidence was our test for the first rate cut. And so we...,-5.888651607020608e-05,0.0002860219395651778

It's brand new forward guidance. What do you mean by it? Are you making it, you're requiring yet further, we have to say yes or no at every meeting, whether we've made further progress. The point is we have gained confidence that we're on a sustainable path than a 2%. So that I would tell you is what that's really all about. It's not meant to send a signal. Neither of those is meant to send a further signal. Saying further progress, it becomes a test. We don't want to be, we don't think it's a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance. There's a fair amount of uncertainty in that, in what I've said, the path that we're on, we do know where the destination is, but we don't know the right pace and we don't know exactly where the destination is. So the point is to find that, to find the right pace and the right destination as we go. And I think there's a fair amount of uncertainty.",0.00016825074745821096,0.00019350984796858258

Steve Lee Smith, CNBC, Mr. Chairman, you talked about higher rates, perhaps from an expectation of higher growth. You didn't talk about it in terms of expectations of higher deficits. Is that something you think might be behind the recent rise in interest rates? And is that our rising deficits are concerned to you? So we know common in fiscal policy. And again, I don't have a lot more to say on what's driving bond yields. In terms of policy changes, though, let me give you a sense of how this works in the ordinary case. Let's say Congress is considering a rewrite of the tax laws, doesn't matter what's in the content. So we would follow that. At a certain point, we'd think we see the outlines.

There's lots and lots of literature on the effects of tax policy changes on various parts of the economy. So we try to get smart on that and then the law actually passes and you know, you start to put it, you probably run an alternative simulation before that happens just to keep people trying to understand it. Then it actually passes, it goes into the model along with a million other things. So you know, we have a very large economy, many things are affecting at a given time. And you know, a law change of some kind would go in there, but it would go in. But it would, you know, it's a process that takes some time. Clearly the legislative process takes a lot of time. And of course, the real question is not the effect of that law. It's all of the policy changes that are happening. What's the net effect?

Thank you, Chris Regaber, an associated press. You mentioned the positive economic data that we've seen since the September meeting, including the revisions to things like savings, higher GDP growth. We saw stock market jump yesterday. That's renewed some of the questions about why, why do many cuts at all in this, with this backdrop? So you're right, as I mentioned, as you mentioned, the latest economic data have been strong and that's of course a great thing and highly welcome. But of course our mandate is maximum for employment and price stability. And we think that even with today's cut policy is still restrictive.

And if you look at our goal variables, the labor market has cooled a great deal from its overheated state of two years ago and is now essentially in balance. It is continuing to cool, albeit at a modest rate, and we don't need further cooling, we don't think to achieve our inflation mandate. So that's the labor market. And inflation has moved down a great deal from its highs of two years ago, and we judged, as I mentioned, that it's on a sustainable path back to 2%. So the job's not done on inflation, but if you look at those two things, we judged in September that it was appropriate to begin to recalibrate our policy stance to reflect this progress, and today's decision is really another step in that process. Overall, as I mentioned, we believe that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, we can maintain strength in the labor market even as our policy stance enables further progress toward our inflation goal.",0.00020163789175890002,0.00020223777273278642

What kind of economic data would lead you to that path? Thank you. So we haven't made any decision like that at all. So we're in the process, as I mentioned, of moving policy down our stance down over time to more neutral level. And as a general matter, as we move ahead, we are prepared to adjust our assessments of the appropriate pace and destination as the outlook evolves. So for example, if we were to see the labor market deteriorating, we'd be prepared to move more quickly. Alternatively, as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we're dialing back restriction. Again, haven't made any decisions about that, but that's certainly possibility. If you can think of it as similar to what we do with asset, with asset runoff with QT.

And so we're thinking about it that way, but it's something that we're just beginning to think about. Thanks, Sherpa. So with the noise and the jobs reports that we've seen, and you look at the Fed's favorite inflation, PC inflation, overall, it's 2.1 percent, very close to the Fed's target, but core inflation is 2.7 percent, and it's been that way since July. So why doesn't this data give fuel to a rate pause for this meeting? Well, so I think if you look at the three and six month, you're quoting the 12 month. So we look at all of them, right? But if you look at the three and six month core PCE, you'll see there are around 2.3 percent. So we look at all of them, and we look at 12 as well.

For example, you know, the last three months of last year, the core PCE readings were very, very low, probably unsustainably low. So that's why you see, that's why forecasts generally see a couple of upticks toward the end of the year. On the other hand, the January reading certainly looks like an example of residual seasonality, so that that we saw last year. So when that falls out of the 12-month calculation in February, we should see a thing down. So we'll literally be a bump up and then down. We understand that. Overall, you see the progress on inflation, and you also look at the economy and you say, what's, what is the inflation story now? Where's it coming from? So I point to a couple of things. One is the non-housing services and goods, which together make up 80% of that of the core PCE index.

What's not is housing services. So let's talk about housing services. Housing services is higher. What's going on there is market rents, newly signed leases are experiencing very low inflation. And what's happening is older leases that are turning over are taking several years to catch up to where market leases are, market rent leases are. So that's just a catch up problem. It's not really reflecting current inflationary pressures. It's reflecting past inflationary pressures. So that's one thing. The other thing is I'd say look at the labor market, not a source of inflationary pressures. Where's it coming from? It's not a very tight economy. What is the story about inflation? You see that catch up inflation also in insurance in several other areas.

So you're quickly trying to get to that neutral rate that you see or do you use forcey that you have some time to get there? Nothing in the economic data suggests that the committee has any need to be in a hurry to get there. We are seeing strong economic activity. We are seeing ongoing strength in the labor market. We're watching that carefully. But we do see maintaining strength there. And so we think that the right way to find neutral, if you will, is carefully, patiently.

And I do so with great respect for your attentiveness to the maximum employment side of the mandate, Chair Powell. So the unemployment rate has been at 4% or higher for six months. One of the broadest measures of unemployment is up about a half a point from a year ago. Compensation gains are sliding back. The quits rate, a signal of labor market dynamism, has been heading down to that bad neighborhood of the 20 teens. So you have put a marker at Jackson Hole saying, any further cooling is unwelcome. It is cooling generally a little bit further. So at what point do we reach what you would describe?",3.3443683469401e-05,0.00021848739495797554
2024-11-07 18:30:00,2024-11-07 18:56:00,2024-11-07 18:57:00," as a shortfall from maximum employment. Thank you. Sure. So on your first question, I'm not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election. On the second one, you know, this is the great question and so when we think about all the time. So I'll just say a couple of things. You know, nothing really surprising here. What we know is that the unemployment rate is low. You also know that it's come down significantly, sorry, moved up significantly from a year or so ago. So we've seen a big change upward and unemployment. Sometimes that has meant bad things so far. It doesn't appear to be, it appears that the, I wouldn't say that the labor market has fully stabilized. Because I do think it's continuing to very gradually cool. But it seems to be in a good place and our policy, of course, is designed to keep it in that good place to maintain the strength in the labor market while also enabling further progress on inflation. You know, you mentioned...",-0.00015126050422989803,0.00018489259421101278

I would characterize it more broadly as normalizing. You mentioned wages. Wages are still running just a bit above where they would need to be consistent with 2% inflation. Less productivity is going to remain at this high level. If we see productivity, more sustainably at these high levels, then that would sustain higher wage gains. So I would say, in fact, you can say it the other way, that wage increases are now consistent with 2% inflation, given current productivity readings. But of course, the lower on productivity readings is, whenever you see high readings, you should assume they're going to revert pretty quickly to the longer term trend. That has always been the case for 50 years. But it may be that wefully少ved day gains.",-0.00016795283721150002,0.00028007531437027896

We're five years into a nice set of productivity readings which are sustained and very healthy. But overall it's a good labor market. We can talk about 20 different data series. We'll be looking at all of them, of course. But we don't want the labor market to soften much from here. We don't think we need that to happen to get inflation back to 2%. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we know with Politico. Some of the President's election advisors have suggested that you should resign. If he asked you to leave, would you go? No. Can you follow up on, do you think that legally he did not require to leave? No. What? That's Michael McEw from...",0.0004811409216798,0.0003361358103016241

You talk a lot about what the data are telling you and how you are dependent on the data, but in terms of forward looking assessments of the economy, what are you hearing from CEOs or other officials around the country? What did you hear today from the regional bank presidents about what companies and consumers think about where the economy is going from here rather than looking backwards? And does that match up with what your forecasts have been and what you think the appropriate policy paths should be? So it's hard to characterize a really interesting set of discussions we had, and of course, you'll see them in the minutes in three weeks. But I would say this. I think the comments from our reserve bank colleagues and from the CEOs that they talked to are pretty constructive on the economy right now, pretty constructive, feeling that the labor market is.",-0.0003633466545037,0.0003195264281991399

Whereas two years ago, it was all they were talking about. So they feel like the labor markets in balance, people feel good about where the economy is. Demand is obviously pretty strong. And you're seeing what, 2.8% growth in the third quarter estimated maybe the years, two and a half. This is a strong economy. It's actually remarkable how well the US economy has been performing with strong growth, a strong labor market inflation coming down. We're really performing better than any of our global peers. And I think that is reflected in what you hear from what I hear people hear from CEOs. I don't get to talk to a lot of CEOs in my job, but I hear what others summarize from those. And of course, I hear the Reserve Bank presidents do a lot of that. And it's pretty constructive overall. Now that's not to say there are areas of cost.",0.0004728511358186,0.002019522046448892

The follow-up, the areas of caution, if there were black clouds on the horizon that you identified as something you're watching, what would they be? I think it's things like clearly geopolitical risks around the world are elevated, and just as clearly they've had relatively little effect on the U.S. economy. Now, that can change through the price of oil or otherwise, but people talk about those as something that's on the horizon all the time. But ultimately, if you look at the U.S. economy, its performance has been very good, and that's what we hear from business people, and expectation that that will continue. If anything, people feel next year, I've heard this from several people that next year could even be stronger than this year. Andrew.",-0.00035533151738912483,0.0008579936407530004

Your predecessor's green span and vulgar spoke up loudly when they thought large budget deficits, endangered financial economic or financial stability. Will you do that too? And right now we're in a period of full employment. We have large budget deficits and debt at historic highs that are end rising. Is that something you'd speak out against? So, you know, I have said many times, no more, no less than what the predecessors you mentioned have said. And what that is is that the US federal government's fiscal path, fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. The level of our debt relative to the economy is not unsustainable. The path is unsustainable. And we see that and you know, you've got a very large deficit at, you're at full employment.",-0.00013450803685517514,0.00048770643436137973

Now I can say that. I don't have oversight. We don't have oversight over fiscal policy. I've said it on many occasions. Just said it again. Okay, thank you. I guess the other way or the question is, to follow up on Victoria's question, do you believe that the president has the power to fire or to moat you and it has the Fed to determine the legality of a president demoting out will any of the other governors with leadership positions? Not permitted under the law. Not what? Not permitted under the law. Thank you. Courtney. Courtney Brown from Axios. In response to Howard's question, you said it wasn't an ideal time to give forward guidance because of the economic uncertainties. Can you lay out what some of those uncertainties are and whether or not includes some of the proposals that the president elect has?",0.0003531288429897,0.0005551536766314637

No, I was not referring to the new administration's policies at all, nor will I today. So what I'm just saying is, as we look ahead, we know, as I mentioned this in my statement that the risks are two-sided. I guess I should start by saying that we think that the economy and we think our policy are both in a very good place, a very good place. But as you look forward, you say, what are the risks? And one risk is that we would move too quickly and find ourselves having moved too quickly and inflation comes back and we lost our chance to get inflation back to 2%. So we have to avoid that risk. And to avoid that risk, that means you want to move carefully. The other risk is that we move too slowly and that we allow the labor market to weaken too much and do unnecessary damage to the labor market and the people's working lives.",-3.382176035569999e-05,0.00033641149854509675

We try to be in the middle and deal with both of the manage, both of those. Again, the idea is to maintain support the strength we have in the labor market and in the economy, but also with somewhat less restrictive but still restrictive policy, enable further progress toward our 2% inflation goal. And so there's, you know, this is a thing we're meeting by meeting we're going to be making our assessment of what the right path is. You know, it's not as important. The precise timing of these things is not as important as the overall arc of them. And the arc of them is to move from where we are now to a sense of neutral, a more neutral policy. We don't know exactly where that is. We only know it by its works. We're pretty sure it's below where we are now. But as we move further, there will be more uncertainty about where that is. And we're going to move carefully.",0.00026919667755470004,0.0007739417188236697

Thank you, Chair Powell, Simon and Minovitch with the economist. I know you don't want to share your decomposition of bond yields, but if you look at the break evins, it is clear that longer term inflation expectations do seem to have risen up at about 2.5% for example, on the five year, that's up half a point from when you cut in September. Do you have any concern at all that longer term inflation expectations are de-anchoring or put another way are anchoring at a slightly higher level? Thanks. So we would be concerned if we saw, if we thought we saw longer term inflation expectations anchoring at a higher level. That's not what we're seeing. We're still seeing between surveys and market readings broadly consistent with, you know, I looked at the five year, five year earlier.",-0.0003432001206864255,0.0007905803195963453

So that's one that's been a traditional one that we look at a lot but overall expectations seem to be and have really have throughout this in a place that's consistent with 2% inflation but you're right to say we watch that very carefully and we will not allow inflation expectations to drift upward but that's really why we reacted so sharply back in 2022 was to avoid that. Kelly. Hi Chair Powell, Kelly O'Grady, CBS News. We just talked about what you've heard from business leaders on the economy but many average Americans are still not feeling the strength of the economy in their wallets so what's your message to them on when they might expect relief?

And we went through the world, went through a global inflation shock, and inflation went up everywhere, and you know, it stays with you because the price level doesn't come back down. So what that takes is it takes some years of real wage gains for people to feel better. And that's what we're trying to create. And I think we're well on the road to creating that. Inflation has come way down the economy is still strong here. Wages are moving up at a sustainable level. So it's just, I think what needs to happen is happening, and for the most part has happened. But it'll be sometime before people regain their confidence and feel that. And we don't tell people how to feel about the economy. We respect completely respect what they're feeling. Those feelings are true, they're accurate. We don't question them. We respect them.

I'm not going to get into any of the political things here today, but thank you. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. What is your plan if we start to see Stagflation? So the whole plan is not to have Stagflation, so we don't have to deal with it. That is actually our plan. It's of course a very difficult thing because anything you do with interest rates will hurt one side or the other either the inflation mandate or the employment mandate.

So not going wood, we've gotten this far without seeing a real weakening in the labor market. We believe we can complete the inflation task while also keeping the labor market strong and that of course is exactly what we're trying to do. Can you rule out an interest rate hike next year? No, I wouldn't rule anything out of him that far away. But that's certainly not our plan. I mean our baseline expectation is that we'll continue to move gradually down towards neutral that the economy will continue to grow at a healthy clip and that the labor market will remain strong if you look at our, that will not change from the September SEP, you know, that is our baseline forecast and short of some exogenous event that will continue to be our forecast for the foreseeable future.

Hi, Chair Powell, Jean Young with M&I Market News. I wanted to go back to a comment that you had made about Americans being quite unhappy about the cumulative price level rises over the past few years, even though now inflation is back on a path to 2%. Would it be appropriate for the Fed to undershoot for a while on its inflation goal under the average inflation targeting regime so people have a chance to catch up? No, that's not the way our framework works. We're aiming for inflation at 2%. We do not think it would be appropriate to deliberately undershoot. And part of the problem there is that low inflation can be a problem too. But that's not part of our framework.
