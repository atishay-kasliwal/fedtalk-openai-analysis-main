2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:30:00,2021-07-28 18:31:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete. Progress in vaccinations and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in activity from depressed levels.",0.0,0.0006835892995488569

Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support. The housing sector remains very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle industry, where worldwide shortages of semiconductors have sharply curtailed production so far this year. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve. Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Nonetheless, the labor market has a ways to go.

Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should weigh in in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.

These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, but as these transitory supply affects a bait, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal. Very low readings from early in the pandemic, as well as the past through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices, also contribute to the increase. Although these base effects and energy effects are receding. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, bottlenecks hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect.

Indicators of long-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer run inflation goal of 2%. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we'd be prepared to adjust the stance of policy. The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the economic outlook remain. Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and the delta strain of the virus is spreading quickly in some areas.

As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. As regards to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time.

They helped preserve financial stability and market functioning early in the pandemic, and since then have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the committee continued to discuss the progress made toward our goals since the committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases might be adjusted, including their pace and composition once economic conditions warrant a change. Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of substantial further progress.

Thank you. Great, thank you. So more detail on substantial further progress. So let's talk about the maximum employment part of that.

That's what we're going to try to do. So what would substantial further progress be? I'd say we have some ground to cover on the labor market side.

You didn't mean you feel like you've reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side. Thank you. So inflation is running well above our 2% objective and has been for a few months and has expected to run, certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it will move back down to our objective. The question whether we've met that objective formally is really one for the committee to make. I can't do that by myself, but it's clear that at this time inflation is actually running above 2%.

In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise and inflation above 2% this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2% for some time.

That would again be a question for the committee, but I would really say the guidance that you're talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff. Right? That's what the guidance is for liftoff. We had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2% and on track to run moderately above 2% for some time. It really isn't relevant now because we're really looking at tapering asset purchases, we're clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It's not something that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of liftoff, which we are not at all at now or near now, that's one we'll ask that question.

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about re-acting. You know, does that affect in effect how you're thinking about tapering? Does it affect how you're thinking about potential lift-off down the road? And if you could just talk a little bit about that. I'm sorry for the first 15 seconds of your question. You froze. Could you say that again? I apologize. Oh, yeah, no, sorry. Yeah, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergencing global growth and the sort of multi-speed recovery we're seeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies. So do you take into account that sort of multi-speed recovery when you're thinking about tapering QE and do you take into account when you're thinking about lift-off? Thanks.

And now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well. So it's a feature of our economy. Now how does it affect our policy? In a couple of ways, potentially, one just is that in general economies and through financial markets and through trade are deeply interconnected now. And so a stronger global economy will lead to more US exports, and that'll help economic activity to the extent that global economy is weak, and the United States is strong, and it'll wind up exporting some of our demand through imports rather than having a lot of exports.

These strains, there's no reason they just can't keep coming, and one more powerful than the next. We don't know that, but that's certainly a plausible outcome. Now, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity, but it is both the right thing to do and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason.

Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again? If you could give us a sense of that, that would be very helpful. Sure, I'd be glad to. So if you look again, if you look at the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected, but essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn't the kind of inflation that's spread broadly across the economy. It's new used and rental cars, it's airplane tickets, it's hotels, and it's a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it that is really about the reopening of the economy. So we look at that and we think that those are temporary things because the supply side will respond.

Now, we don't have any much confidence, let's say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say in the near term that the risks to inflation are probably to the upside. I have some confidence in the medium term that inflation will move back down. Again, it's hard to say when that will be. I will say, though, that inflation is half of our mandate, price stability is half of our mandate, and if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were above significantly, materially, above our goal, and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2%.

So one market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the Fed might eventually over tighten. So my question is, do you think that markets have bought into the central banks new framework and how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns? Well, so in terms of what's been happening in bond markets, I don't think there's a real consensus on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting. We've seen the long-term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real yields which may have been connected to some speculate connected to sentiment around.",0.0,0.0017518713170887965

There was also some decline in inflation and compensation, which is significantly reversed. And there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can't quite explain. So I don't see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the credibility of our framework. If that's really your question, we are committed to achieving 2% average inflation over time. What we said was that in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won't be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We've got seven or eight million people, fewer people at work than we're at work before the pandemic.

Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad-based and likely to be persistent and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that could cause them to rise. So we're monitoring that very carefully and we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Again, I think our framework is pretty well understood and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it's time to think about raising interest rates and how we assess that set of issues.

And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There's research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that. So it's not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they're just going back to their old job. This is about job selection, things like that. There may also be some factors that are holding people back. And this is what surveys say.

That many job openings would typically suggest the tight labor market. Of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it's very hard to hire people.

It was much less than people thought. People who, what's happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated, they're going on with their lives. Secondly, we've kind of learned to live with it. A lot of industries have kind of improvised their way around it, particularly for example, buying a new home. That process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more virtual process. And so they were able to do that. Other industries as well have gone to take out and no contact, things. So that can all, it seems like we've learned to handle this.

Of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects particularly in hospitality and leisure and other entertainment, other areas with a lot of direct contact, a lot of jobs were lost in that because that was a very strong wave that happened in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived. So with Delta, we're just going to have to watch. And with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective, we're not experts on this, but it seems like a good going in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less. There probably won't be significant lockdowns and things like that. But again, those are not decisions for us or others. It's something where we be expert in.

It's also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what, I'm just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn't be hard to imagine that happening. If schools don't open, then caretakers have to stay home and if people don't go back into the labor force and the job growth won't be as strong, those kind of things. So, I don't, it doesn't, it doesn't, again, sitting here today not being able to really know the future. It doesn't seem as though the effects will be very large, but there may be effects and it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months or not.

I'd like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it and and quickly as well you you've talked about vaccines a bit and your colleague and Minneapolis has placed a mandate on fact saving employees coming back to that better reserve bank and I wonder if that's something that you would like to see or expect to see systemwide going forward.

It means that the increases in prices will happen. So there will be inflation, but that the process of inflation will stop so that there won't be further. When we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That's inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it may be, I'm just taking an example, not making an estimate, then you have a price increase, but you don't have an inflation process. Part of that just is that if it doesn't affect longer term inflation expectations, then it's very likely not to affect the process of inflation going forward.

So to the extent people are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something's going up, the question really for inflation really is, does that mean they're going to go up the next year by the same amount? So you're going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process gets going. And that happens because people's expectations about future inflation move up. And we don't think that's happening. There's no evidence that it's happening. All the evidence is that it's not happening. But nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because we have two mandates, maximum employment and price stability. Price stability for us means inflation averaging 2% over time. And so we've got to be very careful about that. But I think it's a good point that it's a term. What it really means is temporary.

Hi, you've been asked a lot previously if the Fed's monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed's regulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed's bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower income household seeking loans, basically is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?

And I think that an under-capitalized banking system, as we've seen, can be a real threat to the economy and mostly to the greatest extent to people at the lower end of the income spectrum. So if you look back at not this crisis, but the previous one, the banking system was under-capitalized. So higher capital requirements are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.

When do you think you'll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we're seeing now? Great. So with inflation, as I mentioned, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation. And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that widely across the whole range of goods and services that are in the economy, we're seeing upward pressure on prices. That's not really what we're seeing. What we're seeing is a handful of things that are really account for the overshoot of inflation.

And those don't, those frankly don't carry significant implications in the long run for the, for inflation or for the American economy. So what I said was we're going to see whether these things, we don't need to see everything do what lumber prices have done. So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. So what we want to see is these other things do they, do they, do the prices flatten out? Do they actually move down? If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time. So they're not contributing to inflation.

This is not that. That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from a very, very strong labor market and a booming economy. That was the kind of inflation. This is something different. This is really driven by the supply side, which is not able to handle this big spike in demand that we're seeing as the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side, just all over the world. You're seeing the same thing, which is it just can't keep up. And their labor shortage is in a lot of places, the same sort of thing. So there's absolutely no sense of panic.

Again, we don't see that now, but we have to be on the alert for it, and people have to understand and believe that we will react if we need to, and we will. But again, it's not my base case.

What can workers generally expect going forward and it doesn't sound like you're concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation? Is that right? So wages have moved up.

And that really is what we call unit labor costs, move up, and which really puts, it move up in a way that is hard for companies to manage, and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it happens gradually, we've seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and put some pressure on margins. In a long expansion, that's been happening late in the expansion. That's not a problem either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.
