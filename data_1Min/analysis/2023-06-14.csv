My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we've continued.",0.0,0.0028574062125541737

We've covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we've come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged, and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Taking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace.

Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect a subdued growth to continue. In our summary of economic projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months payroll job gains averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May at 3.7 percent. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.

While the jobs to workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceed the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1% at the end of this year, and 4.5% at the end of next year. Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2% goal.

My colleagues and I are acutely aware that a high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.

In light of how far we've come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and potential headwinds from credit tightening. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at five to five and a quarter percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. As I noted earlier, nearly all committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we've moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.

For the end of this year, the median projection is a half percentage point higher than in our March projections.

I'm curious what gives you and the committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of cornflation is still so elevated, interest rate sensitive sectors like housing, while they felt the drag of the past Fed actions have started to recover in some regions and financial conditions, you know, most recently we're easing. So I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence. And out of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then in a period of time over which we'd need to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up and we moved very quickly by historical standards. Then last December, after Ford.",0.0,0.0

So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rate steady at this meeting, I would just say it's a continuation of that process. The main issue that we're focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy forming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time. So the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables. Given how far we have come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace. I want to stress one more thing and that is that the committee decision made today was only about this meeting. We didn't make any decision about going forward including what would happen at the next meeting including we did not.",0.0,0.0035850530863630148

We really were focused on what to do at this meeting. So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move? So again we didn't we didn't make a decision about July. I mean of course it came up in the in the meeting from time to time but really the focus was on what to do today. I would say about July two things. One decision hasn't been made to I do expect that it will be a live meeting. Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wish this morning if you could help us understand the narrative here because it feels like there's been a level shift in the in the dots.

According to GDP, you've doubled your estimate of GDP. So what's the narrative here? It seems like it's getting more immaculate rather than more messy. So you're right that the data came in, I would say, consistent with, but on the high side of expectations. So, and if you go back to the former SEP, the last SEP in March, you will see that growth moved up. These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit, unemployment estimates moved down a bit, inflation estimates moved up to bit, and all three of those kind of point in the same direction, which is that perhaps more restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So, although the level, frankly, is pretty good. The level of 5.6 is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the Federal Funds Rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March.

The committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one. It's going to take some time. And I think you go back to the three-part framework for core PCE inflation, which is, we think, as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward. You start with goods. With goods, we need to see continued healing and supply conditions, supply side conditions. They've definitely improved a substantial amount. But if you talk to people in business, they will say it's not back to where it was. So that's one thing and that should enable goods prices to continue. Because inflation to continue to come down over time. In terms of housing services inflation, that's another big piece.

And that's again probably going to come slower than we would affect. That leaves the big sector which is a little more than half part of the core PC inflation. That's non-housing services. And we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there. It's a sector. Very broad and diverse sector. I would say in a number of the parts of that sector the largest cost would be wage costs. It's the service sector so it's heavily labor intensive and I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions which we have seen. We have actually seen, you know, go through a number of indicators suggesting there's been some losing in labor market conditions. We need to see that continue.

Chair Powell what's the value in pausing and signalling future hikes versus just hiking now? I mean not to be flippant but I don't lose weight just by buying a gym membership. I have to actually go to the gym. 16 of your colleagues put down a higher year end 23 rate today. A majority of you think you're going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year so why not just rip off the bandaid and raise rates today.

Okay, so, and I think if you look at the SEP, that is our estimate, our individual, it's really accumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go. I mentioned how we got to those numbers. In terms of speed, it's what I said at the beginning, which is speed was very important last year. As we get closer and closer to the destination, and according to the SEP, we're not so far away from the destination in most people's accounting. It's reasonable, it's common sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting. And so, the committee thought, overall, that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if only slightly, and there are benefits to that. So, that gives us more information to make decisions.

I know you said July is live with only one June employment, and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting. You get the ECI after, you get the senior loan officer survey after, you get some bank earnings at the end of next month. What incremental information will the committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is in fact a skip or longer pause?

And it's really the engine it seems that is driving the economy. So it's really the data. In terms of, we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year. That's how we do it. It's based on our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is. It can actually in reality wind up being lower or higher. And there's really no way to know.

You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into ballots. Is that still the case or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there? And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate? Is the, obviously the current rate, according to the committee, is not sufficiently restrictive? Is it five, six? Is it six, where is this sufficiently restrictive? Thank you.

If you look at the full range of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just aren't seeing a lot of progress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but as you know, we look at core as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going. This officially, so I think what we'd like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That's what we want to see.

Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask further on the lag effects. When you're considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come into effect that would inform your decisions?

It's sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable legs. Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes. So if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off. By the time we had lifted off the two year, which is a pretty good estimate of where policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points. So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where news was in newspapers and not on the wire. So that's different. But it's still the case that what you see is intracensitive spending is affected very, very quickly. So housing and durable goods and things like that.

I can't point to a specific data point. I think we'll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.

You mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see core services X housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months. And as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices, and then we've had some quirks in used car prices. So given that these trends are in place, I guess I'm sort of asking the flip side of Nick's question, why signal additional rate hikes aren't things headed in the direction you need?

Can you give us a little more specifically of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point? Thank you.

People were still at home. They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend, and they spent a lot on goods.",0.001759505573845,0.0

So prices went way up, inflation went way up. That was the origin and it wasn't really particularly about the labor market or wages. But as you moved into through 21 to 22 and now in 23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important, an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the non-housing services sector. Getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with 2% inflation. We actually have seen wages broadly moved down but just did a quite gradual pace. So that's a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with what I would think. Michael McKeefer, Blueburg Radio and Television.

Markets should have an idea of what you're going to do before you go in. You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down. You reiterated that again today and that we get to a point where inflation could be sticky. So I'm wondering as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function, what will you be reacting to time or data? In other words, if nothing much changes, if we're looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November, will you move? Because you've said you feel you need to. Is it time that's going to require additional movement or would it be your reversal in inflation? So I don't want to deal with hypotheticals about different ways data might move out. So we, of course, we don't go out of our way to surprise markets or the public.

I will say that July meeting will be live. And we'll just have to see. I think you'll see the data. You'll hear fed people talking about it and markets will have to make a judgment. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to know what's happening? You know, I think if you look at, if you just look at, I'll just point you to the forecast. So inflation is running. Core PCU's inflation is running at about four and a half a little higher than four and a half percent. And the median F-1C participant thinks it'll go down to 3.9 out of 12 months basis.

What are you looking for to judge whether we're approaching reserve scarcity and is treasury issuance going to affect that? Also are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks? So let me say first of all, on the treasury part of it, if I can talk about that, and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that, of course we've been very focused on that for a couple of months.

At the Fed, we'll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both the reduction in the RFP facility and also in reserves. It's really hard to say at the beginning of this, which will be greater. We are starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated RFP to take up for that matter. We don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year. That's the Treasury part of the answer.

Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about in the past, about unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be 2.8 trillion in 10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be 52 trillion by 2033. At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because I'm assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher level spending? I don't do that. That's really not my job. We hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on monetary policy. And we don't see ourselves as as.",0.0,0.0031365905032281803

I will say and many of my predecessors have said that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path and that needs to be addressed over time but I think trying to get into that with lawmakers would be would be kind of inappropriate given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting. Is there any conversation then about the federal's or financing some of that debt that we're seeing come not a pipe? No under no circumstances. Courtney. Thanks for taking our questions Chair Powell. So looking at the SEP it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly or forecast for GDP this year.

I continue to think in this really hasn't changed that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment that we've seen in so many past instances. It's possible in a way a strong labor market is that gradually cools, could aid that along. It could aid that along. But I guess I want to come back to the main thing, which is simply this. We see the committee, as you can see from the SEP, the committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2 percent and we'll do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent over time.

And you should understand that that is our top priority. Just a quick follow-up on that. I'm just a little confused because you said the committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time. I look at the SCP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the Fed funds rate is lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that? Sure. So, if you look two and three years out with the forecast, first of all, I wouldn't put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they're so highly uncertain.

So it just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point two years out, let's say, should come down just to maintain real rates. And actually, you know, since we're probably going to, we're having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly so for us to get inflation down, that probably means that certainly means that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly. And again, we're talking about a couple years out, I think, as anyone can see, not a single person on the committee wrote down a rate cut this year. Nor do I think it is all likely to be appropriate if you think about it. Inflation has not really moved down. It is not so far reacted much to our existing rate hikes.

Is it consistent with the Fed's maximum employment mandate? Are you worried about that about this rebound? So we are, of course, worried about their longstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across our labor market. That's a factor that we can't really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment, it is for us a broad and inclusive goal. And so we do watch that.

Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the right question on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how we all back up. We haven't quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet, and we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there's not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how that played into today's outcome? I wouldn't say that's, you know, as a factual matter that's correct.

What you see is look at core inflation over the past six months year. You're just not seeing a lot of progress, not the kind of progress we want to see. And that's it's hard to avoid that. And the committee, people in the committee, the median went up significantly so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on a 12 month basis will be 3.9% this year.

Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and given the recent slowdown in course services excluding housing, how far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line? So wages will continue to increase. So what we're talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so I think we've seen some progress, all of the major measures of wages have moved down from extremely elevated, not extremely highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they're moving back down but quite gradually. And we want to see that process continue gradually. With course, it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum.
