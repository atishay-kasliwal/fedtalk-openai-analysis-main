2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:30:00,2021-01-27 18:31:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. Today, my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizeable asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus. A resurgence in recent months in COVID-19 cases has...",0.0,0.0011900669082061425

Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has moderated in recent months, with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing. Household spending on services remains low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality. And household spending on goods has moderated, following earlier large gains. In contrast, the housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates. Business investment and manufacturing production have also picked up. The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due in part to federal stimulus.",0.0,0.0

Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain. As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months. Implement fell by 140,000 in December, as continued gains in many industries were outweighed by significant losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus has weighed further on activity. In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a million jobs, largely from restaurants and bars. The unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.7% in December and participation in the labor market is notably below pre-pandemic levels.",0.00012373481387450004,0.0

The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit. In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics. The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation. Following large declines in the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently. For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft. Overall, on a 12-month basis, inflation remains below our 2% longer run objective.

Sufficiently widespread vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us and return to more normal economic activities. In the meantime, continued observance of social distancing measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible. Social-profiscal policy will help households and businesses weather the downturn, as well as limit lasting damage to the economy that could otherwise impede the recovery. In addition, as we have seen since last summer, the economy has proved more resilient and expected in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses.

Today, we unanimously reaffirmed our statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, as we typically do each January. As we say in that statement, we view maximum employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal. Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2%. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation running persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time, so that inflation averages 2% over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%.

In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month, and of agency mortgage-back securities by at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.

Our guidance is outcome-based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals. Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected path of the balance sheet. Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. We've also taken actions to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy, deploying our emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.

And so we do coordinate through the financial stability oversight council and with other agencies who have responsibility for non-bank supervision. And in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far.

I had a question on fiscal policy. Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support. And I believe we're pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December. We have now have a new new president and new Congress. We have a weekening short-term outlook. Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas? Thank you. So I guess I'd start by saying that the fiscal response that we've seen to this downturn has been strong. And I think we can say now that it's been sustained after the passage of the of the. The most recent act in late December. And that's really a key reason why the recovery is.,0.0,0.0

When we look back on the history of this period, we'll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response. I would add that we're, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery. Something like nine million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That's as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the global financial crisis in the Great Recession. Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed. And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain. So all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the administration and not for the Fed. And these discussions are going on right now. So there's a discussion, as you know, right now around those precise questions and that's appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies.

And hopefully we'll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer run damage to the economy. Our role, assigned by Congress, is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability. So, in a world where almost a year later, we're still 9 million jobs at least, that's one way of counting. It can actually be counted much higher than that. Short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who we're in the labor force. The real unemployment rate is close to 10% if you include people that's the labor force. It's very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2% and averaging 2% over time.

We look at leverage in the non-banking system, which is to say corporates and households. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at across that range of readings, they're each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial stability, vulnerabilities overall are moderate.

So I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that's how we look at it.

There's also the possibility, indeed, it's in some forecasts that as the economy fully reopens, they'll be a burst of spending and that because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over potentially and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.

And the inflation dynamics with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation is very much intact. Those things, they change over time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don't change rapidly. So we think it's very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation.

There are people out there who've lost their jobs. It's essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible. And we want to do everything we can to do that. And that is our primary focus right now. It's too soon to be worried about that. When we come to exit, we have an understanding of how to do that. And we'll do it very carefully.

I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world, look in Western Europe, look at Japan. Around the world, large economies have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals for some time now. That is the broad, global macroeconomic context that we all live in, and we believe that those global forces, which are aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization, those forces are still in effect.

We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over time, but significant time. These things are changing, but they don't change at a rapid rate. I don't believe that they will.

Let's remember that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves, very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital. They've actually had higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here.

So on housing, housing is now the level of the housing activity is at its highest level since before the global financial crisis in some measures. So you've had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the tightness in housing markets, we think, which has led to the significant price increases this year, we think is a passing phenomenon. There was a lot of pent-up demand. There's a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house and they're thinking, either, I need a bigger house or I need another house and a different house or a second house in some cases.

Yeah, I'm just concerned if that's a bubble that you're watching. So we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully. And what's happened in the corporate debt market beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility has been you've seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing, you've seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we expected. There were a lot of downgrades in some defaults at the beginning and those have really slowed down. And by the way, the same is true for bank loans.
