7,Washington CNN —
8,"President-elect Donald Trump remains likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump who requested anonymity to describe private conversations."
9,"The adviser cautioned that Trump could always change his mind, but his present view — and that of Trump’s economic team — is that Powell should remain atop the central bank as it pursues its policy of cutting interest rates. Trump in July told Bloomberg he had intended to keep Powell in his role at least for the duration of his term."
10,"Still, Powell was peppered with questions about his job security during his first post-election press conference Thursday. Powell issued a terse “No” in response to a question about whether he would leave his Fed post before his term is up if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to. Powell later clarified that he believes Trump cannot fire him."
11,"”Not permitted under the law,” Powell said."
12,"Trump appointed Powell, a Republican former private equity executive who served on the central bank’s governing board, to its top spot in 2018."
13,President Joe Biden reappointed him to a second four-year term.
14,"Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs alum who served as economic policy director during Trump’s first administration, is said to want the job, but former Trump officials have said the fact that Cohn resigned in protest over Trump’s steel tariffs makes it highly unlikely he’d get it."
15,"Among the names mentioned by sources in touch with the Trump transition are Kevin Warsh, who served for five years on the bank’s board of governors and advised Trump during his first term; as well as Trump’s former chief economist Kevin Hassett."
16,"In July, before Trump was elected, the Fed chair was asked whether he intended to serve out the remainder of his term, and he said, unequivocally, “Yes.”"
17,"Trump has frequently aired frustrations with Powell and occasionally threatened to remove the Fed chair from his post, which no president has ever done."
18,"Trump has also criticized what he perceives as a lack of transparency by the Fed, which conducts its policy deliberations in private and releases the notes from those discussions weeks later. CNN has reported that Trump aides have suggested he would like real-time release of those minutes and economic reports and for the meetings to be conducted on-camera."
19,Trump’s fraught history with Powell
20,"Trump and Powell clashed several times during his first term, with the president-elect threatening to fire him from the post on several occasions."
21,"In 2018, Trump said he was considering replacing Powell with a new Fed chair after the central bank raised interest rates. A president, however, cannot easily remove a Fed chair once confirmed unless they break the law."
22,"After markets tanked at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman,” adding that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.”"
23,"More recently, Trump also said the Fed chair is among the easiest jobs in the government. “You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘Let’s flip a coin,’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a god,” Trump said last month at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago."

26,"While the Fed chair has the most clout at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, they are not the only official to determine where interest rates should be. At every monetary policy meeting there are 11 other Fed officials who vote on interest rate moves."

37,"Fed is now expected to wrap up its rate-cutting cycle by the middle of next year, leaving the policy rate in the range of 3.75% to 4%, which is significantly above the roughly 2.9% level Fed officials projected as of September, suggested a Reuters report."
38,"What Happened at September Fed meeting? During its September meeting, US Federal Reserve officials cut rates by 50 bps for the first time since the pandemic. Further, the Fed officials indicated that they expect the interest rate to decrease by another 50 basis points by the end of this year, followed by a full 1% reduction in 2025, and a final 0.5% cut in 2026, bringing the rate to a range of 2.75% to 3.00%."

Economists suggest a rebound in November as disruptions diminish, but inflation remains a significant concern."

90,The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7. Here's what economists expect.
91,What to know about the interest rate cut expected from the Federal Reserve
92,Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
93,Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
94,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September."
95,"The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. That would bring the federal funds rate — the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money — down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level."
96,"With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars."
97,"If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers."
98,"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt, said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. ""For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable."""
99,Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.
100,Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?
101,"Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet."
102,"Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September, noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report."
103,Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025. That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.
104,What time is the Fed rate decision?
105,"The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m."
106,The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.
107,How will the election impact the Fed's decision?
108,The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former President Donald Trump to victory.
109,"Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, Powell has generally shied away from direct commentary on White House administrations. Instead, he has stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics."
110,"Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate."
111,"If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures."
112,How low will rates go in 2024?
113,"The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades."
114,"But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate."
115,"Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz."
116,"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon, he added. ""Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill."""
117,Will mortgage rates drop?
118,"Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%."
119,"Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election."
120,"As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down, noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree."
121,"U.S. stock indexes soared as investors priced in Federal Reserve's prospective rate cut following Donald Trump’s presidential win. The anticipation of economic growth due to Trump's policies spurred market confidence, though inflationary concerns and interest rate trajectories remain closely watched by traders and investors."
122,"In a sensational market rally, U.S. stock indexes soared on Thursday, driven by Donald Trump's successful presidential re-election campaign. Investors anticipated economic growth, banking on Trump's policy stances, while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest-rate decision."
123,"Traders have largely anticipated a 25-basis-point rate cut, but are keenly focused on the central bank's commentary, as it holds implications for future monetary easing. Market enthusiasm was bolstered by potential corporate tax reductions and deregulations under Trump's administration."
124,"Despite soaring optimism, some sectors faced declines following the surge. Financials edged down with prominent losses in JPMorgan Chase, while tech shares like Qualcomm exhibited gains. Meanwhile, rising bond yields and looming inflation concerns suggest a complex economic landscape moving forward."

155,NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are mixed on Thursday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement coming in the afternoon about what it will do with interest rates.
156,"The S&P 500 was up 0.4% in early trading, though momentum slowed sharply from its surge a day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 62 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% higher."
157,"Healthcare services company McKesson helped lead the way and jumped 8.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from strong growth for its pharmaceutical business group, and it raised its forecast for profit this fiscal year."
158,"The market’s main event, though, is coming later in the day. Wall Street’s nearly consensus expectation is that the Fed will cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. The central bank began its rate-cutting campaign in September as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target."
159,"A report on Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits, though the number was what economists expected. A separate preliminary report said U.S. workers improved their productivity during the summer, which can help keep a lid on inflation, but not by quite as much as economists expected."
160,"Trump’s victory may also complicate things for the Fed, and investors are waiting to hear if Chair Jerome Powell will say whether anything will change in its plans."
161,"Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say would drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to interest rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. Expectations for such cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set dozens of records already this year."
162,"On Wall Street, Lyft jumped 28.4% after the ride-hailing app breezed past Wall Street’s sales and profit expectations for the latest quarter."

167,"“I think everybody’s going to be worried about Trump’s tariffs because that’s one of the things in his playbook. And so we’ll have to see how things develop in the early stages of his presidency this time,” said Neil Newman, head of strategy for Astris Advisory Japan."
168,Stocks rallied 2% in Hong Kong and 2.6% in Shanghai rallied after the Chinese government reported exports jumped in October at the fastest pace in more than two years.
169,"Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. That would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy."
170,"But the impact may be less drastic than feared, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report."
171,"“We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months –- any drag from potential Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year,” Huang said."
172,"In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.37% from 4.44% late Wednesday. It gave back some of its surge from the prior day, driven by expectations that Trump’s plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation could lead to bigger economic growth, inflation and U.S. government debt."
173,"Some of the other “Trump trades” that rocketed the day before also lost some of their juice. Bank stocks were lagging the market, a day after soaring to some of the biggest gains on hopes for a stronger economy and lighter regulation. Smaller U.S. stocks also weakened slightly, a day after charging ahead on expectations that Trump’s America-First priorities would benefit them more than the big multinationals in the S&P 500."

299,Wall Street is headed for a higher open Thursday ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision.
300,"My top 10 things to watch Thursday, Nov. 7 1. It's Fed Day. Two days after the election. Wow, what a week. To those who say we don't need another interest rate cut, I say that you have not been listening to companies' post-earnings conference calls. Manufacturing has been weak, and there's a freight recession. 2. Wall Street was extending its Trump victory-fueled rally that took the Dow , the S & P 500 , and the Nasdaq to new heights Wednesday. At least early Thursday, bond yields were lower after jumping on a belief that Donald Trump's policies as president would heat up the economy and risk higher inflation. 3. Guggenheim downgraded solar company Array Technologies to neutral from buy. The analysts cited concerns Trump's stance on energy transition. Array is a competitor of Club name Nextracker . I don't think Trump is against solar and Nextracker has all-American products, which the incoming president should like. 4. Argus and Jefferies downgraded Palantir to hold. I think these analysts are wrong and they're misjudging the Pentagon's new best friend in Trump who favors spending on a strong military. Palantir has lots of military contracts. 5. Stephens raised its Builders FirstSource price target to $200 per share from $178. The analysts kept their overweight buy rating on the building materials company. This is an interesting call because the group got hammered Wednesday on Trump tariffs concerns. 6. KeyBanc raised its Walmart price target by $1 to $88 a share and kept its overweight buy rating. It seems like meaningless a move but the retailing giant, which provides low prices and value, is a winner in a Trump regime. 7. Lyft shares surged more than 20% in response to the ride-hailing company's better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and rosy current quarter bookings guidance. Demand from commuters boosted the results. It's a surprising report after last week's print from Uber, which lacked the upside. 8. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 5.5% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results because of auto and telco and industrial. The semiconductor maker is firing on all cylinders as it has become more than just wireless. 9. Arm Holdings shares were going the other way, down 4%, after the company beat the quarter but failed to raise guidance. I'm not sure why, but the chip designer is perceived as too tied to auto and not enough smartphone growth? I'll ask Arm CEO Rene Haas why at 10 a.m. ET on CNBC. 10. E.l.f. Beauty hiked its full-year sales and earnings outlook after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results, sending shares higher. Still the best house in the worst neighborhood. On the other hand, Coty lowered its comparable sales guidance, and Barclays downgraded the stock to a sell-equivalent rating in response. Analysts said the company is being too aggressive to achieve its targets. Bad sign and terrible category.

302,Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the US central bank; Donald Trump names his new chief of staff. How the day unfolded.
303,"5.09PM – Nov 8, 2024"
304,Thanks very much for reading our live coverage of the US election. Here are the biggest developments of the day:
305,"Trump’s win puts focus on immigration enforcement: Donald Trump recaptured the White House after promising policies that included a militarised, mass deportation of undocumented immigrants – a costly undertaking that would probably face immediate legal and logistic challenges."
306,Donald Trump to ‘rip off band-aid’ in massive tax overhaul: The president-elect is planning to push aggressive taxation cuts and steep tariffs through Congress when he takes office.
307,"Powell ready to defend the Fed against Trump: US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump, saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other officials."
308,Trump calls new chief of staff ‘ice maiden’: The president-elect had mentioned Susie Wiles several times in his victory speech.
309,You can read more in-depth coverage of the election here.
310,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory."
311,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory."
312,"Yet the Fed's future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump's economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed's policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank's interest rate decisions."
313,"The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again."
314,"The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation."
315,"Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting."
316,"The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate."
317,"Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. In what Wall Street has called the “Trump trade,” stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged. Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed."
318,"Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank's preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September."

335,"Inflation has cooled dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%."
336,"The trajectory of inflation could shift in the coming months. Trump's proposals of heightened tariffs and the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants are widely expected to raise consumer prices, experts previously told ABC News."

344,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, a decision that may seem a footnote given the uncertain economic terrain the central bank may soon be navigating under a second Trump administration."
345,Former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s return-to-office victory in Tuesday’s U.S. election and possible GOP control of both houses of Congress puts into play policy changes from tariffs to tax cuts to stifled immigration that could rewrite the outlook for economic growth and inflation Fed policy-makers had expected to face next year.
346,It may take months for the proposals to evolve and work through Congress even under full Republican control.
347,"But bond yields continued their recent rise in the wake of Tuesday’s results, and investors now expect the Fed will end up cutting interest rates less than previously anticipated as they take stock of a new economic regime that may mean higher federal deficits, higher growth, and higher inflation in the short run, and also come with longer-term risks."
348,"“You can see over time, the direction of budget deficits, tariffs … can become a problem” for the Fed to manage, said TSLombard Chief U.S. Economist Steven Blitz."
349,"After having free rein to raise interest rates to fight inflation in a strong economy, the central bank may end up “in second position” keeping up with shifts in trade and global capital flows triggered by administration policies, facing both rising prices and pressure to keep unemployment low, Blitz said."
350,"Trump in his first term was open in calling for low interest rates, eventually branding Fed Chair Jerome Powell an “enemy” because of rate hikes he thought were unnecessarily stifling growth, a turbulent background to a relationship that will be closely watched in coming months."
351,"Trump promoted then-Fed Governor Powell to lead the Fed in 2018, and Powell was reappointed by President Joe Biden to a second term that runs through May 2026, which Powell has said he intends to complete."
352,"The Fed is widely anticipated to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday to a range between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent, a well-broadcast follow-up to the half-point reduction approved in September."
353,"Market confidence in what happens next, however, has begun to weaken, with the Fed now expected to end its cutting cycle as soon as the middle of next year with a policy rate ending in the 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent range."
354,That is a full percentage point above the roughly 2.9 per cent level Fed officials projected as of September.
355,"It is also well above the policy rate that caused Trump to erupt against the Fed in his first term, when the Fed’s benchmark rate peaked at around 2.4 per cent."
356,But monetary policy has been tightened and is being kept tight to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 per cent target – a process of “disinflation” the Fed feels is not yet complete and which Trump may want to see continue given how big a role rising prices played in the campaign.
357,"Yet the impact of Trump’s promised suite of economic policies could be difficult for the central bank to parse if tariffs start to shift global supply patterns with an uncertain impact on prices, growth and jobs, and various tax cuts are rolled out with a similarly hard-to-predict impacts on incomes, consumer demand, and government deficits."
358,"Fed officials ahead of the election noted that they don’t set monetary policy in reaction to proposals from any administration, but take fiscal and regulatory decisions as a “given” and only respond to the economic outcomes those decisions generate."
359,"They’ve been here with Trump before, raising rates in 2018 as his tax cuts led to unexpectedly strong growth and, from the Fed’s perspective, rising inflation risk, and cutting them in 2019 as his tariffs wars dimmed global growth prospects."
360,That won’t make it any easier to predict.
361,"The Fed may cut on Thursday as expected, but “beyond this, the outlook has become murkier with the extent and timing of further cuts hinging on incoming data and Trump’s policy approach in 2025,” Macquarie economists David Doyle and Chinara Azizova wrote on Wednesday."
362,"Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."
363,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."
364,"Yet the Fed’s future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump’s economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary. His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed’s policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank’s interest rate decisions."
365,"The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference. Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again."
366,"The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation."
367,"Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed’s half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting."
368,"The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate."
369,"Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump. In what Wall Street has called the “Trump trade,” stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged. Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed."
370,"Trump’s plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September."
371,"Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump’s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026."
372,"Such an increase would likely upend the future rate cuts the Fed had signaled in September. At that meeting, when the policymakers cut their key rate by an outsize half-point to about 4.9%, the officials said they envisioned two quarter-point rate reductions later in the year — one on Thursday and one in December — and then four additional rate cuts in 2025."
373,"But investors now foresee rate cuts next year as increasingly unlikely. The perceived probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in January of next year fell Wednesday to just 28%, down from 41% on Tuesday and from nearly 70% a month ago, according to futures prices monitored by CME FedWatch."
374,"The jump in borrowing costs for things like mortgages and car loans, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates."
375,"The economy grew at a solid annual rate of just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers — rose strongly in the July-September quarter."
376,"At the same time, companies have reined in hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. But if economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its interest rate cuts."

400,The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises following the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.
401,The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president.
402,"They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down, and not say anything all that new, said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust."
403,"Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one."
404,"Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes."
405,"And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, or those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions."
406,"Fed watchers expect central bank chairman Jerome Powell to forge a consensus around a small cut, following a jumbo-sized reduction of 50 basis points in September."
407,"Powell will then face questions at a press conference about the election outcome, and what it could mean for his tenure as chair as well as the future of central bank policy making."
408,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference on Sept. 18. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS"
409,"Reporters are sure to pepper him with questions on how Trump’s promises of broad tariffs and immigration deportations could impact the economy, the deficit and inflation — and thus the path for monetary policy going forward."
410,"There are concerns that Trump's policies could push up prices and wages, making the Fed's job of getting inflation down to its 2% target more challenging."
411,The Fed chair will likely deflect on the impact of any new administration policies and argue the Fed decided to cut rates again to sustain the strong performance of the US economy as inflation continues to moderate.
412,"Powell will also likely emphasize, as he has all year long, that politics do not factor into the decision making of Fed policymakers."
413,"It is not yet known what the election means for Powell himself. With his term atop the central bank ending in May 2026, the next president will also be able to choose the next face of US monetary policy."
414,"Trump has been clear, in spite of initially elevating Powell to his current perch, that no third term will be in the offing if he wins. And Trump loyalists have already been jockeying for months as a result."
415,"Most of the names include figures who have surrounded Trump for years on economic policy — from former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who was on the shortlist last time, to Kevin Hassett, who worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Trump."

417,"Indian stock indices saw significant declines as investors awaited US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks regarding interest rates.

418,"Indian stock indices declined significantly on Thursday, with both the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty dropping over one percent, as investors anxiously await remarks from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding potential interest rate adjustments."
419,"Amid expectations of a 25 basis point rate cut by the US Fed, investors remained cautious. Dr. V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services noted that President Trump's 'America First' policies could impact inflation and influence Fed decisions, potentially affecting global markets negatively."
420,"Relentless foreign institutional investor outflows further dampened market sentiment, with major Nifty stocks suffering sharp declines. Market analysts highlighted the skepticism prevailing as the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement looms."

424,"The Fed is expected to cut the federal funds rate a quarter-percentage point. Due to cooling inflation and a softening labor market, the Fed already slashed interest rates by a half-percentage point in September."
425,"However, following a decisive election victory by Donald Trump and the Republican party, the Fed may reassess its projections for additional rate adjustments next year. It all depends on the trajectory of the economy in the coming months."

428,Washington CNN —
429,"The Federal Reserve is expected to announce Thursday it is cutting interest rates, a decision that comes just two days after a divisive and historic US presidential election."
430,The central bank is widely expected to move its benchmark interest rate lower by a quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. The move comes as inflation remains on a downward trend while the job market continues to lose momentum.
431,"Investors will be listening closely Thursday afternoon to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his traditional post-meeting press conference for any clues on the pace of future rate cuts, given the policies touted by President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House for a second term."
432,"Recent data shows the US economy remains on solid footing, but the Fed is nonetheless paring back rates because borrowing costs remain at restrictively high levels, according to Fed officials. While that has helped rein in price pressures, it also puts the job market in jeopardy."
433,"Officials lowered rates in September for the first time in more than four years, opting for a large half-point cut instead of the more traditional quarter-point size. Powell said the bold move in September was a sign of the central bank’s commitment to maintaining the labor market’s strength."
434,"With the rate-cutting cycle now in full swing, the Fed is bringing rates on a journey back to the so-called neutral rate of interest — a level of rates that neither stimulates nor dampens the economy, since it seems like America’s economy is in a rare sweet spot where inflation is at bay, with the job market on solid ground. Such a scenario is known as a soft landing, and now the Fed’s job is to maintain that status."
435,"But, despite September’s big rate cut, some officials have said there isn’t any haste to cut rates further."
436,"“I’m not in a rush to get to neutral,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last month at an event in Jackson, Mississippi. “We must get inflation back to our 2% target, and I don’t want us to get to a place where inflation stalls out because we haven’t been restrictive for long enough. So I’m going to be patient.”"
437,"Still, rate cuts are expected to stretch through 2025, even during a Trump presidency, according to economists."
438,"Powell, whose term ends in 2026, will likely be peppered with questions from reporters Thursday on what a second Trump term would mean for the Fed’s thinking on future rate cuts — and its independence as an institution. He will likely not answer those questions directly, economists say."
439,A paradox of weaker hiring and strong spending
440,Fed officials are making sense of mixed signals about the US economy and its direction.
441,"On one hand, there’s evidence that America’s job market has continued to lose momentum in recent months. Job openings, a proxy for labor demand, fell in September back to pre-pandemic levels as the rate of hiring continued to hover at levels not seen since 2014, excluding the steep drop in the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The October jobs report was difficult to interpret because figures were skewed by the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and labor strikes, but it came below expectations, which factored in those disruptions."
442,"On the other hand, Americans have continued to open their wallets, fueling strong economic growth. The US economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, driven by strong consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic output. Businesses also continued to invest in the July-through-September period, according to government data, and the stock market’s epic rally has proven resilient. Major stock indexes reached record highs Wednesday after news of Trump defeating Vice President Kamala Harris."
443,"“The data has given a little bit for everyone,” said Felipe Villarroel, portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management. “But the economy overall is doing well. The labor market just seems to be cooling off at the margins.”"
444,"But the one thing that’s clear is that inflation has continued to ease — now just a hair away from the Fed’s 2% target. The Fed aims to keep inflation at that level “on a sustainable basis,” meaning inflation has to hover closely around 2% for an extended period."
445,The Fed will have to manage Trump and his policies
446,Trump’s election comes with massive implications for the US economy in the coming years — and possibly for the Fed itself.
447,"The former president backs tax cuts, stiff across-the-board tariffs, mass deportations and deregulation, but he hasn’t provided many details on how he plans to carry out those plans. Trump’s agenda has been described as inflationary by many economists, CNN previously reported."
448,The Fed takes into account how the laws and policies enacted by the White House and Capitol Hill affect the US economy. It’s not clear exactly when the Fed will start baking Trump’s proposed policies in to their economic projections. Officials also frequently mention that their decisions on interest rates are guided by economic data.
449,"But since Trump’s economic vision could eventually stoke inflation, that could mean the Fed delivers fewer rate cuts in the coming years."
450,"Another major question for the Fed in a second Trump term is on its decision-making independence, widely regarded by economists and investors as a successful feature of the institution. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump could push for the sitting US president to have a say in the Fed’s decision-making."
451,"When Arthur Burns served as Fed chair in the 1970s, his policy decisions were heavily influenced by then-President Richard Nixon, who pressed the Fed to stimulate the economy even when it was apparent that price pressures were brewing. That capitulation to the sitting president’s wishes, and disregard to economic data, entrenched a painful era of high inflation that lasted from 1965 to 1982, known as “the Great Inflation,” former Fed chair Ben Bernanke wrote in a 2022 book about monetary policy."
452,The Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month to try to ease inflationary pressures.
453,The Federal Reserve is set to cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month on Thursday in an effort to further ease inflationary pressures that have concerned American consumers and played a role in shaping the recent U.S. election results.
454,"The move comes while inflation, which surged to record highs during the pandemic recovery, has shown signs of slowing."
455,"However, President-elect Donald Trump's proposals have raised concerns about potential inflationary pressures, complicating the central bank's decision-making process."
456,"Trump's economic agenda includes widespread tariffs, higher taxes on imports, and large-scale deportations. It is viewed by many analysts while potentially inflationary, which could undermine the Fed's progress in taming inflation."

458,Can Trump Influence Fed Decisions?
459,"The central bank has long defended its autonomy, stressing that decisions on interest rates should be driven by economic data, not political pressure."
460,"However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he believes the Fed should take his economic policies into account."
461,"During his first term, Trump frequently criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in particular when the central bank raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation."
462,"Trump's vocal discontent raises the specter of political interference in monetary policy, a concern that could continue to shape the Fed's actions in the coming years."
463,"While growth remains solid, with the economy expanding at a rate just under three percent over the last six months, other signs are more concerning."
464,"Job growth has shown signs of slowing, and despite robust consumer spending—especially from higher-income households—there are concerns that the economy is nearing a turning point."

466,Why Will Interest Rates Go Down?
467,"Fed officials, including Powell, indicated that the latest rate cuts are designed to support the labor market, yet there is growing uncertainty about whether such moves will continue to yield results if inflation pressures mount again."
468,"With borrowing costs rising on everything from mortgages to car loans, some analysts fear that the Fed's efforts to reduce interest rates may not have the desired affect on consumer behavior if longer-term borrowing costs remain elevated."
469,"Since the Fed's September rate cut, Treasury yields have surged, reflecting investor expectations of stronger economic growth, rising inflation, and potentially larger federal budget deficits under President Donald Trump."
470,"This phenomenon—referred to on Wall Street as the ""Trump trade""—has led to higher borrowing costs, which in turn has dampened the intended effect of the Fed's rate reductions."
471,What Happens if Inflation Rises Again?
472,"Trump's proposed trade policies, including a 10 percent tariff on all imports and additional taxes on Chinese and Mexican goods, could reignite inflation."
473,"Economists estimate that such measures could push inflation back up to 2.75 percent or even 3 percent by mid-2026, according to Goldman Sachs."
474,"This would represent a significant shift, as inflation has been relatively stable at 2.1 percent in recent months, based on the Fed's preferred gauge."
475,"Such an increase would likely alter the Fed's path, making it less likely that the central bank will continue with its rate-cutting cycle."
476,"Markets are increasingly pricing out the possibility of further rate cuts in 2025. As of Wednesday, futures prices suggest only a 28 percent chance of a rate cut in January 2025, a sharp decline from nearly 70 percent a month ago."
477,"The Fed's dilemma is now a balancing act: while the economy shows signs of resilience, including strong consumer spending, there are growing concerns that additional rate cuts could overstimulate the economy, reignite inflation, and potentially undercut the central bank's own policy objectives."
478,"If inflation begins to rise again, the Fed may face increasing pressure to halt or reverse its rate cuts. For now, the central bank will likely proceed with its Thursday rate cut, but how much further it will go in reducing borrowing costs in 2025 remains uncertain."

498,Whether Fed policy-makers opt for a half-percentage-point cut or smaller move remains up in the air ahead of today’s announcement

500,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will lower interest rates for the first time in more than four years as the U.S. central bank starts to reverse the restrictive conditions it imposed to beat back inflation, but whether policy-makers opt for a half-percentage-point cut or smaller move remains up in the air."
501,"Their choice on how they want to kick off a new easing cycle – less than two months before what is expected to be a close U.S. presidential election – likely hinges more on what signal they want to send as they pivot from the highest interest rates in a quarter of a century than about expectations for near-term macroeconomic impact, even as their worries about the job market grow."
502,"A half-percentage-point cut – now given more than a 60 per cent probability in rate futures markets – would signal a commitment to sustaining the current economic expansion and the job growth that goes along with it, something Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said is the top priority now that inflation is approaching the central bank’s 2 per cent target."
503,"A quarter-percentage-point reduction in borrowing costs would be more consistent with how the Fed has begun prior easing cycles outside of any brewing crisis. It would align with the cautious approach policy-makers said they were taking towards rate cuts, and track economic data that has shown the economy slowing but not, seemingly, about to crack."
504,"Recent job growth has come down from the high levels of the COVID-19 era, but remains positive; retail sales and industrial production data released on Tuesday beat expectations; and an Atlanta Fed model that tracks estimates of economic growth based on incoming data shows the economy is expanding at a 3.0 per cent annual rate so far in the third quarter, above the central bank’s estimates of U.S. potential."
505,"“We have never come close to a major tipping point on interest rates without more certainty” about how it would start, Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, wrote on Monday ahead of the start of the Fed’s latest two-day policy meeting. But while a 50-basis-point cut “will no doubt be discussed,” Swonk said, “Powell is unlikely to have the votes.”"
506,"Others argued that after the Fed’s last meeting in July, at which several policy-makers were open to cutting rates at that time, and with investors flocking towards bets on a half-percentage-point cut, doing less would be seen as failing to deliver on Powell’s statement last month that he did not want the labour market to weaken any further."
507,"“The Fed will deliver a 50-basis-point cut to jump-start the easing cycle and will seek … to reassure that it is not behind the curve and strengthen confidence” that the expansion will continue as inflation eases further, Evercore ISI Vice Chairman Krishna Guha wrote, while noting that there could be as many as three dissents, an unusual fracture of Powell’s efforts to operate by consensus."
508,"Regardless of which they choose, policy-makers’ pivot away from restrictive policy over the months ahead should start to lower borrowing costs for households and businesses, bringing down rates on everything from car and credit card loans to corporate bonds and business lines of credit. Indeed, rates on many credit products have been falling in anticipation of the Fed’s shift: Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to a two-year low last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported on Wednesday."
509,"The Fed’s rate decision and new policy statement are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) along with updated economic projections that will show how much lower policy-makers anticipate rates will fall over this year and in 2025. Officials will also update their outlooks for inflation, unemployment and economic growth."
510,The Fed’s benchmark policy rate has been held in the current 5.25 per cent-5.50 per cent range for 14 months. That is longer than three of the last-six Fed “hold” periods but is short of the 15 months that rates sat unchanged before the 2007-2009 financial crisis and even further shy of the 18-month pause during the “Great Moderation” of the late 1990s.
511,"While the rate decision itself is critical, how Powell describes that choice and the outlook for borrowing costs during his post-meeting news conference may be more so. He is due to begin his remarks half an hour after the release of the policy statement and projections."
512,"The Fed’s decision, the tenor of the statement and Powell’s news conference, and the market’s reaction to it, will come roughly seven weeks before the end of a U.S. presidential election campaign that may turn at least partly on voter perceptions about pocketbook issues like food and housing costs."
513,"In the aftermath of the pandemic, a combination of goods scarcity, massive spending, labour shortages, large government deficits, and aggressive corporate pricing drove inflation to a 40-year high in 2022."
514,"While wage growth was also strong and for many workers exceeded the pace of price increases, sentiment was dour for much of the time as the Fed ratcheted up interest rates to try to slow the economy, home mortgage rates rose in response, and banks curbed credit for many types of loans and borrowers."
515,"Inflation by the Fed’s most watched measure is now about a half a percentage point away from the central bank’s target, and expected to come down gradually through the rest of 2024 and next year."
516,"The economy by almost all measures has fared better than expected through it all, with the Fed now expected to shift gears and offer its first clues on Wednesday about how fast and how far it plans to pivot."
517,It will take time for consumers to feel the effects of the inflation-fighting move to be announced today at 2pm ET
518,The Federal Reserve is expected to announce an interest rate cut for the first time in four years at 2pm on Wednesday. It’s that moment that many economists see as the end of an era and the beginning of the end of the central bank’s fight against inflation.
519,"The Fed’s prime rate – used to set the rates on everything from mortgages to car loans – has sat at a 20-year high for the last year, making it more expensive to borrow money."
,This rate cut is a big deal for the economy. But it’ll take some time for American consumers to feel the effects. Here’s what to expect.
,Why is the Fed cutting rates?
,The Fed primarily looks at two things when considering the interest rate: inflation and the labor markets.
,Balancing price increases with unemployment is what the Fed refers to as its “dual mandate” – ensuring that inflation doesn’t get too high and that unemployment stays at a low level.
,"Following years of pandemic-related turmoil in the economy – waves of unemployment followed by massive stimuli from the federal government and various supply chain issues – inflation began to rapidly increase starting in 2022, topping at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed hiked rates 11 times over a period of about a year and a half, from March 2022 until July 2023, the last time it increased rates."
,"Since then, inflation has come down to 2.5% – still above the Fed’s target of 2%, but a significant slowdown since its peak."
,"The labor market has remained strong but has started to cool. Unemployment hit historic lows as prices were increasing, but this year the unemployment rate went up to 4% for the first time since January 2022. Employers also seemed to be adding less jobs to the economy every month, a rapid cooling that had some worried that the country could be heading toward a recession."
,"As the most recent inflation and jobs data seemed to both show cooling, Fed officials started signaling late in the summer that it was time to cut rates."
,"“The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear,” Powell said in August during closely watched remarks."
,When will we start to feel the impacts of the rate cuts?
,"Though the new interest rates will go into effect immediately, it will take a while for any tangible impacts to trickle down into different parts of the economy."
,Perhaps the most immediate impacts were seen before the Fed actually cut rates. The highly responsive and volatile US stock market hit record highs at closing on Monday and Tuesday as investors prepared for the Fed’s rate cut.
,"“The adjustment for consumers in general is less instantaneous than something like market prices. If you’re in trading and securities, you can immediately adjust the price. A lot of [consumer] contracts are longer lasting,” said Anastassia Fedyk, assistant professor of finance at the University of California at Berkley’s Haas school of business. “It takes a while to trickle through the economy.”"
,"Fedyk pointed out that it’s been more than a year since the Fed last raised interest rates, but the impacts are still being seen. The inflation rate was 2.5% in August, down from 3.7% in August 2023, a month after the Fed last raised interest rates."
,"The new interest rate “goes into effect immediately, but in terms of when it trickles through the economy, that can take some time. That’s why we’re continuing to see a cooling down in inflation numbers, even though the Fed has not raised rates for a long time,” Fedyk said."

,Will mortgage rates go down?
,"Yes, but it will happen slowly. The good news for homebuyers is that the average rate already started to fall this year in anticipation of the Fed’s rate cut. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate peaked at 7.79% in 2023 and has now dropped to below 6.5% – still double the rate seen in 2021, but a sign of easing nonetheless."
,"Still, it’ll take some time for interest rates to have a major impact on the housing market."
,"“For existing mortgages, unless people are going to refinance, that’s not going to have an effect, as long as there is demand,” Fedyk said. Even though it will be cheaper for banks to borrow money, “there are a lot of market forces that have to play out there to get those things over to the consumer.”"
,What about other types of loans?
,"Some loans may get cheaper over time, but many depend on other factors, like a person’s credit score."
,"Auto loans track closely to the path of the Fed’s interest rates, but are also influenced by a person’s credit history and the vehicle. Credit card debt, which is already one of the more expensive loans to have, will also get slightly cheaper, though not by much."
,"Most student loans are not affected by interest rates as the vast majority are from the federal government, which has its own interest rates on student loans that are not tied to the Fed."
,Will there be more rate cuts?
,"The Fed likes to move slow and steady. It took 11 meetings for the Fed to get from 0%, the interest rate during the early pandemic, up to a high of 5.5%. Going back down, the Fed will likely not cut rates by more than half a point per meeting."
,But economists say that this meeting marks the beginning of a new era of Fed cuts.
,"“This Fed tends to be fairly cautious, data driven and it’s unlikely that this is going to be a one-off,” Fedyk said. “This likely will be the start of a gradual decline in rates in months of course, so that of course will mean we’re going to continue seeing effects in the future.”"
,"Brent crude futures for November were down 54 cents at $73.16 a barrel at 0810 GMT, while U.S. crude futures for October slid 46 cents to $70.73"
,"Oil fell on Wednesday after two sessions of gains after an industry report showed increasing U.S. crude and fuel inventories, offsetting rising tension in the Middle East and the potentially bullish impact of a U.S. interest rate cut."
,"U.S. crude stocks rose by 1.96 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 13, market sources said on Tuesday citing American Petroleum Institute figures. Gasoline and distillates inventories also increased."
,"Brent crude futures for November were down 54 cents, or 0.7 per cent, at $73.16 a barrel at 0810 GMT. U.S. crude futures for October slid 46 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $70.73."
,"“Crude traded softer after a weekly build in U.S. crude and fuel stocks, reported by the API, helped offset sustained tensions in the Middle East,” Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank told Reuters."
,"Brent has staged a recovery since falling below $70 to its lowest since December 2021 on Sept. 10. It faces resistance at around $75 due to weak global refinery margins that signal sluggish demand, he added."
,"The Federal Reserve is expected to make its first interest rate cut in more than four years at 1800 GMT, with markets pricing a 2/3 probability of a 50 basis point cut."
,"“Probably the uncertainty of the magnitude of the likely Fed rate cut later today is also keeping investors cautious,” said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo."
,Oil found some support from the risk that increased violence in the Middle East could disrupt supply after Israel allegedly attacked militant group Hezbollah with explosive-laden pagers in Lebanon. Hezbollah promised to retaliate against Israel.
,"After Tuesday’s API report, the latest round of official U.S. inventory data from the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration is due out at 1430 GMT."
,"Analysts polled by Reuters estimated on average that crude inventories fell by about 500,000 barrels, while distillate and gasoline stocks increased slightly."
,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift."
,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers."
,"The rate cut, the Fed’s first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed’s move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote."
,"The central bank’s action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed’s 2% target."
,"The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026."
,"In a statement and in a news conference with Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation."
,"“We know it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Powell said. “We’re not saying, ‘mission accomplished’ ... but I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.”"
,"“The U.S. economy is in a good place,” he added, “and our decision today is designed to keep it there.”"
,"Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump’s promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further."
,"Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans’ finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more. Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings."
,"“It’s a step in the right direction,” Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist of MarcoPolicy Perspectives, said of Wednesday’s Fed move."
,"The additional rate cuts it indicated it will make, she said, will “prevent risks from building and the unemployment rate from rising. They are trying to keep the economy in good shape.”"
,"In an updated set of projections, the policymakers collectively envision a faster drop in inflation than they did three months ago but also higher unemployment. They foresee their preferred inflation gauge falling to 2.3% by year’s end, from its current 2.5%, and to 2.1% by the end of 2025. And they now expect the unemployment rate to rise further this year, to 4.4%, from 4.2% now, and to remain there by the end of 2025. That’s above their previous forecasts of 4% for the end of this year and 4.2% for 2025."
,Powell was pressed at his news conference about whether the Fed’s decision to cut its key rate by an unusually large half-point is an acknowledgement that it waited too long to begin reducing borrowing rates.
,"“We don’t think we’re behind,” he replied. “We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. We’re not seeing rising (unemployment) claims, not seeing rising layoffs, not hearing from companies that that’s something that’s going to happen.”"
,He added: “There is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it’s strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs. We don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2%.”
,"On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut since March 2020. (CNN, POOL)"
,"The Fed’s next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week."
,Powell pushed back against any suggestion that the Fed shouldn’t cut rates so close to an election.
,"“We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue,” he said. “It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too. It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public, and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.”"
,"Powell’s characterization of the economy as fundamentally healthy, with inflation under control and employment stable but likely to benefit from rate cuts was an unspoken rebuttal to Trump’s warnings that an economic disaster is near."
,"The Fed’s move Wednesday reverses the inflation-fighting effort it engineered by raising its key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald’s to dangle deals and discounts."
,"The Fed’s decision drew the first dissent from a member of its governing board since 2005. Michelle Bowman, a board member who has expressed concern in the past that inflation had not been fully defeated, said she would have preferred a quarter-point rate cut."
,"But the Fed’s policymakers as a whole appear to recognize that after years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing."
,"At the same time, the officials and many economists have noted that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs."
,"The Fed’s attention now is “preserving the health of the labor market and preventing unnecessary damage to the economy from a pretty restrictive (interest rate) stance,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics."

,The Federal Reserve's impending interest rate cut will make dividend payouts look relatively more attractive.
,"One group of stocks that will shine a bit brighter during the Federal Reserve's interest rate cutting cycle is the payers of hearty dividends. We have a handful of them in the Club's portfolio, led by Best Buy . The cycle is all but guaranteed to begin Wednesday with a traditional quarter percentage point reduction or perhaps a larger half-point move . Under either scenario, dividend-paying stocks stand to gain because their quarterly payouts will start to look relatively more attractive than competing options for income-seeking investors. That includes U.S. government bonds and even money market funds and certificate of deposits. In general, the effect may be most apparent in stocks with substantial and safe dividend yields. Considering the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is about 3.64% Tuesday, yields in the 3% ballpark would qualify as plenty substantial. Basically, we're not talking about Danaher and its 0.39% yield. There are reasons to like Danaher — including cheaper funding for its biotech customers and an improved initial public offering market — but its dividend isn't one of them. And by safe, the focus is on companies with solid balance sheets and cash flows to support the dividend . The five Club stocks with the biggest dividend yields fit the bill: Best Buy, Morgan Stanley , Coterra Energy , Stanley Black & Decker and Wells Fargo . In addition, all five are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio on 2025 estimates that are below the S & P 500's 20.3 multiple. Of course, it's too simplistic to say these five stocks with robust dividends will go up as interest rates fall. Many factors go into stock performance, such as the health of the U.S. economy and management execution. In the case of Coterra, its stock price is subject to the whims of commodity markets. Still, it's worth zooming in on this chunk of the portfolio heading into the Fed's expected first rate cut because their dividends represent a potential tailwind outside of their underlying fundamentals. Best Buy, Stanley Black & Decker and Wells Fargo are the best positioned of the five top-yielding Club stocks. A common thread linking Best Buy and Stanley Black & Decker is their exposure to the housing industry, which should see increased activity due to lower interest rates. The Fed's hiking campaign, which began in March 2022 and eventually brought rates to their highest levels in more than two decades, led to higher mortgage rates and less activity across the housing landscape. The reverse should be true as rates go lower. Best Buy ""is the kind of stock that can fly not just because of its 3.8% yield, which really works when the Fed is cutting, but also because it sells a lot of big white goods [such as refrigerators] that do terrifically when the Fed lowers rates historically,"" Jim Cramer said during the Club's September Monthly Meeting last week. Stanley Black & Decker tools are needed to build new homes are fix existing ones. ""The earnings are going to go up once the Fed starts cutting,"" Jim said, adding that he wants to see a few rate reductions before looking to book profits in the stock. It's up more than 25% since the start of July. BBY WFC,SWK YTD mountain Best Buy's year-to-date stock performance. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, has been wobbly in recent days after a JPMorgan executive's comments on the firm's interest income outlook spooked bank investors, and then regulators hit Wells with an enforcement action on anti-money laundering controls . We still like the stock . ""I think CEO Charlie Scharf has a winning formula for when rates go down. Call me a buyer not a seller down here, especially with that juicy yield,"" Jim said last week, though our strategy this close to the Fed's announcement is to wait for the decision before making a move. Our view on Coterra and Morgan Stanley are more subdued. Coterra has been a difficult stock to own for reasons outside of its control: Oil and natural gas prices have trended down over the past year, and there are no obvious catalysts to spark a reversal. U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude is hovering below $72 a barrel Tuesday, compared with above $91 at this time in 2023. Natural gas is trading below year-ago prices, even though it's off the depressed levels seen between February and late April. The challenge for Morgan Stanley is that its wealth management business has effectively become an anchor on its investment banking business, which is recovering from a freeze brought on by the Fed's rate hikes. ""Morgan Stanley is now in no man's land: Too low to sell, too high to buy,"" Jim said. ""That means wait, which is exactly what we're doing.""

,"Last year, Anna N'Jie-Konte, a certified financial planner, didn't recommend locking in a certificate of deposit, even though many other experts thought rates had peaked."
,"I just don't think that the juice is worth the squeeze right now, given where interest rates are and where they're likely going to be, N'Jie-Konte told CNET in September of 2023."
,"Now, with expectations for a Fed rate cut, banks could start dropping long-term CD rates. N'Jie-Konte, the CEO of Poder Wealth Advisors and CNET Money expert, has changed her mind, but with a caveat. She recommends short and intermediate terms (18 months or less), but not long-term CDs."
,"I never want folks to go past 18 months of CDs, N'Jie-Konte says. That's because you're locking money up for a long period of time with the hope that you won't need it. But then what happens if you find more favorable rates while your money is tied up?"
,"Instead of locking money in a long-term CD, N'Jie-Konte recommends spreading the money across several investing accounts. While they may be more risky, you could get a better long-term return with a 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, for example."
,"If you need to access your money quickly, i.e., for short-term goals and emergency funds, she recommends a high-yield savings account, which can offer solid returns right now. Just keep in mind that those rates are variable instead of fixed, so they are likely to go down with ongoing interest rate cuts over the long term."

,"Investors have been hoping for a larger half-percentage-point cut versus a quarter-point cut. Traders, in recent days, have increased their wager that the central bank will cut by a deeper 50 basis points. Wednesday morning, Fed funds futures were pricing in a better than 60% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points, up from just 15% odds a week ago."
,"“The Fed cutting by 50 basis points is a real possibility,” said Wilmer Stith, bond trader for Wilmington Trust, who just last week thought it was more likely the central bank could cut by 25 basis points. He’s on the fence, though, as to whether it actually happens."

,"Either way, the Fed’s actions will officially mark the termination of the most aggressive inflation-fighting campaign since the 1980s. The rate cut will mark the first in a series of cuts, with intense focus on the Fed’s new interest rate projections, known as the so-called dot plot, for how many rate cuts officials see for the remainder of this year and next."
,Rate debate
,JPMorgan chief economist Michael Feroli is one who believes the Fed needs to cut by a bigger amount.
,"“What the Fed should do is clear: Recalibrate the policy rate 50 basis points lower to adjust for the shifting balance of risks,” said Feroli."
,"As inflation has continued a slow downward descent, officials are turning more attention to the job market, which has weakened, with Fed Chair Jay Powell pledging to do everything to maintain a strong job market."
,"Feroli sees a 50 basis point cut Wednesday, with guidance for two 25 basis point cuts at the last two meetings of the year."
,But former Kansas City Fed president Esther George expects a quarter-point cut with the potential for Powell to lay the groundwork for deeper cuts in subsequent meetings.
,"Who's right? We'll see, of course. But it could take a lot to form a consensus around the FOMC table to vote unanimously for a 50 basis point cut."
,"Some of the committee members, including Fed governor Michelle Bowman, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, and Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker, had indicated that starting with 25 basis points made sense and they weren’t alarmed by the cooling in the labor market."
,Story continues
,"In contrast, in Jackson Hole in late August, Powell struck a dovish stance with comments that indicated he could be in favor of a 50 basis point cut, saying the Fed “will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.” He noted that the Fed does not ""seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions"" and that the current level of the policy rate gives the Fed “ample room” to lower rates in response to any weakening in the job market."

,The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in four years Wednesday and outline the path for future rate cuts.
,The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in four years Wednesday and outline the path for future rate cuts.
,"Investors have been hoping for a larger half-percentage-point cut versus a quarter-point cut. Traders, in recent days, have increased their wager that the central bank will cut by a deeper 50 basis points. Wednesday morning, Fed funds futures were pricing in a better than 60% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points, up from just 15% odds a week ago."
,"“The Fed cutting by 50 basis points is a real possibility,” said Wilmer Stith, bond trader for Wilmington Trust, who just last week thought it was more likely the central bank could cut by 25 basis points. He’s on the fence, though, as to whether it actually happens."

,"Ahead of the blackout period, which started Sept. 7, comments from Fed officials indicated they are more likely to trim their benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. That would mean a new range of 5.0-5.25% from its 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% when their policy meeting concludes this afternoon."

,"Either way, the Fed’s actions will officially mark the termination of the most aggressive inflation-fighting campaign since the 1980s. The rate cut will mark the first in a series of cuts, with intense focus on the Fed’s new interest rate projections, known as the so-called dot plot, for how many rate cuts officials see for the remainder of this year and next."
,Rate debate
,JPMorgan chief economist Michael Feroli is one who believes the Fed needs to cut by a bigger amount.
,"“What the Fed should do is clear: Recalibrate the policy rate 50 basis points lower to adjust for the shifting balance of risks,” said Feroli."
,"As inflation has continued a slow downward descent, officials are turning more attention to the job market, which has weakened, with Fed Chair Jay Powell pledging to do everything to maintain a strong job market."
,Story continues
,"Feroli sees a 50 basis point cut Wednesday, with guidance for two 25 basis point cuts at the last two meetings of the year."
,But former Kansas City Fed president Esther George expects a quarter-point cut with the potential for Powell to lay the groundwork for deeper cuts in subsequent meetings.
,"Who's right? We'll see, of course. But it could take a lot to form a consensus around the FOMC table to vote unanimously for a 50 basis point cut."
,"Some of the committee members, including Fed governor Michelle Bowman, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, and Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker, had indicated that starting with 25 basis points made sense and they weren’t alarmed by the cooling in the labor market."
,"In contrast, in Jackson Hole in late August, Powell struck a dovish stance with comments that indicated he could be in favor of a 50 basis point cut, saying the Fed “will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability.” He noted that the Fed does not ""seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions"" and that the current level of the policy rate gives the Fed “ample room” to lower rates in response to any weakening in the job market."

,"The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates aggressively Wednesday, announcing the first rate cut since March 2020."
,Washington CNN —
,"The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates aggressively Wednesday, announcing the first rate cut since March 2020."
,The half-point move paves the way for lower borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to credit cards.
,"It marks a crucial milestone for the central bank’s historic inflation fight, which kept rates at a bruising 23-year high for more than a year. President Joe Biden acknowledged the Fed’s success at such a critical juncture, saying in a statement on X that “we just reached an important moment.” Meanwhile, stocks seesawed after the decision was announced."
,"The decision to cut by half a point, which wasn’t unanimous, telegraphs to the world that central bankers feel a sense of urgency to provide the US economy with swift relief from elevated borrowing costs, considering there were blaring calls in recent days for the Fed to kick off the rate-cutting cycle with a bang."
,"Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference that the central bank is “not behind” the curve and that the Fed’s decision to cut by half a point is “a sign of our commitment” to not fall behind in responding to the economy’s reality."
,"Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who has frequently expressed worries about lingering price pressures, was the lone dissenter, backing a quarter-point cut instead. That was the first dissent from a Fed governor since 2005."
,"Fed officials also penciled in more rate cuts by year’s end in their latest economic forecasts, compared to the single cut in 2024 that they projected in June. Central bankers also expect unemployment to rise higher this year to 4.4%, up from the current rate of 4.2% as of August."
,"Despite the Fed’s aggressive action on Wednesday, the central bank’s inflation battle, in the face of immense pressure from Wall Street and politicians, seems to be paying off so far: Inflation is substantially below the 40-year highs seen in the summer of 2022 — all without a recession. The momentous progress seen since then isn’t solely due to higher interest rates, but also because of the US economy’s gradual recovery from severe pandemic disruptions."
,"The Fed has indeed walked a fine line in taming price pressures without sacrificing America’s job market, an extremely difficult task because rate hikes function by deliberately cooling the economy. That tool wielded by the Fed is typically described as a sledgehammer, not a scalpel."
,"Still, despite inflation receding, jitters remain, mostly centered around the job market’s future now, rather than the possibility of inflation getting stuck or reigniting. That’s precisely why some called for the Fed to start cutting rates aggressively. The unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year, though from an unusually low point. Economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise, it tends to catch momentum and keep rising."
,"That has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the US economy — a scenario in which inflation is tamed without a sharp increase in unemployment. Such an outcome has only happened once in modern history, in the mid-1990s, so the Fed is within reach of a historic achievement."
,Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest rate decision.
,Powell doesn’t think the Fed is playing catch-up
,"The Fed faced pressure to start cutting rates in July, but did not."
,"Some investors and economists pointed to rising unemployment and how the job market can sometimes take a turn for the worse on a dime. The central bank was still waiting for enough evidence that inflation had come under control, but Powell had said a weakening job market could speed up the timing of the first rate cut."
,"The pace of the job market’s slowdown seems to have done the trick. But it also begs the question: Should the Fed have cut rates in July? Clearly, some investors believe the Fed is behind the curve and the decision to cut rates by half a point fueled that fire even more. It’s a tricky predicament for the Fed, and even the fact that the decision wasn’t unanimous casts even more doubt over the soundness of the Fed’s decision-making."
,"Powell doesn’t agree with that perception. He said the Fed is simply committed to maintaining the labor market’s strength, meaning that officials aren’t trying to put out a fire, but rather shape an insurance policy with their rate cuts. That explanation could appease Wall Street."
,"“When will investors think the Fed is ahead of the curve and proactively exercising its ‘put’? This is the most important question because investors have been implicitly asking that — and hoping for this outcome — all summer long,” Jason Draho, head of asset allocation, CIO Americas, at UBS Financial Services, said in a recent analyst note. He added that the Fed’s commitment to extending the US economy’s expansion is key for investors’ confidence."
,"Powell also said that additional jumbo-sized cuts aren’t necessarily coming down the pike, showing that the Fed perhaps isn’t playing catch-up, saying that “I do not think that anyone should look at that and say, ‘This is the new pace.’“"
,Powell thinks the economy is in good shape
,"The Fed chief was unequivocal in expressing his optimism about the broader US economy and its outlook, including the job market."
,"“The labor market is in solid condition, and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there,” Powell said. “You can say that about the whole economy: The US economy is in good shape. It’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down. The labor market is at a strong pace. We want to keep it there. That’s what we’re doing.”"
,"His characterization squares out with the numbers. Employers have continued to add jobs at a healthy pace and unemployment remains at historically low levels, despite slower momentum recently. But Powell cautioned that the labor market is no longer where it was “on the eve of the pandemic,” which he previously said, but rather that it is “now less tight” than it was in late 2019."
,"The Fed chief underscored the tough balancing act officials are forced to contend with in trying to finish the job dealing with inflation and preventing a deterioration in the job market, which could be hard to remedy."
,The Fed chief addresses the political optics — again
,"Powell is typically asked about perceptions that the Fed’s decision is being driven by politics, especially with the US presidential election coming up. His response is usually along the lines of the Fed being an apolitical agency that makes its decisions based on the story that economic figures tell."
,"Former President Donald Trump has said that if he were elected to a second presidential term he would not reappoint Powell — and would even push to have a greater say in monetary policy. Powell said such a shift would be a bad thing for the soundness of the Fed’s decision-making, in response to a question posed by CNN’s Matt Egan."
,"“Democracies around the world, countries that are like the United States, have independent central banks. And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors, maybe, people in office as opposed to people who are not in office,” Powell said."
,"“We do our work to serve all Americans. We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.”"
,The Federal Reserve is poised to do something it hasn’t done in more than four years: Cut its benchmark interest rate.
,Key points
,"The Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, the first and the biggest cut since March 2020 when COVID-19 was hammering the economy."
,"The cut amounts to a declaration of victory over inflation, which has come down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% last month."
,The Fed signaled that it will cut the rate by another half a percentage point this year and expects four more cuts in 2025 and two in 2026.
,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers."
,"The rate cut, the Fed’s first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed’s move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote."
,"The central bank’s action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed’s 2% target."
,"The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026."
,"In a statement and in a news conference with Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation."
,"“We know it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Powell said. “We’re not saying, ‘mission accomplished’ ... but I have to say, though, we’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.”"
,"“The U.S. economy is in a good place,” he added, “and our decision today is designed to keep it there.”"
,"Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump’s promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further."
,"Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans’ finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more. Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings."
,"“It’s a step in the right direction,” Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said of Wednesday’s Fed move."
,"The additional rate cuts it indicated it will make, she said, will “prevent risks from building and the unemployment rate from rising. They are trying to keep the economy in good shape.”"
,"In an updated set of projections, the policymakers collectively envision a faster drop in inflation than they did three months ago but also higher unemployment. They foresee their preferred inflation gauge falling to 2.3% by year’s end, from its current 2.5%, and to 2.1% by the end of 2025. And they now expect the unemployment rate to rise further this year, to 4.4%, from 4.2% now, and to remain there by the end of 2025. That’s above their previous forecasts of 4% for the end of this year and 4.2% for 2025."
,Powell was pressed at his news conference about whether the Fed’s decision to cut its key rate by an unusually large half-point is an acknowledgement that it waited too long to begin reducing borrowing rates.
,"“We don’t think we’re behind,” he replied. “We think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind. We’re not seeing rising (unemployment) claims, not seeing rising layoffs, not hearing from companies that that’s something that’s going to happen.”"
,He added: “There is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when it’s strong and not when you begin to see the layoffs. We don’t think we need to see further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2%.”
,"The Fed’s next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week."
,Powell pushed back against any suggestion that the Fed shouldn’t cut rates so close to an election.
,"“We’re not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue,” he said. “It’s just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that’s how the other central banks are set up, too. It’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public, and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.”"
,"Powell’s characterization of the economy as fundamentally healthy, with inflation under control and employment stable but likely to benefit from rate cuts was an unspoken rebuttal to Trump’s warnings that an economic disaster is near."
,"The Fed’s move Wednesday reverses the inflation-fighting effort it engineered by raising its key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald’s to dangle deals and discounts."
,"The Fed’s decision drew the first dissent from a member of its governing board since 2005. Michelle Bowman, a board member who has expressed concern in the past that inflation had not been fully defeated, said she would have preferred a quarter-point rate cut."
,"But the Fed’s policymakers as a whole appear to recognize that after years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing."
,"At the same time, the officials and many economists have noted that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs."
,"The Fed’s attention now is “preserving the health of the labor market and preventing unnecessary damage to the economy from a pretty restrictive (interest rate) stance,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics."
