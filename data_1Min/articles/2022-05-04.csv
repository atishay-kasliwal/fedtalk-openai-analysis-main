0,Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 0.5% to slow inflation,2022-05-04T16:32:40Z,"The Federal Reserve is expected to announce that it lifted its core interest rate by as much as 0.5%, its second hike in two months as it works to cool inflation","The Federal Reserve is expected to lift its core interest rate by as much as 0.5 percent on Wednesday — its second hike in two months as the central bank works to fight inflation levels that have reached 40-year highs.
The widely expected move comes as the Fed seeks to cool off a pandemic recovery that has produced stellar job growth, but that has come against a backdrop of soaring prices across a range of goods and services, from gas to real estate. Labor, too, has gotten more expensive, fueling shortages and putting pressure on the Fed to slow companies' expansion plans.
Thanks to prior comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, higher rates have already begun to show up in everyday borrowing transactions for products including homes and autos, according to Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group.
""Where we're more likely to see them [higher rates] show up now in is short-term borrowing costs,"" Faucher said. ""So one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, CD [certificate of deposit] rates may move up a little bit.""
While surging prices have historically come amid sputtering economic growth, many economists see the U.S.'s current financial picture as one that has been able to largely absorb recent leaps in the cost of goods.
Still, there remains some concern that the Fed has fallen behind when it comes to fighting inflation, and that it could end up having to raise rates so aggressively that it ends up tipping the economy into a recession. As economists at Bank of America wrote in a note to investors Monday, markets believe the Fed may have to set the federal funds rate beyond 3 percent to cool down inflation by making it more expensive to borrow. The current core or federal funds rate is now 0.33 percent.
Some economists were encouraged by data Monday that showed a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing activity as one reason why the Fed may not have to be as aggressive in raising rates as some have feared in recent months. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is among those who believe inflation likely peaked in March, meaning the Fed will be able to slow its pace of interest rate hikes.
In a note to clients Monday, Shepherdson also cited ""the rollover in housing demand, the impending steep drop in inflation, and the broad tightening of financial conditions"" as arguments against ""endless"" rate hikes. ""None of this will prevent a 50 [basis point] hike [Wednesday], or likely in June, but we are on the alert for markets to start scaling back their expectations for mid-summer onwards.""
But PNC's Faucher said he believes a recession could still come in the next 24 months or so. He puts the odds that the economy goes into reverse at about 1 in 3.
""The Fed may decide we need to experience a mild recession to bring down wage-inflationary pressures,"" Faucher said. ""But the good news is starting from a very good place in the labor market.""
As a result, Faucher said, job losses are more likely to be concentrated in areas like housing and other durable goods that are interest-rate sensitive, as opposed to services consumption.
Still, he said, the next few years are likely to be turbulent.
""Right now the economy looks good,"" Faucher said. ""We've got good job growth, good consumer spending growth, so we are not in imminent danger of a recession — but the risk is elevated, and even if we don’t get a recession, things are going to be bumpy the next couple of years.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-increase-inflation-rcna26982

The Fed came to the rescue in March 2020 by slashing interest rates to zero and promising to purchase trillions of dollars in bonds. Those moves laid the foundation for blockbuster returns in the stock market, gains that helped revive confidence in the US economy after the onset of Covid-19.

May 4 (UPI) -- President Joe Biden will speak on economic growth, jobs and deficit reduction on Wednesday, just hours before the Federal Reserve is expected to make a significant rate hike to control inflation. The Fed ends its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon and is widely expected by most analysts to make a half-point or three-quarter-point interest rate hike -- a standard move to get a handle on rising prices.

Biden was scheduled to deliver his remarks at 11 a.m. EDT.
The Fed last increased rates in March by a quarter-point for the first time since 2018. That followed two years of rate decreases and emergency actions to counter the COVID-19 crisis.
Earlier Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics reported that the U.S. economy added almost 250,000 private jobs in April, missing expectations by about 130,000 hirings.
Most of the new jobs were created among larger companies and small businesses on the whole lost jobs last month.
The Labor Department will issue its April jobs report on Friday. Most economists expect that survey to show about 385,000 new hirings last month.

U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day May meeting, which almost certainly will bring an aggressive 50 basis point interest rate hike to fight inflation. If the premarket gains were to hold by the close, it would be the third straight positive session for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, the first time that's happened since March. The Dow on Tuesday rose 0.2%. The S&P 500 climbed nearly 0.5%, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.2%.
Monday, the first trading day of May, saw the S&P 500 hit a new 2022 intraday low before Wall Street rallied and closed higher across the board.
For all of April, the Nasdaq had its worst month since October 2008. The Dow and S&P 500 had their worst since March 2020, the month the Covid pandemic was declared.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Wednesday ticked higher but traded below the prior session's push above 3% for a high back to December 2018. The Fed's May meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET and Chairman Jerome Powell holds his typical post-meeting news conference 30 minutes later. Respondents to the May CNBC Fed Survey expect the central bank to hike rates by 50 basis points again next month as it also looks to reduce its balance sheet. Survey respondents also anticipate a recession at the end of the Fed tightening cycle.
The market expects rate increases at the Fed's July, September, November and December meetings of at least 25 basis points, like the move in March, which was the first hike in rates in more than more three years.
ADP said Wednesday morning that U.S. companies added a much weaker-than-expected 247,000 jobs in April, as employers continue to struggle to find workers to fill open positions. The ADP data has not been the greatest indicator of the government's monthly payrolls number, which comes Friday.
3. Lyft, Uber sink after the ride-hailing companies report spotty quarters

Lyft shares sank roughly 27% in Wednesday's premarket, the morning after the ride-hailing company said it would increase spending to attract more drivers, leading to forward guidance that fell short of analyst predictions. First-quarter earnings of 7 cents per share beat estimates for a 7-cent loss. Revenue of $876 million also surpassed estimates. Lyft reported 17.8 million active riders in Q1, narrowly missing estimates and lower then the fourth quarter's 18.73 million. Shares of Uber fell 9% in the premarket after the rides and logistics giant on Wednesday morning reported a better-than-expected increase in revenue during the first quarter to $6.85 billion. The company said it continues to recover from pandemic lows and won't have to put up ""significant"" investments to keep drivers. Uber did report a net loss of $5.9 billion for the first quarter, primarily due to its equity investments.

Moderna sold $5.9 billion of its Covid vaccine in the first quarter, blowing out revenue and profit expectations. The company's shares soared around 4% in premarket trading. The biotech name on Wednesday maintained its full-year guidance of $21 billion in Covid vaccine sales. CEO Stephane Bancel said he expects Moderna to book even stronger vaccine sales in the second half of the year as governments order more shots to get ready for fall vaccination campaigns.

Shares of CVS Health rose roughly 1.5% in the premarket after the drugstore and benefits management giant Wednesday morning reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue. CVS said demand increased for prescriptions as it saw a more typical cough, cold and flu season in the first quarter. Sales of over-the-counter Covid test kits helped results, but coronavirus vaccines and in-store testing declined. CVS also raised full-year guidance.

London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is finally getting aggressive in its bid to fight decades-high inflation .
What's happening: The central bank is expected to hike interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday for the first time since 2000. Investors think it will deliver hikes of the same magnitude in June and July.
But arriving late to the scene will have consequences.
Boosting rates just as growth starts slowing comes with a heightened risk of cooling activity so much it triggers a recession. And in just a few months, the Fed may pay the price for playing catch-up.
""I think they're paying too much attention to what's happened in the past and not enough attention to what's happening going forward,"" Guillaume Menuet, Citi Private Bank's head of investment strategy and economics in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told me.
Breaking it down: The Fed knows it needs to act decisively to keep inflation expectations from getting out of hand and to protect its credibility.
In March 2021, the central bank predicted median inflation in 2022 of just 2%. Fast forward one year, and the central bank's preferred measure of tracking consumer prices put inflation at 6.6% , the highest level in 40 years.
""We are late, late, late,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chairman of the Amundi Institute.
But getting tough right now won't be a clear fix for the problem. While raising interest rates sends an important signal, it typically takes 12 to 18 months for the impact of such a move to feed through to the economy.
Plus, while hiking rates can help put a lid on hot demand, it won't do anything to tackle the supply chain issues that have been a key driver of higher prices.
Meanwhile, the recovery from the pandemic is losing steam. Consumer spending is still strong, but news that the US economy shrank in the first three months of 2022 surprised economists
Elevated energy prices pose a big risk to consumption in the coming quarters, and a slowdown of activity in Europe and China could have global ramifications.
All this means that later this year, the Fed could find itself in a bind once again. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will face another conundrum: Should the central bank keep hiking interest rates to address inflation even if it tips the economy into recession, like Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s?
While Powell has expressed admiration for Volcker , both Menuet and Blanqué think it's unlikely that the Fed's current leader will channel his tactics for long. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the world has gotten very used to cheap money. That — plus the Fed's delay in starting to hike — will make it harder for the central bank to stay the course.
""I think it's probably going to be a case of short and sharp,"" Menuet said, referring to the Fed's tightening cycle.
Watch this space: The market expects the Fed to hike rates at every meeting for the rest of the year, achieving a main interest rate of more than 3% by the end of the 2022. If the Fed decides to prioritize normalizing interest rates over potential economic fallout, that's certainly possible.
But analysts at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute note that over time, interest rates have topped out at progressively lower levels. In 2006, they peaked at 5.25%, while in 2018, they only got as high as 2.5%. This time? Well, that depends on how long the Fed thinks it needs to compensate for its miscalculation on inflation.
EU proposes ban on Russian oil imports
The European Union is proposing to ban all oil imports from Russia and remove the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, from the SWIFT international payments network.
The latest: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday the measures would form part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, my CNN Business colleague Mark Thompson reports.
""We now propose a ban on Russian oil,"" she said during a speech to the European Parliament. ""Let's be clear: it will not be easy. But we simply have to work on it. We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, to maximize pressure on Russia, while minimizing the impact on our own economies.""
Crude oil supply would be phased out within six months, and imports of refined oil products by the end of 2022, she added.
News of the proposal, which still needs the approval of all EU member states, boosted crude oil prices. Last year, Russia accounted for about 27% of EU oil imports. The bloc will need to find supply elsewhere at a time when the market is already strained.
Market reaction: Brent futures, the global benchmark, rose more than 4% to above $109 a barrel, while US oil futures climbed above $106.80.
Oil prices have risen by about 40% since the start of the year on fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will deliver a supply shock, fueling inflation and piling pressure on European economies.
EU countries have already agreed to phase out Russian coal imports but the bloc has found it much harder to reach consensus on oil sanctions despite weeks of talks.
But it's not a done deal yet. Hungary recently reiterated its opposition to an oil embargo, and Slovakia is reportedly seeking an exemption.
There are a record number of open jobs in America
Want another sign that the Federal Reserve is in a tight spot? Just look at the latest data on US job openings, which hit a record high in March.
The United States had 11.5 million open positions that month, the highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 2000. The number of Americans who quit their jobs also hit an all-time high of 4.5 million.
On one hand, the data is a sign that the Federal Reserve has been effective in its aim of keeping policy loose to support the job market's recovery from the pandemic, even as it overlooked inflation. Companies are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs each month, and people who want better pay or working conditions are finding it easy to switch from one role to another.
""Workers continue to quit and get hired at fast rates in today's economy,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute. ""This 'churn' is a positive sign of a strengthening labor market where workers can quit, search and obtain new opportunities.""
But the massive number of job openings has also become part of the problem.
Employers need to pay more to find the workers they need, raising their costs. They then hike prices to maintain their margins — which in turn compels workers to ask for even higher wages to cover their expenses, creating a vicious cycle known as the ""wage-price spiral"" that policymakers are desperate to avoid.

With inflation showing little sign of easing from its 40-year highs, the US central bank has set itself on a hawkish course of tightening this year, sending shivers through world markets.
The prospect of higher borrowing costs has been compounded by a range of crises including the war in Ukraine, elevated oil prices and China’s COVID lockdowns that have strangled crucial global supply chains.
The Fed now has to walk a fine line between getting control of surging prices and making sure it does not knock the recovery in the world’s top economy off course.
“The Fed remains very focused on bringing inflation down, however, any further hawkish pivots will likely be tempered to some extent by the desire to achieve a soft landing,” said Blerina Uruci at T. Rowe Price.
The Fed is expected to announce a half-percentage point lift Wednesday—its biggest since 2000—but boss Jerome Powell’s post-meeting news conference will be closely watched for an idea about future hikes.
Speculation was swirling that 75 basis points could be on the table at some point this year.
“Powell will fall back to ‘we are not on pre-set rate hikes’ or something along those lines—’we go in with an open mind each meeting and will talk it over and we’ll see where we go from there’,” said Tony Farren, managing director at Mischler Financial Group.
“The market would take that as hawkish. For his comments to seem dovish, he’d have to shut down the talk of 75 basis points. And while I don’t think he’ll endorse it, I don’t think he’ll shut it down.”
After a broadly positive lead from Wall Street, Asian markets struggled in holiday-thinned trade.
Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai and Singapore slipped, but Taipei rose while Wellington was flat.
Tokyo, Shanghai, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were closed.
Oil prices rose after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said the European Union would impose a gradual Russian oil ban in retaliation for the war in Ukraine.
The news offset the expected hit to demand from China’s coronavirus lockdowns, including in the country’s biggest city, Shanghai.
A huge release of crude from reserves by dozens of countries including the United States has also helped keep prices tempered.
Investors are waiting for a meeting Thursday of OPEC and other major producers including Russia, where they will discuss whether or not to lift output more than expected. With AFP

9,U.S. Federal Reserve expected to step up inflation fight with big interest rate hike,2022-05-04T11:57:46Z,A policy statement is due to be released at 2 p.m. EDT on Wednesday following the end of the Federal Reserve’s latest two-day meeting,"An eagle tops the Federal Reserve building's facade in Washington, on July 31, 2013.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to raise interest rates by half of a percentage point and announce the start of reductions to its $9-trillion balance sheet as U.S. central bankers intensify efforts to bring down high inflation.
Fed policy-makers have widely telegraphed a double-barrelled decision that would lift the Fed’s short-term target policy rate to a range between 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent, and set in motion a plan to trim its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by as much $95-billion a month.
The policy statement is due to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) following the end of the Fed’s latest two-day meeting.
Markets have priced in further rate increases through this year and into next, including at least a couple more half-percentage-point hikes, as traders bet the central bank moves much more quickly than it had anticipated it would in March to get borrowing costs up to where they will start actively curbing inflation.
With no fresh Fed economic or policy rate projections due until the central bank’s June meeting, most clues on how far and how fast it is prepared to go will come from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, which starts at 2:30 p.m. EDT.
The Fed began its current round of policy tightening in mid-March with a quarter-percentage-point rate hike, smaller than many policy-makers had wanted given inflation had hit a 40-year high, but calibrated so as not to inject more uncertainty into global markets roiled by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
In the weeks since that decision, inflation has gained new steam as the war pushed up oil and food prices and China’s strict lockdowns to combat the spread of COVID-19 further disrupted supply chains.
Data on the U.S. labour market also suggests increasing labour market tightness, with employment costs surging as businesses struggle to hold onto workers. A record number of job openings may also translate to higher wages that could also feed through to inflation.
All that is ratcheting up the pressure on the Fed to act more decisively to rein things in.
“Powell will continue to have a strong incentive to sound hawkish,” Piper Sandler economist Roberto Perli said this week. “The Fed’s focus these days is 100 per cent on bringing inflation down, and hawkish expectations help that cause.”
In the run-up to this week’s meeting, Powell has said he wants to get rates “expeditiously” to what Fed policy-makers regard as a “neutral” range of 2.25 per cent-2.5 per cent, and then higher if needed.
Most of his colleagues appear to be on board with at least the first part of that plan.
The aim would be to lift borrowing costs high enough and fast enough that households slow spending and businesses pare hiring in response, reducing inflation that is now about three times the Fed’s 2 per cent target.
But the central bank wants to avoid raising rates so high or so fast that it short-circuits the labour market and trips up the economy. The U.S. unemployment rate has only just dropped to 3.6 per cent, near the pre-pandemic level, and any large reversal could be a prelude to a recession.
The Fed has managed “soft landings” infrequently in the past, analysts say, and at this point has allowed inflation to rise so much faster than interest rates that it may have already missed its chance to do so.
And while it is expected to raise rates rather quickly now to compensate, the inflation path will also depend on a number of factors beyond the Fed’s control, including the evolution of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and ongoing supply and labour shortages connected to both.
The Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet will also be a focus on Wednesday. While the broad outlines were disclosed about three weeks ago in minutes of the Fed’s March meeting, investors expect to learn details of the speed and extent of the plan, including possible MBS sales at some point in the future.

10,Stock market news live updates: Stock futures drift higher as traders brace for Fed decision,2022-05-04T11:39:48Z,"U.S. stock futures opened little changed Tuesday evening, with investors looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision against the backdrop of elevated inflation and a still-tight U.S. labor market. Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, while Dow futures dipped.","U.S. stock futures edged higher Wednesday morning, with investors looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision against the backdrop of elevated inflation and a still-tight U.S. labor market.
Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq each rose in pre-market trading. Treasury yields steadied, and the benchmark 10-year yield hovered just below 3%, or near its highest level since late 2018.
Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement and press conference from Chair Jerome Powell later Wednesday afternoon. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points for the first time since 2000. Such a hike would be double the 25 basis-point increase the Fed unleashed in mid-March, which itself had been the first rate hike since 2018. This would bring the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.75% and 1.00%, compared to the current range of between 0.25% and 0.50%.
Expectations for this supersized rate hike have built for weeks now amid market participants, especially given commentary from key Federal Reserve officials appearing to support such a move. Powell said during a public appearance with the International Monetary Fund earlier this month that he believed it would be ""appropriate ... to be moving a little more quickly"" on raising rates, and that 50 basis points were ""on the table"" for May. And the Fed is also expected to use the May meeting to announce the start of quantitative tightening, or rolling assets off the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet.
Prospects of higher interest rates have stirred up volatility in equity markets, which had grown accustomed over the past two years to ultra-low interest rates and generally easy-money monetary policies. At the same time, however, many pundits have suggested the Fed allowed its pandemic-era supportive policies to run too long, allowing inflation to soar to the fastest rates since the 1980s. And after GDP growth turned negative in the U.S. in the first three months of the year, a lingering question remains whether the Fed will now be able to tighten policies without tipping the economy into a deep downturn.
Story continues
""Because the market has priced in a 50 basis point rate hike at the Federal Reserve's May meeting, the focus will immediately shift to just how many half-point hikes the Fed expects to initiate over the balance of 2022,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence, wrote in an email Tuesday. ""The Fed would shock markets if it failed to deliver on more aggressive policy via a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday.""
""The Federal Reserve's credibility is on the line, given the surge in inflation, which has proved to be anything but transitory,"" Booth added. ""Interest rates are too low and markets have been way too accustomed to almost unlimited liquidity from the Fed's bond purchases. Powell's greatest folly would be to insist that the economy is very strong in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is slowing and slowing fast.""

7:39 a.m. ET: Uber posts better-than-expected quarterly results, guidance
Uber (UBER) posted estimates-topping first-quarter results and current-quarter guidance Wednesday morning, with the ride-hailing company signaling it was working through driver shortages while maintaining solid profitability.
Revenue more than doubled during the first quarter to reach $6.9 billion, topping estimates for $6.1 billion, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $168 million, also coming in ahead of the $135 million expected. Trips during the first quarter increased by 18% over last year to reach 17.1 billion, underscoring the ongoing recovery in rider demand.
For the current quarter, Uber said it sees gross bookings coming in between $28.5 million and $29.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of between $240 million and $270 million.
Uber shares pared losses in early trading following the results. Earlier during the overnight session, Uber shares had slumped in sympathy with Lyft's stock, which slid after the ride-hailing company offered a current-quarter revenue and profit forecast that fell short of analyst expectations.
Uber was previously scheduled to report its quarterly results after market close on Wednesday, but after Lyft's report, ""rescheduled to provide a more timely update on the company’s performance and guidance before the market opens,"" according to a statement.

Emerging markets shares were already jittery ahead of the Fed decision as investors look for clues on its thinking about the future pace of hikes, with a 50 basis point increase already priced in. MSCI's index of developing world shares deepened losses in its third straight session of declines, down 0.6%.
Indian shares posted their worst session in two months, while the 10-year benchmark bond yield jumped to 7.41%, its highest level since May 2019, after the Reserve Bank of India hiked the key interest rate by 40 basis points in an off-cycle meeting to rein in inflation. The rupee briefly hit 76.18 a dollar, before trading back at levels before the decision. It was last at 76.34.
""Looking ahead, further rate hikes look nailed on. After all, the rise in headline inflation (in India) has further to run... We now expect the repo rate to end this year at 5.65%,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics. The impact on the equity market is likely to be negative in the short term, said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities.
Further curbing risk appetite, the European Union proposed a phased oil embargo on Russia in its sixth sanctions package over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The proposal also included sanctions on Russia's top bank and banning its broadcasters from European airwaves. But Russia's rouble jumped to around two-year highs against both the dollar and the euro, supported by strong capital controls. The offshore rouble was at around 66 to the dollar. In Moscow it was at around 68, recovering sharply over two months from its all-time low of 121 per dollar hit in March.
With more sanctions against Russian oil spurring global crude prices, oil-importing countries such as India, the Philippines, and Turkey face more pain. In more central bank news, Pakistan named Murtaza Syed, a deputy governor of the bank as its new chief as the country restarts talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a stalled $6 billion program.
Syed will take over upon the expiry of the three-year term of incumbent Reza Baqir, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Wednesday. Pakistan markets were closed for Eid-ul-Fitr.

May 4 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a two-day policy meeting and is expected to move against surging inflation -- including possibly making its highest interest rate hike in decades. The Fed last met in the middle of March when it raised rates by a quarter-point. It was the first time it raised the federal funds rate since 2018 and followed two years of rate decreases and emergency actions to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. Advertisement
At the end of its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee is expected by many analysts to order a rate hike of a half-point -- which would be its largest single hike in 22 years.
Many investors have said they also expect the Fed to make similar rate increases at each of its next three policy meetings -- in June, July and September.
Advertisement
The move would be the Fed's biggest punch yet against inflation, which rose over the 12 months ending in March by close to 7% -- the steepest clip since 1982.
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -- a top indicator of inflation -- rose by 6.6% and gross domestic product -- the total output of all goods and services -- shrank unexpectedly by 1.4% when most economists expected modest growth of about 1%.
The Federal Reserve's target range -- the clip by which it prefers to see inflation rise on an annual basis -- is 2%. The gauge in March indicated an inflationary surge at more than three times that rate.
Further, high demand has outpaced what businesses are able to deliver as some employers struggling to find enough workers to operate at normal efficiency.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings by the end of March reached 11.5 million -- a record -- against about 6.3 million separations. That means there are roughly two open positions for every unemployed adult in the United States.

In addition to hiking interest rates, the Fed is also expected to announce the start of a program to wind down its $9 trillion balance sheet by $95 billion per month, beginning in June.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that the central bank is aiming for what economists call a ""soft landing"" as it seeks to raise interest rates to discourage spending enough to lower inflation without triggering a recession.
""That's our goal,"" he said. ""I don't think you'll hear anyone at the Fed say that's going to be straightforward or easy.""
In order to achieve this, Fed policymakers said at the March meeting that rates would need to rise nearly 2 points this year and even more in 2023. That would require the central bank to hike rates aggressively to start and then monitor the performance of the economy and adjust the pace of increases accordingly, Powell said at the International Monetary Fund forum last month.
""It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly,"" he said. ""I also think there's something in the idea of a front-end loading whatever accommodation one thinks is appropriate.""

While most expect a half-point increase Wednesday, economists at JPMorgan say there's a 20% chance that the Fed will go for a three-quarter-point hike, but the market did not price in that possibility heading into the meeting.
""It seems like they're dead set on hiking rates enough to kill inflation,"" Jim Caron, chief fixed income strategist on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said according to CNBC. ""But that's the real debate.
""Are they trying to get target inflation by 2024? If they are, the wage inflation is pretty high and that will require even more tightening than the Fed is projecting.""
One thing seems certain -- the Fed will hike rates on Wednesday by some measure. Leaving them unchanged wouldn't do anything to address riding prices in the United States, which President Joe Biden has promised to get control of.
One of the primary drivers of inflation over the past year has been the rising cost of gas. AAA on Wednesday listed a national average of $4.23, which is 2 cents higher than it was Tuesday and about 10 cents higher than a week ago.

For a time in recent weeks, prices at the pump were going down -- the result of improving market conditions and policy actions by President Joe Biden. The ongoing war in Ukraine, and the U.S. embargo of Russian oil, and the onset of the busier summer driving season are causing prices to tick back up.
Rising rates, which would make it more expensive for Americans to take out a loan or carry a balance on a credit card, also raises the interest on buying a home.
Last month, Freddie Mac said that rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit an average of more than 5% -- nearly 2% above from where they were a year ago. Home purchases have slowed across the country due to rising mortgage rates, limited inventory and in anticipation of the Fed's rate hike Wednesday.
As a result of the fluid market conditions, sales of existing homes have declined by close to 3%, the National Association of Realtors said according to the most recent data available.
However, in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets, such as New York's Hudson Valley, realtors have reported steady sales.
""In the past two months, interest rates have gone from 3.5% to 5.5%, which is a dramatic increase, and I don't see that that's affecting competition at all,"" Ryan Basten, a broker associate in Ulster County, N.Y., told The Washington Post. ""If it gets to 6, 7 or 8%, then people may have a knee-jerk reaction to that, but I haven't seen it yet.""

13,Fed raises interest rates by half a percentage point,2022-05-04T10:21:42Z,The Federal Reserve is attempting to get a handle on the worst inflation America has seen in 40 years.,"New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is raising interest rates by a half-percentage point to get a handle on the worst inflation America has seen in 40 years.
It's the first time in 22 years that the central bank has hiked rates this much.
In March, it ramped up its benchmark borrowing rate for the first time since late 2018, increasing it by a quarter-percentage point.
The central bank cited high inflation, as well as the strong labor market in its post-meeting statement.
Americans are struggling with rising costs everywhere from the grocery store to the gas pump. And with the Russia-Ukraine conflict still raging, price pressures on food and energy are unlikely to abate any time soon.

Highlights The Federal Reserve Bank of New York works within the Federal Reserve System
It works to foster the safety, soundness and vitality of US economic and financial systems
It is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks which make up the Federal Reserve System
IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday announced that 60-year-old Krishna has been elected as a Class B director, ""representing the public with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labour, and consumers.""
The New York Fed said in a statement that Krishna will fill the vacancy in the office for the remaining portion of a three-year term ending December 31, 2023.
""In his current and former roles, Krishna has led the building and expansion of new markets for IBM in the cloud, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing. He has also played a significant role in the development of innovative IBM products and solutions based on these emerging technologies,"" the statement added.
Krishna, who has an undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and a PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, previously was senior vice president of Cloud and Cognitive Software. He also headed IBM Research and was the general manager of IBM Systems and Technology Group's development and manufacturing organisation.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York works within the Federal Reserve System and with other public and private sector institutions to foster the safety, soundness and vitality of US economic and financial systems. It is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks which, together with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System.
The Fed, as the system is commonly called, is an independent governmental entity created by Congress in 1913 to serve as the central bank of the United States.
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 requires each of the Reserve Banks to operate under the supervision of a board of directors. Each Reserve Bank has nine directors who represent the interests of their Reserve District and whose experience provides the Reserve Banks with a wider range of expertise that helps them fulfill their policy and operational responsibilities, the statement said.
The nine directors of each Reserve Bank are divided evenly by classification: three Class A directors represent the member banks in the district; three Class B directors and Class C directors each represent the interests of the public, it said.
The directors of the Reserve Banks act as an important link between the Federal Reserve and the private sector, ensuring that the Fed's decisions on monetary policy are informed by actual economic conditions, it added.
The New York Fed oversees the Second Federal Reserve District, which includes New York state, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey, Fairfield County in Connecticut, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Though it serves a geographically small area compared with those of other Federal Reserve Banks, the New York Fed is the largest Reserve Bank in terms of assets and volume of activity, according to information on the Fed's website.

The BoE policy announcement on Thursday will be the key event for sterling this week, with policymakers expected to raise interest rates for the fourth consecutive meeting, the first such run since 1997.
The pound has weakened in recent weeks on expectations that the BoE may have to slow the pace of tightening as the central bank battles with above-target inflation and a cost-of-living crisis that is showing signs of weighing on economic activity. Shop prices in Britain surged last month at the fastest rate in more than a decade, according to a survey published on Wednesday that spelt further bad news for many households caught in the worsening crisis.
The Fed meanwhile is expected to hike rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, the first half-percentage point hike in over two decades. ""The worst scenario would be a hawkish FOMC meeting, with still-cautious BoE policy guidance,"" writes OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley.
""That likely sees GBP/USD testing 1.2200."" At 0812 GMT, sterling was up 0.1% against the U.S. dollar at $1.2508, after hitting its lowest level since July 2020 at $1.2412 last week.

European stock markets are off to a slow start as most investors are preparing for a US interest rate rise when the Federal Reserve meets later today.
The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) dipped marginally 0.3% to 7,532.95 after opening, while the CAC (^FCHI) shed 0.1% in Paris. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) was down 0.1%.
The London benchmark was dragged down by mining stocks. Rio Tinto (RIO.L) lost over 3% and Anglo American (AAL.L) fell 1.5% after being downgraded by brokers at Liberum. Glencore (GLNCY) also lost ground, falling 1.9% in early trading.
UK investors also have the prospect of a rate rise from the Bank of England tomorrow, with the consensus being that the central bank will raise the interest rate to 1%.

HSBC (HSBA.L) gained 0.9%, after it kicked off its planned $1bn share buyback.
Flutter (FLTR.L) jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 despite revealing a £30m hit from safer gambling laws and a slowdown in online betting revenues.
Online fashion retailer Boohoo (BOO.L) dropped 11.6%, as it reported a 28% fall in annual core earnings that reflected significant freight and logistics cost inflation and warned that pandemic-related external factors would continue to impact it this year.
Still, traders are mostly keeping to the sidelines ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s rate decision. The central bank is expected to hike rates by 50 basis points for the first time since the year 2000.
CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson, in a note, said that a 50 basis point rate rise today would be of no surprise to most in the market, taking the Fed interest rate to 1%.
“This is the least of market expectations, when it comes to what the Fed may well announce today, with an outside chance we might get some members push for a 75bps hike,” the analyst said in a note. “The biggest question will be around the pace of its balance sheet reduction program along with the pace of subsequent rate hikes, with the potential for another 50bps hike to come in June,”
Story continues
He added: “Powell’s comments at the IMF, that the Fed could well go much harder, and a lot quicker on rate hikes has prompted concern that the Fed may well overplay its hand at a time when the global economy looks set for a sustained slowdown, as China continues to lose its battle with COVID.”

Meanwhile, oil prices pushed higher as the EU outlined plans to phased out imports of Russian crude over the next six months. Brent crude (BZ=F) was trading at $108 a barrel this Wednesday morning.
The ban will cover all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.
She vowed to phase out the supplies in an “orderly fashion”, hitting crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year.
Across the pond, the market finished in the green. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed 0.4% higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) advanced 0.2%. The Dow Jones (^DJI) also made gains, closing 0.2% higher on Tuesday.

Aston Martin Lagonda chief executive Tobias Moers is leaving with immediate effect, to be replaced by ex-Ferrari boss Amedeo Felisa.

He said Felisa, who is already a non-executive director at Aston Martin, had an “excellent track record” and previous experience of leading a major ultra-luxury car manufacturer. Stroll added: “His technical acumen and charisma will be inspirational for the entire company.”

23,The Fed Is Set to Pull Back Economic Help Rapidly. Is It Too Late?,2022-05-04T07:00:08Z,Federal Reserve officials took a while to recognize that inflation was lasting. The question is whether they can tame it gently now.,"Fed officials cut interest rates to near-zero in March 2020 as state and local economies locked down to slow the coronavirus’s spread at the start of the pandemic. They kept them there until March this year, when they raised rates a quarter point.
But the Fed’s balance-sheet approach has been the more widely criticized policy. The Fed began buying government-backed debt in huge quantities at the outset of the pandemic to calm bond markets. Once conditions settled, it bought bonds at a pace of $120 billion, and continued making purchases even as it became clear that the economy was healing more swiftly than many had anticipated and inflation was high.
Late-2021 and early-2022 bond purchases, which are what critics tend to focus on, came partly because Mr. Powell and his colleagues did not initially think that inflation would become longer lasting. They labeled it “transitory” and predicted that it would fade on its own — in line with what many private-sector forecasters expected at the time.
When supply chain disruptions and labor shortages persisted into the fall, pushing up prices for months on end and driving wages higher, central bankers reassessed. But even after they pivoted, it took time to taper down bond buying, and the Fed made its final purchases in March. Because officials preferred to stop buying bonds before lifting rates, that delayed the whole tightening process.
The central bank was trying to balance risks: It did not want to quickly withdraw support from a healing labor market in response to short-lived inflation earlier in 2021, and then officials did not want to roil markets and undermine their credibility by rapidly reversing course on their balance sheet policy. They did speed up the process in an attempt to be nimble.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/business/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-recession.html

Article content Treasuries fluctuated and stocks remained higher following the decision, as investors digested his guidance that appeared to pour cold water on the chances of a jumbo-sized 75 basis-point increase in the months ahead. The increase in the FOMC’s target for the federal funds rate, to a range of 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, follows a quarter-point hike in March that ended two years of near-zero rates to help cushion the U.S. economy against the initial blow from COVID-19. Policy makers, who widely signalled their intention to step up the pace of rate increases, are trying to curb the hottest inflation since the early 1980s. Back then, Chair Paul Volcker raised rates as high as 20 per cent and crushed both inflation and the broader economy in the process. The Fed’s hope this time around is that the combination of higher borrowing costs and a shrinking balance sheet will deliver a soft landing that avoids recession while tamping down inflation.

While officials have so far downplayed that idea, several have in recent weeks expressed a desire to “expeditiously” bring the federal funds rate to around 2.5 per cent by the end of the year, a level they deem roughly “neutral” for the U.S. economy.

BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Thursday after the Federal Reserve chairman downplayed the likelihood of bigger rate hikes following the U.S. central bank’s biggest increase in two decades.
Shanghai, Hong Kong, Australia and Southeast Asian markets advanced. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays.
Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 3% on Wednesday for its best day in two years after the Fed raised its key interest rate by half a percentage point, or double its usual margin, but its chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank is “not actively considering” a bigger increase.

The Fed’s rate hike and Powell’s comments “demonstrate that the Fed continues to try and orchestrate a soft landing while tackling high levels of inflation,” David Chao of Invesco said in a report.
The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7% to 3,068.10 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4% to 20,949.22.
Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.6% to 7,349.60. New Zealand and Singapore also gained.
The Fed raised its key rate to a range of 0.75% to 1%, the highest point since the coronavirus pandemic struck two years ago.
Powell’s comments appeared to be aimed at easing fears the Fed, which was accused of reacting too slowly as inflation surged last year, might be headed for an unusually large rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point at its June meeting.
Investors worry about whether the Fed can extinguish inflation without pushing the economy into a downturn.
The Fed announced details of how it will start reducing its holdings of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities. The central bank has been buying bonds to pump money into the financial system and push down long-term interest rates.
Powell said the U.S. economy can make it through rate increases without falling into a recession.

World shares were mostly lower on Wednesday as investors waited for a decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates.
Central banks in many countries are raising rates as inflation squeezes businesses and consumers. To counter that, regulators are gradually increasing costs for borrowing that had dipped to record lows during the pandemic.
Fed policymakers are expected to raise the U.S. central bank's benchmark rate by twice the usual amount this week, ramping up their fight against inflation that is at a four-decade high. The Fed already has raised its key overnight rate once, the first such increase since 2018, and Wall Street is expecting several big increases over the coming months.
“All eyes are peering toward the FOMC meeting and a rate hike is an absolute given,"" Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, said in a commentary.

India’s Sensex lost 1% to 56,425.88. Taiwan’s benchmark rose and most other regional markets were closed, including those in Japan and mainland China.
The higher lending rates may crimp economic growth as they come at a time when surging prices are squeezing consumers’ capacity to spend.
Market players might pick up bargains on the assumption that the rate increase has already been taken into account, Bennett said. But he added that “this excludes the on-going shock to consumers and particularly mortgage holders that will reverberate in an accelerating fashion throughout the economy. This ‘pain’ process will likely continue for the next one to three years in the real world.""

Adding to that are the uncertainties brought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russian forces unleashed artillery fire on towns in eastern Ukraine, killing and wounding dozens of civilians, and were storming a bombed-out steel mill containing the last pocket of resistance in Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol as more than 100 civilians evacuated from the bombed-out plant reached relative safety in Ukrainian held territory.
Oil prices rose as the European Union said it was preparing new sanctions against Russian energy over the war in Ukraine, though Slovakia and Hungary said they would oppose such measures.
Newly proposed sanctions drafted by the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, could include a phased-in embargo on Russian oil. That could strain supplies and push prices still higher.

Key Facts
Stocks moved higher following the Federal Reserve’s announcement: The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.9%, over 900 points, while the S&P 500 rose 3.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.3%. Investors cheered what was a widely expected move from the Federal Reserve, which hiked interest rates by a half-percentage point—the largest increase in over two decades—as it looks to combat historically high levels of inflation. The central bank also indicated that it would begin reducing its $9 trillion balance sheet by offloading bonds each month: Starting in June, roughly $30 billion of Treasurys and $17.5 billion of mortgage-backed securities will be rolled off. Traders expect the Federal Reserve to continue aggressively raising interest rates in the next few months, and with the federal funds rate now at a range of 0.75% to 1%, current market expectations are for the rate to reach 3% by the end of 2022. The central bank’s announcement was “overall about as dovish as could be expected while still showing that the Fed is serious about fighting inflation,” according to Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, briefly surpassed 3% before paring back gains somewhat, trading just below its highest level since 2018.
Crucial Quote:
The Federal Reserve “delivered what it had promised in terms of the rate hike and the balance sheet taper—and markets are reacting accordingly,” with no major sell-off occurring after the announcement, points out Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
What To Watch For:
The “black hole of tech negativity” in markets, with tech stocks continuing to get “demolished” as investors “puke out of this sector,” according to Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli.
Key Background:
Stocks are rebounding from a brutal sell-off in April, with experts warning of continued volatility ahead. The Dow and S&P 500 both recorded their worst month since March 2020, down 4.9% and 8.8%, respectively, while the Nasdaq posted its worst month since 2008, falling over 13%.

31,Fed Raises Key Rate by a Half-Point in Bid to Tame Inflation,2022-05-04T04:00:00Z,The Federal Reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short-term interest rate by a half-percentage point.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short-term interest rate by a half-percentage point Wednesday — its most aggressive move since 2000 — and signaling further large rate hikes to come.
The increase in the Fed’s key rate raised it to a range of 0.75% to 1%, the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago.
The Fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge $9 trillion balance sheet, which consists mainly of Treasury and mortgage bonds. Those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the Fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long-term borrowing rates. Reducing the Fed’s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy.
All told, the Fed’s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time, including for mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.
Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming.
“There is a broad sense on the committee,” he said, referring to the Fed, “that additional (half-point) increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings.”
With prices for food, energy and consumer goods accelerating, the Fed’s goal is to cool spending — and economic growth — by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow. The central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession.
It will be a delicate balancing act. The Fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit, and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession.
In their statement Wednesday, the central bank’s policymakers said they are “highly attentive to inflation risks.” The statement also noted that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices. It added that “COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions,” which could further boost inflation.
Inflation, according to the Fed’s preferred gauge, reached 6.6% last month, the highest point in four decades. Inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending, chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices, exacerbated by Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Starting June 1, the Fed said it would allow up to $48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them, a pace that would reach $95 billion by September. At September’s pace, its balance sheet would shrink by about $1 trillion a year.
Powell has said he wants to quickly raise the Fed’s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. Fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point, which the Fed says is about 2.4%, by year’s end.
The Fed’s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy. Sales of existing homes sank 2.7% from February to March, reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related, in part, to the Fed’s planned rate hikes. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year, to 5.1%.
Yet by most measures, the overall economy remains healthy. This is especially true of the U.S. job market: Hiring is strong, layoffs are few, unemployment is near a five-decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high.
Powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight – “to an unhealthy level” that would tend to fuel inflation. The Fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings, which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures, without triggering mass layoffs.
For now, with hiring robust — the economy has added at least 400,000 jobs for 11 straight months — and employers grappling with labor shortages, wages are rising at a roughly 5% annual pace. Those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices. In March, consumers increased their spending 0.2% even after adjusting for inflation.
Even if the Fed’s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2.5% by year’s end, Powell said last month, the policymakers may still tighten credit further — to a level that would restrain growth — “if that turns out to be appropriate.”
Financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3.6% by mid-2023, which would be the highest in 15 years. Shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the Fed’s actions may weaken the economy.
Complicating the Fed’s task is a slowdown in global growth. COVID-19 lockdowns in China are threatening to cause a recession in the world’s second-largest economy. And the European Union is facing higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
What’s more, other central banks around the world are also raising rates, a trend that could further imperil global growth. On Thursday, the Bank of England is expected to raise its key rate for the fourth straight time. The Reserve Bank of Australia increased its rate Tuesday for the first time in 11 years.
And the European Central Bank, which is grappling with slower growth than in the United States or the United Kingdom, may raise rates in July, economists expect.",https://www.snopes.com/ap/2022/05/04/fed-raises-key-rate-by-a-half-point-in-bid-to-tame-inflation/

May 4 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said central bank officials are not ""actively"" considering a rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point at coming monetary policy meetings.
""A 75 basis point increase is not something that the committee is actively considering,"" Powell said in response to a question at a press conference following the Fed's latest meeting, at which it decided to lift rates by half a percentage point and signaled more increases are coming.
Interest rate futures markets had been assigning a significant probability to the Fed lifting rates by three quarters of a point at its next meeting in June.

At a news conference after the decision Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that “inflation is much too high” and that the Fed is “moving expeditiously to bring it back down.”

He noted that policymakers could continue increasing rates by larger than normal increments as they did Wednesday.
“There is a broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings,” Powell said.
Policymakers spent much of 2021 hoping that inflation would ease on its own as supply shortages moderated and as the economy evened out after early pandemic disruptions. But normalcy has yet to return, and inflation has only accelerated. Now, fresh pandemic-related lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine are further elevating prices for goods, food, and fuel. At the same time, workers are in short supply, and wages are rising rapidly in the United States, feeding into higher prices for services as consumer demand remains strong.
The “lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions,” and the invasion of Ukraine “and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity,” the Federal Open Market Committee statement for May said. “The committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.”

The Fed reiterated that “inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures.”
Fed officials have decided that they no longer have the luxury of waiting for inflation to moderate on its own and are expected to continue raising rates at their meetings throughout the year, with many investors expecting large increases in June and July. Some officials have even signaled that a 0.75 percentage point move could be possible, although Powell said that such a big increase is “not something the committee is actively considering.”
While the Fed acknowledged that inflation may remain fast as China supply disruptions and the war in Ukraine exacerbate price pressures, some analysts doubted that would warrant an even larger move.
“What they are trying to do is tell the market: Inflation could be higher in the near term,” Gennadiy Goldberg, a rates strategist at TD Securities, said of the Fed’s Ukraine and China references. “It doesn’t suggest that they should be hiking 75 basis points, because this isn’t the type of inflation the Fed can control.”
Deciding how quickly to remove policy support is a fraught exercise. Central bankers are hoping to move decisively enough to arrest the pop in prices without curbing growth so aggressively that they tip the economy into a painful recession. Yet engineering a so-called soft landing is likely to be a challenge.

Powell nodded to that balancing act, saying, “I do expect that this will be very challenging. It’s not going to be easy.” But he added, “I think we have a good chance to have a soft or soft-ish landing.”
The Fed plans to shrink its balance sheet starting in June by allowing securities to mature without reinvestment. It said Wednesday that it will ultimately let up to $60 billion in Treasury debt expire each month, along with $35 billion in mortgage-backed debt. That plan will have phased in fully as of September.
The Fed’s plan to reduce its holdings is likely to take steam out of financial markets and could help to cool the housing market as it lifts longer-term borrowing costs, reinforcing the effect of the central bank’s interest rate increases.

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - There’s a lot that could blow up in the Federal Reserve’s face. The U.S. central bank has little choice but to hike interest rates and shrink its balance sheet to fight inflation. But Chair Jay Powell’s moves make markets more vulnerable to shocks and could even tip the American economy into a recession.
With inflation read more at a 40-year high, the Fed is rushing along the path to a more normal monetary policy. A central bank committee on Wednesday is expected to raise the official cost of borrowing by 0.5 percentage points, its biggest hike since 2000. It also will likely announce the start of reducing its $9 trillion balance sheet. That will probably mean eventually rolling off $95 billion in Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities every month.
The shift makes the financial system more vulnerable to financial tremors read more . Take the $24 trillion Treasury market, where glitches exposed by the pandemic-induced selloff have yet to be fixed. In early 2020, a frantic “dash for cash” left the key financial market short of liquidity, prompting the Fed to step in. The central bank’s holdings of government bonds have more than doubled since February 2020 to reach about $5.8 trillion.

Liquidity problems could quickly resurface as the Fed sheds such assets. The Treasury market has sold off because of the central bank’s hawkish tone and worries about how that could hurt the economy. The ICE BofA Treasury Index is down 9% this year.
Bigger-than-expected rate hikes are another danger. A good chunk of investors project a series of 0.5 percentage point increases at the next Fed meetings, according to the CME FedWatch tool. But persistent inflation means markets now reckon there’s a 20% probability of the Fed raising rates by 0.75 percentage points in June, something the central bank hasn’t done since 1994. Over the last 60 years, tighter monetary policy has tended to be followed by a recession, according to Piper Sandler.
Meanwhile, the Fed is at the mercy of factors that could upset the American economy and throw its plans off track. Major turns in the war in Ukraine read more or additional supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 lockdowns in China are possible hurdles. That all increases the risk of collateral damage as Powell navigates a field of financial land mines.

CONTEXT NEWS
- The U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to conclude its two-day meeting on May 4. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise the target range for the federal funds interest rate to between 0.75% to 1%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points.
- The Fed is also expected to announce the start of reducing its $9 trillion balance sheet. At the March meeting, FOMC participants generally agreed that maximum monthly reductions of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities would likely be appropriate. Those caps may be phased in.

36,Analysis: U.S. real rates up on hawkish Fed but inflation risk looms,2022-05-04T04:00:00Z,"A jump in U.S. real yields back into positive territory is a sign that a hawkish Federal Reserve is succeeding in tightening some financial conditions, but the jury is still out on how much of an impact higher rates will have on inflation.","Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 27, 2022.

NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - A jump in U.S. real yields back into positive territory is a sign that a hawkish Federal Reserve is succeeding in tightening some financial conditions, but the jury is still out on how much of an impact higher rates will have on inflation.
The U.S. central bank will likely increase rates by half a percentage point this week and launch quantitative tightening - the reversal of a bond buying program that injected extra liquidity in the pandemic-hit U.S. economy, but also contributed to its overheating as consumer demand picked up.
Plans to tighten monetary conditions have led to a selloff in U.S. bond markets this year and to rising yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), also known as real yields because they subtract projected inflation from the nominal yield on Treasury securities.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
Yields on the 10-year TIPS had been in negative territory since March 2020, meaning investors would have lost money on an annualized basis when buying a 10-year Treasury note, adjusted for inflation, but they jumped about 20 basis points on Monday from negative 0.057% on Friday.
""Negative real rates for the last two years incentivized everything from buying crypto to even gold, housing, stocks, basically anything that had a higher yield,"" said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG.
""Now that they are turning positive, it's definitely a tightening of financial conditions,"" he said.
Positive real yields are typically a sign of a good economic outlook. Rising real yields in recent weeks, however, have come with expected hikes from the Fed as the central bank embarks on an urgent need to contain inflation.
Nominal yields for the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes also rose this week, but by a smaller extent, with the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting 3% on Monday for the first time since December 2018.
For Dave Plecha, global head of fixed income at Dimensional Fund Advisors, the market is pricing not only the Fed's actions but also the effects of monetary tightening. He added that real yields turning positive on the far end of the curve reflects a movement toward historical averages.
""I don't think it's shocking to expect in the long run positive real yields on five, 10, 20, or 30-year TIPS"", he said.
The 10-year breakeven inflation rate - which shows inflation expectations by measuring the yield spread between 10-year TIPS and 10-year Treasury notes - declined to 2.91% this week, further retreating from 3.14% hit last week, the highest since at least September 2004.
""It's real rates that affect the economy, and if the Fed is trying to tighten financial conditions to slow down inflation .. they want to see real rates move higher"", said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors.
Tighter monetary policies are starting to have an impact on interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as mortgages, with demand starting to ebb in recent weeks. Junk bond spreads have also widened - although not to the extent seen in the early days of the pandemic. read more
The risk is that while the market may be pricing in lower inflation expectations due to a less accommodative Fed stance, prices will continue to remain elevated because of supply dynamics which are driven by factors over which central banks have no control, such as the Ukraine crisis or new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I don't really believe that just within a short period of time ... any of us are going to be able to see any real changes in inflation dynamics,"" said Yvette Klevan, managing director on the Global Fixed Income team at Lazard Asset Management.
Money market futures tied to the Fed's policy rate show heavy bets on the Fed funds rate hitting about 2.8% by the end of the year, compared with the current 0.33% level. Rate futures also priced in about 250 bps of tightening in 2022. FEDWATCH
But the Fed and other central banks may not be able to tighten conditions to the degree markets are expecting, said Klevan. ""Over the next year, I would lean on the side of saying that I don't think all of those hikes that are priced in are going to be realized,"" she said.

NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Stock market investors are heading into the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting announcement particularly pessimistic, with fresh milestones for bond yields and worries about rocketing inflation weighing on sentiment as the central bank is expected to hike rates further.
The benchmark S&P 500 is down over 12% so far this year after posting its biggest monthly drop in April since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. Treasury note hit 3% for the first time in over three years on Monday, doubling since the end of 2021.
The higher yields on U.S. government debt, which is viewed as virtually risk free, mean ""you probably are starting to lose some of those folks who had maybe crowded into dividend-paying stocks and were maybe having to take a little bit more risk for that income,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

“The implication for equities is you start to lose demand for stocks relative to fixed income,” Samana said.
Some investors are clearly very gloomy. Paul Tudor Jones, founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment Corp, told CNBC on Tuesday that he couldn't think of a ""worse environment than where we are right now for financial assets.""
As the 10-year yield has climbed this year, the S&P 500 has slid
In another weight on stocks, yields on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) - also known as real yields because they subtract projected inflation from the nominal yield on Treasury securities - have pushed solidly into positive territory after being in negative territory since March 2020.
Negative real yields have meant that an investor would have lost money on an annualized basis when buying a 10-year Treasury note, adjusted for inflation, a dynamic that has helped divert money from U.S. government bonds and into stocks and other risky assets. read more

The Cboe volatility index (.VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" has climbed from 20 just a couple weeks ago to over 36 on Monday, and finished just shy of 30 on Tuesday. An elevated VIX reflects increased investor expectations for choppy markets in the near term.
The Wall Street 'fear gauge' has risen well above its long-term median
Amid the market's slide, stock investors have reached new levels of pessimism. Bearish sentiment, which are expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, rose sharply to 59.4% in the latest survey by the American Association of Individual Investors. The last time bearish sentiment went above that level was in March 2009 during the financial crisis.
Reuters Graphics
Such weak sentiment can be a contrary positive indicator for stocks. The net spread in the AAII survey between bulls and bears fell to negative 43 percentage points in the latest survey, with a four-week average of negative 29 percentage points.
Since 1987, when such an average four-week spread has been below negative 10 percentage points, the S&P 500 has risen 15.5% on average over the next 12 months, according to RBC Capital Markets.

Indeed, some investors say the stock market could be set up for a short-term rally, should nothing from Wednesday's Fed meeting catch them off guard. Following the Fed's last meeting in March, the S&P 500 rallied 8% in the two weeks after the central bank raised rates by 25 basis points, as expected.
Traders in the options market remain cautious, with some measures of sentiment, including the put-to-call ratio of open contracts on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY.P) close to the most bearish they have been in recent years, according to Trade Alert data. Excessive bearish positioning can help drive sharp rallies if sentiment reverses abruptly.
“The sentiment is really bad... Everything is starting to line up to be very oversold and overdone in the short term,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. ""Assuming you don’t get a big hawkish surprise out of the Fed, you could see a rally.”

Key Facts
Following the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, the Federal Open Markets Committee said Wednesday afternoon it would raise the federal funds rate, which is the target interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend reserves, by 50 basis points to a target range of 0.75% to 1%—a widely expected move following a hike of 25 basis points on March 16. The increase—the largest since May 2000—was approved unanimously and comes after Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged inflation is ""much too high"" in late March and pledged to ""move expeditiously… to restore price stability."" For months, Fed policymakers signaled they would begin raising rates in March, but the pace and intensity of expected rate hikes has grown amid relentlessly strong inflation and criticism that the central bank waited too long to start raising rates. In a bid to further ease its economic stimulus measures, the Fed announced it would begin reducing the size of its balance sheet by as much as $47.5 billion per month beginning on June 1, and as much as $95 billion per month starting in September. Despite a choppy day of trading, stocks ticked up immediately after the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 138 points, or 0.4%, to 33,266 points by 2:10 p.m. ET, while the S&P also added 0.4%.
Crucial Quote
“Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially,” Fed officials said Wednesday, citing ongoing price pressure as a lingering economic concern and adding that they expect inflation—which clocked in at 8.5% in April—to return to a target of 2% ""with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy.""
Key Background
Government stimulus measures and historically low interest rates during the pandemic helped fuel one of the strongest bull markets ever, but stocks have struggled this year as the Fed raises rates and unwinds economic support to ease decades-high inflation. Uncertainty has come to a head in recent weeks, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting its worst month since 2008 in April, and the U.S. economy unexpectedly shrinking 1.4% last quarter. “A repricing of stocks is currently taking place due to rising interest rates, which mathematically makes stocks less attractive,” explains David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of $3.6 billion advisory the Bahnsen Group.
Surprising Fact
After rising 27% in 2021, the S&P is down 13% this year. The Nasdaq has plummeted nearly 22%.
Chief Critic
""The violent downside moves we have seen in certain stocks speaks volumes about the bubble-like conditions that the Fed caused with its stimulus,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Dallas-based Quill Intelligence, said Wednesday in emailed comments. ""The window for the Fed to engineer a soft landing has likely closed, since the economy is already starting to deteriorate before the bulk of the Fed's inflation-fighting tightening actions have taken place.""
What To Watch For
In a Friday note to clients, Bank of America economist Ethan Harris said the key risk to the economy is that inflation remains elevated next year. “Recession risks are low now, but elevated in 2023 as inflation could force the Fed to hike until it hurts,” he said. Last month's consumer price index report will be released on May 11, and the Fed's next policy meeting concludes on June 15.

41,"Rates are going up, then straight back down: Macquarie’s Shvets",2022-05-04T00:38:55Z,"The RBA and Federal Reserve are lifting rates in “inclement weather” and will be forced to unwind within a year, says Viktor Shvets, Macquarie’s deep thinking global strategist.","The so-called neutral rate, in which conditions are neither supportive nor restrictive, he said was critical.
Mr Shvets said that he believed that only the US Federal Reserve’s settings were far from that setting, implying only modest moves in interest rates from other central banks will trigger tighter financial conditions that will crimp inflation.
“Central banks are now tightening in inclement weather when there is no cyclical recovery. And at the same time, fiscal policies are contracting on a global basis,” he said.
That is why he argues that “disinflationary outcomes are more likely into 2023 and 2024 rather than inflation.”
Cusp of higher rates
The comments came 24 hours after a historic interest rate rise from the Reserve Bank and on the eve of an eagerly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting in which it is expected to enact a jumbo 50-basis-point rate increase.

Financial markets expect US Federal Fund’s rate to peak at about 2.75 per cent in about a year’s time, while the Reserve Bank target rate is forecast by the market to peak at over 3.5 per cent at that time.
While long-term bonds yields have surged higher, they have not kept pace with rises in shorter term rates, implying that pending rate increases will indeed stall the economic recovery and perhaps induce a recession.
Mr Shvets, who is widely followed in global markets for his big picture insights said that his view was that over the next decade or so there would be a “rapid oscillation between very high inflation and very high deflation” and governments and central banks try to adjust policies to prevailing economic and geopolitical circumstances.
“Unlike the previous 20 years, where outcomes were relatively modest, in other words, oscillation was very, very low. Now we’re going to have huge aptitude.
“So they’ll just go up and down quite rapidly and an incredibly high and incredibly low, and that’s what I call the inflation/ disinflation pendulum.
War to ‘last a long time’

Mr Shvets, who was born in Kyiv, Ukraine and was educated in the Soviet Union also offered his insights into the Ukraine and Russian conflict.
He said the conflict was likely to last for a “very long time”.
“There is no ground for compromise. What Russia wants Ukraine to do, Ukrainians will never be willing to do and what Ukrainians want Russia to do, Russia will never accept,” he said.
He also believed it was “wishful thinking” that there would be regime change, reminding Macquarie clients that it took “more than three centuries, slavery, two wars, and a pandemic to finally [get] rid of Romanovs in 2017”.

The Russian economy, he said, was also “well-balanced” albeit inefficient which meant there was little incentive for an uprising.
Russia he said had become a food exporter over the past decade and had added manufacturing, while hospitals were open, the trains ran on time and pensions were paid.
Meanwhile, military spending, while high at 6 per cent of GDP was well below the 25 per cent level during the Soviet era.
“The elites are stealing money, but they’re not stealing so much that the economy collapses,” he said. “It will take a lot to actually undermine that economy to a stage that you’re going to have popular uprising.”",https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/rates-are-going-up-then-straight-back-down-macquarie-s-shvets-20220504-p5aidd
