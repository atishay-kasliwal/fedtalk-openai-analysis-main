0,U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly inclined to allow Jerome Powell to complete his term as Federal Reserve Chair.

2,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly inclined to let Jerome Powell finish his term as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to sources from inside Trump's camp speaking to CNN."
3,"Although Trump has not finalized his decision, the prevailing sentiment among his economic team is that Powell should continue leading the central bank."
4,"Powell's term is scheduled to expire in May 2026, giving him ample time to contribute to the Federal Reserve's ongoing policies and strategies under Trump's influence."

6,"President-elect Donald Trump is likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump requesting anonymity to describe private conversations."
7,"Washington CNN —
 President-elect Donald Trump remains likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump who requested anonymity to describe private conversations."
8,"The adviser cautioned that Trump could always change his mind, but his present view — and that of Trump’s economic team — is that Powell should remain atop the central bank as it pursues its policy of cutting interest rates."
9,Trump in July told Bloomberg he had intended to keep Powell in his role at least for the duration of his term.
10,"Still, Powell was peppered with questions about his job security during his first post-election press conference Thursday."
11,Powell issued a terse “No” in response to a question about whether he would leave his Fed post before his term is up if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to.
12,Powell later clarified that he believes Trump cannot fire him.
13,"”Not permitted under the law,” Powell said."
14,"Trump appointed Powell, a Republican former private equity executive who served on the central bank’s governing board, to its top spot in 2018."
15,President Joe Biden reappointed him to a second four-year term.
16,"Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs alum who served as economic policy director during Trump’s first administration, is said to want the job, but former Trump officials have said the fact that Cohn resigned in protest over Trump’s steel tariffs makes it highly unlikely he’d get it."
17,"Among the names mentioned by sources in touch with the Trump transition are Kevin Warsh, who served for five years on the bank’s board of governors and advised Trump during his first term; as well as Trump’s former chief economist Kevin Hassett."
18,"In July, before Trump was elected, the Fed chair was asked whether he intended to serve out the remainder of his term, and he said, unequivocally, “Yes.”
 Trump has frequently aired frustrations with Powell and occasionally threatened to remove the Fed chair from his post, which no president has ever done."
19,"Trump has also criticized what he perceives as a lack of transparency by the Fed, which conducts its policy deliberations in private and releases the notes from those discussions weeks later."
20,CNN has reported that Trump aides have suggested he would like real-time release of those minutes and economic reports and for the meetings to be conducted on-camera.
21,"Trump’s fraught history with Powell
 Trump and Powell clashed several times during his first term, with the president-elect threatening to fire him from the post on several occasions."
22,"In 2018, Trump said he was considering replacing Powell with a new Fed chair after the central bank raised interest rates."
23,"A president, however, cannot easily remove a Fed chair once confirmed unless they break the law."
24,"After markets tanked at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman,” adding that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.”
 More recently, Trump also said the Fed chair is among the easiest jobs in the government."
25,"“You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘Let’s flip a coin,’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a god,” Trump said last month at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago."
26,President-elect Donald Trump appointed Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve in November 2017.
27,President Joe Biden reappointed him five years later for another term as Fed Chair that is set to expire in 2026.

 Trump also said his prior threats to remove Powell “because he was keeping the rates too high” caused the Fed chair to lower rates “too much.”

42,"However, the outlook for further rate cuts gets murkier following the re-election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States as some of the new policies by the Republican leader are expected to reverse or stall the slowdown in inflation."
43,"Fed is now expected to wrap up its rate-cutting cycle by the middle of next year, leaving the policy rate in the range of 3.75% to 4%, which is significantly above the roughly 2.9% level Fed officials projected as of September, suggested a Reuters report."

122,The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7.
123,Here's what economists expect.
124,"What to know about the interest rate cut expected from the Federal Reserve
 Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
 Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
 The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September."
125,"The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet."
126,That would bring the federal funds rate — the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money — down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.
127,"With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic."
128,High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.
129,"If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say."
130,"The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers."
131,"""Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email."
132,"""For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable."""
133,Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.
134,Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?
135,"Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet."
136,"""Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,"" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report."
137,Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025.
138,That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.
139,What time is the Fed rate decision?
140,The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m.
141,"ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m."
142,The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.
143,How will the election impact the Fed's decision?
144,The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former President Donald Trump to victory.
145,"Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, Powell has generally shied away from direct commentary on White House administrations."
146,"Instead, he has stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics."
147,"Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate."
148,"If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures."
149,How low will rates go in 2024?
150,The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting.
151,"That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades."
152,"But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate."
153,"Even so, borrowers should see some relief."
154,"Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz."
155,"""While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,"" he added."
156,"""Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill."""
157,Will mortgage rates drop?
158,"Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac."
159,That's up from a September low of 6.08%.
160,"Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment."
161,"Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election."
162,"""As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,"" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree."
163,U.S. stock indexes soared as investors priced in Federal Reserve's prospective rate cut following Donald Trump’s presidential win.
164,"The anticipation of economic growth due to Trump's policies spurred market confidence, though inflationary concerns and interest rate trajectories remain closely watched by traders and investors."
165,"In a sensational market rally, U.S. stock indexes soared on Thursday, driven by Donald Trump's successful presidential re-election campaign."
166,"Investors anticipated economic growth, banking on Trump's policy stances, while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest-rate decision."
167,"Traders have largely anticipated a 25-basis-point rate cut, but are keenly focused on the central bank's commentary, as it holds implications for future monetary easing."
168,Market enthusiasm was bolstered by potential corporate tax reductions and deregulations under Trump's administration.
169,"Despite soaring optimism, some sectors faced declines following the surge."
170,"Financials edged down with prominent losses in JPMorgan Chase, while tech shares like Qualcomm exhibited gains."
171,"Meanwhile, rising bond yields and looming inflation concerns suggest a complex economic landscape moving forward."

193,"The market’s main event, though, is coming later in the day."
194,Wall Street’s nearly consensus expectation is that the Fed will cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.
195,The central bank began its rate-cutting campaign in September as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.
196,"A report on Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits, though the number was what economists expected."
197,"A separate preliminary report said U.S. workers improved their productivity during the summer, which can help keep a lid on inflation, but not by quite as much as economists expected."

199,"Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say would drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth."
200,Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to interest rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that.

211,"Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan."
212,That would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
213,"But the impact may be less drastic than feared, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report."
214,"“We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months –- any drag from potential Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year,” Huang said."
215,"In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.37% from 4.44% late Wednesday."

466,"Yet the Fed's future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump's economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary."
467,"His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed's policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank's interest rate decisions."
468,"The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference."
469,"Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again."
470,"The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening."
471,"Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation."
472,Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September.
473,"The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting."
474,"The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate."

476,"In what Wall Street has called the “Trump trade,” stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged."
477,"Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed."
478,"Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation."

 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, a decision that may seem a footnote given the uncertain economic terrain the central bank may soon be navigating under a second Trump administration."
509,Former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s return-to-office victory in Tuesday’s U.S. election and possible GOP control of both houses of Congress puts into play policy changes from tariffs to tax cuts to stifled immigration that could rewrite the outlook for economic growth and inflation Fed policy-makers had expected to face next year.
510,It may take months for the proposals to evolve and work through Congress even under full Republican control.
511,"But bond yields continued their recent rise in the wake of Tuesday’s results, and investors now expect the Fed will end up cutting interest rates less than previously anticipated as they take stock of a new economic regime that may mean higher federal deficits, higher growth, and higher inflation in the short run, and also come with longer-term risks."
512,"“You can see over time, the direction of budget deficits, tariffs … can become a problem” for the Fed to manage, said TSLombard Chief U.S."
513,Economist Steven Blitz.
514,"After having free rein to raise interest rates to fight inflation in a strong economy, the central bank may end up “in second position” keeping up with shifts in trade and global capital flows triggered by administration policies, facing both rising prices and pressure to keep unemployment low, Blitz said."
515,"Trump in his first term was open in calling for low interest rates, eventually branding Fed Chair Jerome Powell an “enemy” because of rate hikes he thought were unnecessarily stifling growth, a turbulent background to a relationship that will be closely watched in coming months."
516,"Trump promoted then-Fed Governor Powell to lead the Fed in 2018, and Powell was reappointed by President Joe Biden to a second term that runs through May 2026, which Powell has said he intends to complete."
517,"The Fed is widely anticipated to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday to a range between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent, a well-broadcast follow-up to the half-point reduction approved in September."
518,"Market confidence in what happens next, however, has begun to weaken, with the Fed now expected to end its cutting cycle as soon as the middle of next year with a policy rate ending in the 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent range."
519,That is a full percentage point above the roughly 2.9 per cent level Fed officials projected as of September.
520,"It is also well above the policy rate that caused Trump to erupt against the Fed in his first term, when the Fed’s benchmark rate peaked at around 2.4 per cent."
521,But monetary policy has been tightened and is being kept tight to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 per cent target – a process of “disinflation” the Fed feels is not yet complete and which Trump may want to see continue given how big a role rising prices played in the campaign.
522,"Yet the impact of Trump’s promised suite of economic policies could be difficult for the central bank to parse if tariffs start to shift global supply patterns with an uncertain impact on prices, growth and jobs, and various tax cuts are rolled out with a similarly hard-to-predict impacts on incomes, consumer demand, and government deficits."
523,"Fed officials ahead of the election noted that they don’t set monetary policy in reaction to proposals from any administration, but take fiscal and regulatory decisions as a “given” and only respond to the economic outcomes those decisions generate."
524,"They’ve been here with Trump before, raising rates in 2018 as his tax cuts led to unexpectedly strong growth and, from the Fed’s perspective, rising inflation risk, and cutting them in 2019 as his tariffs wars dimmed global growth prospects."
525,That won’t make it any easier to predict.
526,"The Fed may cut on Thursday as expected, but “beyond this, the outlook has become murkier with the extent and timing of further cuts hinging on incoming data and Trump’s policy approach in 2025,” Macquarie economists David Doyle and Chinara Azizova wrote on Wednesday."
527,"Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."

543,Annual inflation as measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.
544,"Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump’s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026."
545,Such an increase would likely upend the future rate cuts the Fed had signaled in September.
546,"At that meeting, when the policymakers cut their key rate by an outsize half-point to about 4.9%, the officials said they envisioned two quarter-point rate reductions later in the year — one on Thursday and one in December — and then four additional rate cuts in 2025."
547,But investors now foresee rate cuts next year as increasingly unlikely.
548,"The perceived probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in January of next year fell Wednesday to just 28%, down from 41% on Tuesday and from nearly 70% a month ago, according to futures prices monitored by CME FedWatch."
549,"The jump in borrowing costs for things like mortgages and car loans, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates."
550,"The economy grew at a solid annual rate of just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers — rose strongly in the July-September quarter."
551,"At the same time, companies have reined in hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs."
552,Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market.
553,"But if economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its interest rate cuts."

 The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises following the election of Donald Trump as the next US president."
574,The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president.
575,"""They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down, and not say anything all that new,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust."
576,"Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one."
577,"Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes."
578,"And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, or those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions."
579,"Fed watchers expect central bank chairman Jerome Powell to forge a consensus around a small cut, following a jumbo-sized reduction of 50 basis points in September."
580,"Powell will then face questions at a press conference about the election outcome, and what it could mean for his tenure as chair as well as the future of central bank policy making."

 Reporters are sure to pepper him with questions on how Trump’s promises of broad tariffs and immigration deportations could impact the economy, the deficit and inflation — and thus the path for monetary policy going forward."
583,"There are concerns that Trump's policies could push up prices and wages, making the Fed's job of getting inflation down to its 2% target more challenging."
584,The Fed chair will likely deflect on the impact of any new administration policies and argue the Fed decided to cut rates again to sustain the strong performance of the US economy as inflation continues to moderate.
585,"Powell will also likely emphasize, as he has all year long, that politics do not factor into the decision making of Fed policymakers."
586,It is not yet known what the election means for Powell himself.
587,"With his term atop the central bank ending in May 2026, the next president will also be able to choose the next face of US monetary policy."
588,"Trump has been clear, in spite of initially elevating Powell to his current perch, that no third term will be in the offing if he wins."
589,And Trump loyalists have already been jockeying for months as a result.

 The Federal Reserve is expected to announce Thursday it is cutting interest rates, a decision that comes just two days after a divisive and historic US presidential election."
609,The central bank is widely expected to move its benchmark interest rate lower by a quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
610,The move comes as inflation remains on a downward trend while the job market continues to lose momentum.
611,"Investors will be listening closely Thursday afternoon to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his traditional post-meeting press conference for any clues on the pace of future rate cuts, given the policies touted by President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House for a second term."
612,"Recent data shows the US economy remains on solid footing, but the Fed is nonetheless paring back rates because borrowing costs remain at restrictively high levels, according to Fed officials."
613,"While that has helped rein in price pressures, it also puts the job market in jeopardy."
614,"Officials lowered rates in September for the first time in more than four years, opting for a large half-point cut instead of the more traditional quarter-point size."
615,Powell said the bold move in September was a sign of the central bank’s commitment to maintaining the labor market’s strength.
616,"With the rate-cutting cycle now in full swing, the Fed is bringing rates on a journey back to the so-called neutral rate of interest — a level of rates that neither stimulates nor dampens the economy, since it seems like America’s economy is in a rare sweet spot where inflation is at bay, with the job market on solid ground."
617,"Such a scenario is known as a soft landing, and now the Fed’s job is to maintain that status."
618,"But, despite September’s big rate cut, some officials have said there isn’t any haste to cut rates further."
619,"“I’m not in a rush to get to neutral,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last month at an event in Jackson, Mississippi."
620,"“We must get inflation back to our 2% target, and I don’t want us to get to a place where inflation stalls out because we haven’t been restrictive for long enough."
621,"So I’m going to be patient.”
 Still, rate cuts are expected to stretch through 2025, even during a Trump presidency, according to economists."
622,"Powell, whose term ends in 2026, will likely be peppered with questions from reporters Thursday on what a second Trump term would mean for the Fed’s thinking on future rate cuts — and its independence as an institution."
623,"He will likely not answer those questions directly, economists say."
624,"A paradox of weaker hiring and strong spending
 Fed officials are making sense of mixed signals about the US economy and its direction."
625,"On one hand, there’s evidence that America’s job market has continued to lose momentum in recent months."
626,"Job openings, a proxy for labor demand, fell in September back to pre-pandemic levels as the rate of hiring continued to hover at levels not seen since 2014, excluding the steep drop in the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic."
627,"The October jobs report was difficult to interpret because figures were skewed by the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and labor strikes, but it came below expectations, which factored in those disruptions."
628,"On the other hand, Americans have continued to open their wallets, fueling strong economic growth."
629,"The US economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, driven by strong consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic output."
630,"Businesses also continued to invest in the July-through-September period, according to government data, and the stock market’s epic rally has proven resilient."
631,Major stock indexes reached record highs Wednesday after news of Trump defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.
632,"“The data has given a little bit for everyone,” said Felipe Villarroel, portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management."
633,“But the economy overall is doing well.
634,"The labor market just seems to be cooling off at the margins.”
 But the one thing that’s clear is that inflation has continued to ease — now just a hair away from the Fed’s 2% target."
635,"The Fed aims to keep inflation at that level “on a sustainable basis,” meaning inflation has to hover closely around 2% for an extended period."
636,"The Fed will have to manage Trump and his policies
 Trump’s election comes with massive implications for the US economy in the coming years — and possibly for the Fed itself."
637,"The former president backs tax cuts, stiff across-the-board tariffs, mass deportations and deregulation, but he hasn’t provided many details on how he plans to carry out those plans."
638,"Trump’s agenda has been described as inflationary by many economists, CNN previously reported."
639,The Fed takes into account how the laws and policies enacted by the White House and Capitol Hill affect the US economy.
640,It’s not clear exactly when the Fed will start baking Trump’s proposed policies in to their economic projections.
641,Officials also frequently mention that their decisions on interest rates are guided by economic data.
642,"But since Trump’s economic vision could eventually stoke inflation, that could mean the Fed delivers fewer rate cuts in the coming years."
643,"Another major question for the Fed in a second Trump term is on its decision-making independence, widely regarded by economists and investors as a successful feature of the institution."
644,The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump could push for the sitting US president to have a say in the Fed’s decision-making.
645,"When Arthur Burns served as Fed chair in the 1970s, his policy decisions were heavily influenced by then-President Richard Nixon, who pressed the Fed to stimulate the economy even when it was apparent that price pressures were brewing."
646,"That capitulation to the sitting president’s wishes, and disregard to economic data, entrenched a painful era of high inflation that lasted from 1965 to 1982, known as “the Great Inflation,” former Fed chair Ben Bernanke wrote in a 2022 book about monetary policy."
647,The Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month to try to ease inflationary pressures.
648,The Federal Reserve is set to cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month on Thursday in an effort to further ease inflationary pressures that have concerned American consumers and played a role in shaping the recent U.S. election results.

650,"However, President-elect Donald Trump's proposals have raised concerns about potential inflationary pressures, complicating the central bank's decision-making process."
651,"Trump's economic agenda includes widespread tariffs, higher taxes on imports, and large-scale deportations."

 Can Trump Influence Fed Decisions?"
657,"The central bank has long defended its autonomy, stressing that decisions on interest rates should be driven by economic data, not political pressure."
658,"However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he believes the Fed should take his economic policies into account."
659,"During his first term, Trump frequently criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in particular when the central bank raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation."
660,"Trump's vocal discontent raises the specter of political interference in monetary policy, a concern that could continue to shape the Fed's actions in the coming years."
661,"While growth remains solid, with the economy expanding at a rate just under three percent over the last six months, other signs are more concerning."

 Why Will Interest Rates Go Down?"
668,"Fed officials, including Powell, indicated that the latest rate cuts are designed to support the labor market, yet there is growing uncertainty about whether such moves will continue to yield results if inflation pressures mount again."
669,"With borrowing costs rising on everything from mortgages to car loans, some analysts fear that the Fed's efforts to reduce interest rates may not have the desired affect on consumer behavior if longer-term borrowing costs remain elevated."
670,"Since the Fed's September rate cut, Treasury yields have surged, reflecting investor expectations of stronger economic growth, rising inflation, and potentially larger federal budget deficits under President Donald Trump."
671,"This phenomenon—referred to on Wall Street as the ""Trump trade""—has led to higher borrowing costs, which in turn has dampened the intended effect of the Fed's rate reductions."
672,What Happens if Inflation Rises Again?
673,"Trump's proposed trade policies, including a 10 percent tariff on all imports and additional taxes on Chinese and Mexican goods, could reignite inflation."
674,"Economists estimate that such measures could push inflation back up to 2.75 percent or even 3 percent by mid-2026, according to Goldman Sachs."
675,"This would represent a significant shift, as inflation has been relatively stable at 2.1 percent in recent months, based on the Fed's preferred gauge."
676,"Such an increase would likely alter the Fed's path, making it less likely that the central bank will continue with its rate-cutting cycle."
677,Markets are increasingly pricing out the possibility of further rate cuts in 2025.
678,"As of Wednesday, futures prices suggest only a 28 percent chance of a rate cut in January 2025, a sharp decline from nearly 70 percent a month ago."
679,"The Fed's dilemma is now a balancing act: while the economy shows signs of resilience, including strong consumer spending, there are growing concerns that additional rate cuts could overstimulate the economy, reignite inflation, and potentially undercut the central bank's own policy objectives."
680,"If inflation begins to rise again, the Fed may face increasing pressure to halt or reverse its rate cuts."
681,"For now, the central bank will likely proceed with its Thursday rate cut, but how much further it will go in reducing borrowing costs in 2025 remains uncertain."

 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly inclined to allow Jerome Powell to complete his term as Federal Reserve Chair."
683,"Although Trump's decision is not final, his current stance aligns with the consensus of his economic team that Powell should remain in his position until his term ends in 2026."
684,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly inclined to let Jerome Powell finish his term as chair of the Federal Reserve, according to sources from inside Trump's camp speaking to CNN."
685,"Although Trump has not finalized his decision, the prevailing sentiment among his economic team is that Powell should continue leading the central bank."
686,"Powell's term is scheduled to expire in May 2026, giving him ample time to contribute to the Federal Reserve's ongoing policies and strategies under Trump's influence."
687,(With inputs from agencies.)
688,"President-elect Donald Trump is likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump requesting anonymity to describe private conversations."
689,"Washington CNN —
 President-elect Donald Trump remains likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump who requested anonymity to describe private conversations."
690,"The adviser cautioned that Trump could always change his mind, but his present view — and that of Trump’s economic team — is that Powell should remain atop the central bank as it pursues its policy of cutting interest rates."
691,Trump in July told Bloomberg he had intended to keep Powell in his role at least for the duration of his term.
692,"Still, Powell was peppered with questions about his job security during his first post-election press conference Thursday."
693,Powell issued a terse “No” in response to a question about whether he would leave his Fed post before his term is up if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to.
694,Powell later clarified that he believes Trump cannot fire him.
695,"”Not permitted under the law,” Powell said."
696,"Trump appointed Powell, a Republican former private equity executive who served on the central bank’s governing board, to its top spot in 2018."
697,President Joe Biden reappointed him to a second four-year term.
698,"Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs alum who served as economic policy director during Trump’s first administration, is said to want the job, but former Trump officials have said the fact that Cohn resigned in protest over Trump’s steel tariffs makes it highly unlikely he’d get it."
699,"Among the names mentioned by sources in touch with the Trump transition are Kevin Warsh, who served for five years on the bank’s board of governors and advised Trump during his first term; as well as Trump’s former chief economist Kevin Hassett."
700,"In July, before Trump was elected, the Fed chair was asked whether he intended to serve out the remainder of his term, and he said, unequivocally, “Yes.”
 Trump has frequently aired frustrations with Powell and occasionally threatened to remove the Fed chair from his post, which no president has ever done."
701,"Trump has also criticized what he perceives as a lack of transparency by the Fed, which conducts its policy deliberations in private and releases the notes from those discussions weeks later."
702,CNN has reported that Trump aides have suggested he would like real-time release of those minutes and economic reports and for the meetings to be conducted on-camera.
703,"Trump’s fraught history with Powell
 Trump and Powell clashed several times during his first term, with the president-elect threatening to fire him from the post on several occasions."
704,"In 2018, Trump said he was considering replacing Powell with a new Fed chair after the central bank raised interest rates."
705,"A president, however, cannot easily remove a Fed chair once confirmed unless they break the law."
706,"After markets tanked at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman,” adding that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.”
 More recently, Trump also said the Fed chair is among the easiest jobs in the government."
707,"“You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘Let’s flip a coin,’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a god,” Trump said last month at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago."
708,President-elect Donald Trump appointed Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve in November 2017.
709,President Joe Biden reappointed him five years later for another term as Fed Chair that is set to expire in 2026.

 Trump also said his prior threats to remove Powell “because he was keeping the rates too high” caused the Fed chair to lower rates “too much.”
 While the Fed chair has the most clout at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, they are not the only official to determine where interest rates should be."
711,At every monetary policy meeting there are 11 other Fed officials who vote on interest rate moves.
712,The Federal Reserve is confident that inflation is nearing its 2% target and may cut its benchmark rate by 25 bps.

716,"This time, analysts and investors are pencilling in a smaller rate cut of 25 bps."
717,"Apart from the announcement of the rate decision, investors across the globe will be keenly eyeing Powell’s commentary on the economic outlook."

724,"However, the outlook for further rate cuts gets murkier following the re-election of Donald Trump as the next President of the United States as some of the new policies by the Republican leader are expected to reverse or stall the slowdown in inflation."
725,"Fed is now expected to wrap up its rate-cutting cycle by the middle of next year, leaving the policy rate in the range of 3.75% to 4%, which is significantly above the roughly 2.9% level Fed officials projected as of September, suggested a Reuters report."
726,What Happened at September Fed meeting?
727,"During its September meeting, US Federal Reserve officials cut rates by 50 bps for the first time since the pandemic."
728,"Further, the Fed officials indicated that they expect the interest rate to decrease by another 50 basis points by the end of this year, followed by a full 1% reduction in 2025, and a final 0.5% cut in 2026, bringing the rate to a range of 2.75% to 3.00%."

804,The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7.
805,Here's what economists expect.
806,"What to know about the interest rate cut expected from the Federal Reserve
 Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
 Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
 The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September."
807,"The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet."
808,That would bring the federal funds rate — the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money — down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.
809,"With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic."
810,High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.
811,"If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say."
812,"The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers."
813,"""Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email."
814,"""For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable."""
815,Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.
816,Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?
817,"Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet."
818,"""Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,"" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report."
819,Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025.
820,That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.
821,What time is the Fed rate decision?
822,The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m.
823,"ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m."
824,The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.
825,How will the election impact the Fed's decision?
826,The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former President Donald Trump to victory.
827,"Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, Powell has generally shied away from direct commentary on White House administrations."
828,"Instead, he has stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics."
829,"Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate."
830,"If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures."
831,How low will rates go in 2024?
832,The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting.
833,"That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades."
834,"But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate."
835,"Even so, borrowers should see some relief."
836,"Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz."
837,"""While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,"" he added."
838,"""Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill."""
839,Will mortgage rates drop?
840,"Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac."
841,That's up from a September low of 6.08%.
842,"Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment."
843,"Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election."
844,"""As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,"" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree."
845,U.S. stock indexes soared as investors priced in Federal Reserve's prospective rate cut following Donald Trump’s presidential win.
846,"The anticipation of economic growth due to Trump's policies spurred market confidence, though inflationary concerns and interest rate trajectories remain closely watched by traders and investors."
847,"In a sensational market rally, U.S. stock indexes soared on Thursday, driven by Donald Trump's successful presidential re-election campaign."
848,"Investors anticipated economic growth, banking on Trump's policy stances, while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest-rate decision."
849,"Traders have largely anticipated a 25-basis-point rate cut, but are keenly focused on the central bank's commentary, as it holds implications for future monetary easing."

851,"Despite soaring optimism, some sectors faced declines following the surge."

1139,How the day unfolded.
1140,"5.09PM – Nov 8, 2024
 Thanks very much for reading our live coverage of the US election."
1141,"Here are the biggest developments of the day:
 Trump’s win puts focus on immigration enforcement: Donald Trump recaptured the White House after promising policies that included a militarised, mass deportation of undocumented immigrants – a costly undertaking that would probably face immediate legal and logistic challenges."
1142,Donald Trump to ‘rip off band-aid’ in massive tax overhaul: The president-elect is planning to push aggressive taxation cuts and steep tariffs through Congress when he takes office.
1143,"Powell ready to defend the Fed against Trump: US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump, saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other officials."
1144,Trump calls new chief of staff ‘ice maiden’: The president-elect had mentioned Susie Wiles several times in his victory speech.

1146,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory."
1147,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory."
1148,"Yet the Fed's future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump's economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary."
1149,"His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed's policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank's interest rate decisions."
1150,"The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference."
1151,"Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again."
1152,"The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening."
1153,"Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation."
1154,Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September.
1155,"The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting."
1156,"The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate."
1157,"Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump."
1158,"In what Wall Street has called the “Trump trade,” stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged."
1159,"Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed."
1160,"Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation."

 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, a decision that may seem a footnote given the uncertain economic terrain the central bank may soon be navigating under a second Trump administration."
1191,Former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s return-to-office victory in Tuesday’s U.S. election and possible GOP control of both houses of Congress puts into play policy changes from tariffs to tax cuts to stifled immigration that could rewrite the outlook for economic growth and inflation Fed policy-makers had expected to face next year.
1192,It may take months for the proposals to evolve and work through Congress even under full Republican control.
1193,"But bond yields continued their recent rise in the wake of Tuesday’s results, and investors now expect the Fed will end up cutting interest rates less than previously anticipated as they take stock of a new economic regime that may mean higher federal deficits, higher growth, and higher inflation in the short run, and also come with longer-term risks."
1194,"“You can see over time, the direction of budget deficits, tariffs … can become a problem” for the Fed to manage, said TSLombard Chief U.S."
1195,Economist Steven Blitz.
1196,"After having free rein to raise interest rates to fight inflation in a strong economy, the central bank may end up “in second position” keeping up with shifts in trade and global capital flows triggered by administration policies, facing both rising prices and pressure to keep unemployment low, Blitz said."
1197,"Trump in his first term was open in calling for low interest rates, eventually branding Fed Chair Jerome Powell an “enemy” because of rate hikes he thought were unnecessarily stifling growth, a turbulent background to a relationship that will be closely watched in coming months."
1198,"Trump promoted then-Fed Governor Powell to lead the Fed in 2018, and Powell was reappointed by President Joe Biden to a second term that runs through May 2026, which Powell has said he intends to complete."
1199,"The Fed is widely anticipated to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday to a range between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent, a well-broadcast follow-up to the half-point reduction approved in September."
1200,"Market confidence in what happens next, however, has begun to weaken, with the Fed now expected to end its cutting cycle as soon as the middle of next year with a policy rate ending in the 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent range."
1201,That is a full percentage point above the roughly 2.9 per cent level Fed officials projected as of September.
1202,"It is also well above the policy rate that caused Trump to erupt against the Fed in his first term, when the Fed’s benchmark rate peaked at around 2.4 per cent."
1203,But monetary policy has been tightened and is being kept tight to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 per cent target – a process of “disinflation” the Fed feels is not yet complete and which Trump may want to see continue given how big a role rising prices played in the campaign.
1204,"Yet the impact of Trump’s promised suite of economic policies could be difficult for the central bank to parse if tariffs start to shift global supply patterns with an uncertain impact on prices, growth and jobs, and various tax cuts are rolled out with a similarly hard-to-predict impacts on incomes, consumer demand, and government deficits."
1205,"Fed officials ahead of the election noted that they don’t set monetary policy in reaction to proposals from any administration, but take fiscal and regulatory decisions as a “given” and only respond to the economic outcomes those decisions generate."
1206,"They’ve been here with Trump before, raising rates in 2018 as his tax cuts led to unexpectedly strong growth and, from the Fed’s perspective, rising inflation risk, and cutting them in 2019 as his tariffs wars dimmed global growth prospects."
1207,That won’t make it any easier to predict.
1208,"The Fed may cut on Thursday as expected, but “beyond this, the outlook has become murkier with the extent and timing of further cuts hinging on incoming data and Trump’s policy approach in 2025,” Macquarie economists David Doyle and Chinara Azizova wrote on Wednesday."
1209,"Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."
1210,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."

1224,This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate.
1225,Annual inflation as measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.
1226,"Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump’s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026."
1227,Such an increase would likely upend the future rate cuts the Fed had signaled in September.
1228,"At that meeting, when the policymakers cut their key rate by an outsize half-point to about 4.9%, the officials said they envisioned two quarter-point rate reductions later in the year — one on Thursday and one in December — and then four additional rate cuts in 2025."
1229,But investors now foresee rate cuts next year as increasingly unlikely.
1230,"The perceived probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in January of next year fell Wednesday to just 28%, down from 41% on Tuesday and from nearly 70% a month ago, according to futures prices monitored by CME FedWatch."
1231,"The jump in borrowing costs for things like mortgages and car loans, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates."
1232,"The economy grew at a solid annual rate of just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers — rose strongly in the July-September quarter."
1233,"At the same time, companies have reined in hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs."
1234,Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market.
1235,"But if economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its interest rate cuts."

1256,The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president.
1257,"""They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down, and not say anything all that new,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust."
1258,"Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one."
1259,"Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes."
1260,"And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, or those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions."
1261,"Fed watchers expect central bank chairman Jerome Powell to forge a consensus around a small cut, following a jumbo-sized reduction of 50 basis points in September."
1262,"Powell will then face questions at a press conference about the election outcome, and what it could mean for his tenure as chair as well as the future of central bank policy making."

 Reporters are sure to pepper him with questions on how Trump’s promises of broad tariffs and immigration deportations could impact the economy, the deficit and inflation — and thus the path for monetary policy going forward."
1265,"There are concerns that Trump's policies could push up prices and wages, making the Fed's job of getting inflation down to its 2% target more challenging."
1266,The Fed chair will likely deflect on the impact of any new administration policies and argue the Fed decided to cut rates again to sustain the strong performance of the US economy as inflation continues to moderate.
1267,"Powell will also likely emphasize, as he has all year long, that politics do not factor into the decision making of Fed policymakers."
1268,It is not yet known what the election means for Powell himself.
1269,"With his term atop the central bank ending in May 2026, the next president will also be able to choose the next face of US monetary policy."
1270,"Trump has been clear, in spite of initially elevating Powell to his current perch, that no third term will be in the offing if he wins."
1271,And Trump loyalists have already been jockeying for months as a result.
1272,"Most of the names include figures who have surrounded Trump for years on economic policy — from former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who was on the shortlist last time, to Kevin Hassett, who worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Trump."

1290,"Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve is expected to announce Thursday it is cutting interest rates, a decision that comes just two days after a divisive and historic US presidential election."
1291,The central bank is widely expected to move its benchmark interest rate lower by a quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
1292,The move comes as inflation remains on a downward trend while the job market continues to lose momentum.
1293,"Investors will be listening closely Thursday afternoon to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his traditional post-meeting press conference for any clues on the pace of future rate cuts, given the policies touted by President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House for a second term."
1294,"Recent data shows the US economy remains on solid footing, but the Fed is nonetheless paring back rates because borrowing costs remain at restrictively high levels, according to Fed officials."
1295,"While that has helped rein in price pressures, it also puts the job market in jeopardy."
1296,"Officials lowered rates in September for the first time in more than four years, opting for a large half-point cut instead of the more traditional quarter-point size."
1297,Powell said the bold move in September was a sign of the central bank’s commitment to maintaining the labor market’s strength.
1298,"With the rate-cutting cycle now in full swing, the Fed is bringing rates on a journey back to the so-called neutral rate of interest — a level of rates that neither stimulates nor dampens the economy, since it seems like America’s economy is in a rare sweet spot where inflation is at bay, with the job market on solid ground."
1299,"Such a scenario is known as a soft landing, and now the Fed’s job is to maintain that status."
1300,"But, despite September’s big rate cut, some officials have said there isn’t any haste to cut rates further."
1301,"“I’m not in a rush to get to neutral,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last month at an event in Jackson, Mississippi."
1302,"“We must get inflation back to our 2% target, and I don’t want us to get to a place where inflation stalls out because we haven’t been restrictive for long enough."
1303,"So I’m going to be patient.”
 Still, rate cuts are expected to stretch through 2025, even during a Trump presidency, according to economists."
1304,"Powell, whose term ends in 2026, will likely be peppered with questions from reporters Thursday on what a second Trump term would mean for the Fed’s thinking on future rate cuts — and its independence as an institution."
1305,"He will likely not answer those questions directly, economists say."
1306,"A paradox of weaker hiring and strong spending
 Fed officials are making sense of mixed signals about the US economy and its direction."
1307,"On one hand, there’s evidence that America’s job market has continued to lose momentum in recent months."
1308,"Job openings, a proxy for labor demand, fell in September back to pre-pandemic levels as the rate of hiring continued to hover at levels not seen since 2014, excluding the steep drop in the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic."
1309,"The October jobs report was difficult to interpret because figures were skewed by the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and labor strikes, but it came below expectations, which factored in those disruptions."
1310,"On the other hand, Americans have continued to open their wallets, fueling strong economic growth."
1311,"The US economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, driven by strong consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic output."
1312,"Businesses also continued to invest in the July-through-September period, according to government data, and the stock market’s epic rally has proven resilient."
1313,Major stock indexes reached record highs Wednesday after news of Trump defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.
1314,"“The data has given a little bit for everyone,” said Felipe Villarroel, portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management."
1315,“But the economy overall is doing well.
1316,"The labor market just seems to be cooling off at the margins.”
 But the one thing that’s clear is that inflation has continued to ease — now just a hair away from the Fed’s 2% target."
1317,"The Fed aims to keep inflation at that level “on a sustainable basis,” meaning inflation has to hover closely around 2% for an extended period."
1318,"The Fed will have to manage Trump and his policies
 Trump’s election comes with massive implications for the US economy in the coming years — and possibly for the Fed itself."
1319,"The former president backs tax cuts, stiff across-the-board tariffs, mass deportations and deregulation, but he hasn’t provided many details on how he plans to carry out those plans."
1320,"Trump’s agenda has been described as inflationary by many economists, CNN previously reported."
1321,The Fed takes into account how the laws and policies enacted by the White House and Capitol Hill affect the US economy.
1322,It’s not clear exactly when the Fed will start baking Trump’s proposed policies in to their economic projections.
1323,Officials also frequently mention that their decisions on interest rates are guided by economic data.
1324,"But since Trump’s economic vision could eventually stoke inflation, that could mean the Fed delivers fewer rate cuts in the coming years."
1325,"Another major question for the Fed in a second Trump term is on its decision-making independence, widely regarded by economists and investors as a successful feature of the institution."
1326,The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump could push for the sitting US president to have a say in the Fed’s decision-making.
1327,"When Arthur Burns served as Fed chair in the 1970s, his policy decisions were heavily influenced by then-President Richard Nixon, who pressed the Fed to stimulate the economy even when it was apparent that price pressures were brewing."
1328,"That capitulation to the sitting president’s wishes, and disregard to economic data, entrenched a painful era of high inflation that lasted from 1965 to 1982, known as “the Great Inflation,” former Fed chair Ben Bernanke wrote in a 2022 book about monetary policy."
1329,The Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month to try to ease inflationary pressures.
1330,The Federal Reserve is set to cut its benchmark interest rate for the second consecutive month on Thursday in an effort to further ease inflationary pressures that have concerned American consumers and played a role in shaping the recent U.S. election results.
1331,"The move comes while inflation, which surged to record highs during the pandemic recovery, has shown signs of slowing."
1332,"However, President-elect Donald Trump's proposals have raised concerns about potential inflationary pressures, complicating the central bank's decision-making process."
1333,"Trump's economic agenda includes widespread tariffs, higher taxes on imports, and large-scale deportations."

 Can Trump Influence Fed Decisions?"
1339,"The central bank has long defended its autonomy, stressing that decisions on interest rates should be driven by economic data, not political pressure."
1340,"However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he believes the Fed should take his economic policies into account."
1341,"During his first term, Trump frequently criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in particular when the central bank raised interest rates in an effort to curb inflation."
1342,"Trump's vocal discontent raises the specter of political interference in monetary policy, a concern that could continue to shape the Fed's actions in the coming years."

 Why Will Interest Rates Go Down?"
1350,"Fed officials, including Powell, indicated that the latest rate cuts are designed to support the labor market, yet there is growing uncertainty about whether such moves will continue to yield results if inflation pressures mount again."
1351,"With borrowing costs rising on everything from mortgages to car loans, some analysts fear that the Fed's efforts to reduce interest rates may not have the desired affect on consumer behavior if longer-term borrowing costs remain elevated."
1352,"Since the Fed's September rate cut, Treasury yields have surged, reflecting investor expectations of stronger economic growth, rising inflation, and potentially larger federal budget deficits under President Donald Trump."
1353,"This phenomenon—referred to on Wall Street as the ""Trump trade""—has led to higher borrowing costs, which in turn has dampened the intended effect of the Fed's rate reductions."
1354,What Happens if Inflation Rises Again?
1355,"Trump's proposed trade policies, including a 10 percent tariff on all imports and additional taxes on Chinese and Mexican goods, could reignite inflation."
1356,"Economists estimate that such measures could push inflation back up to 2.75 percent or even 3 percent by mid-2026, according to Goldman Sachs."
1357,"This would represent a significant shift, as inflation has been relatively stable at 2.1 percent in recent months, based on the Fed's preferred gauge."
1358,"Such an increase would likely alter the Fed's path, making it less likely that the central bank will continue with its rate-cutting cycle."
1359,Markets are increasingly pricing out the possibility of further rate cuts in 2025.
1360,"As of Wednesday, futures prices suggest only a 28 percent chance of a rate cut in January 2025, a sharp decline from nearly 70 percent a month ago."
1361,"The Fed's dilemma is now a balancing act: while the economy shows signs of resilience, including strong consumer spending, there are growing concerns that additional rate cuts could overstimulate the economy, reignite inflation, and potentially undercut the central bank's own policy objectives."
1362,"If inflation begins to rise again, the Fed may face increasing pressure to halt or reverse its rate cuts."
1363,"For now, the central bank will likely proceed with its Thursday rate cut, but how much further it will go in reducing borrowing costs in 2025 remains uncertain."

1371,"Washington CNN —
 President-elect Donald Trump remains likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump who requested anonymity to describe private conversations."
1372,"The adviser cautioned that Trump could always change his mind, but his present view — and that of Trump’s economic team — is that Powell should remain atop the central bank as it pursues its policy of cutting interest rates."
1373,Trump in July told Bloomberg he had intended to keep Powell in his role at least for the duration of his term.
1374,"Still, Powell was peppered with questions about his job security during his first post-election press conference Thursday."
1375,Powell issued a terse “No” in response to a question about whether he would leave his Fed post before his term is up if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to.
1376,Powell later clarified that he believes Trump cannot fire him.
1377,"”Not permitted under the law,” Powell said."
1378,"Trump appointed Powell, a Republican former private equity executive who served on the central bank’s governing board, to its top spot in 2018."

1382,"In July, before Trump was elected, the Fed chair was asked whether he intended to serve out the remainder of his term, and he said, unequivocally, “Yes.”
 Trump has frequently aired frustrations with Powell and occasionally threatened to remove the Fed chair from his post, which no president has ever done."
1383,"Trump has also criticized what he perceives as a lack of transparency by the Fed, which conducts its policy deliberations in private and releases the notes from those discussions weeks later."
1384,CNN has reported that Trump aides have suggested he would like real-time release of those minutes and economic reports and for the meetings to be conducted on-camera.
1385,"Trump’s fraught history with Powell
 Trump and Powell clashed several times during his first term, with the president-elect threatening to fire him from the post on several occasions."
1386,"In 2018, Trump said he was considering replacing Powell with a new Fed chair after the central bank raised interest rates."
1387,"A president, however, cannot easily remove a Fed chair once confirmed unless they break the law."
1388,"After markets tanked at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman,” adding that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.”
 More recently, Trump also said the Fed chair is among the easiest jobs in the government."
1389,"“You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘Let’s flip a coin,’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a god,” Trump said last month at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago."

 Rate cut expected from Fed: What to know
 The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September."
1489,"The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet."
1490,That would bring the federal funds rate — the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money — down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.
1491,"With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic."
1492,High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.
1493,"If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say."
1494,"The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers."
1495,"""Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email."
1496,"""For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable."""
1497,Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.
1498,Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?
1499,"Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet."
1500,"""Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,"" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report."
1501,Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025.
1502,That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.
1503,What time is the Fed rate decision?
1504,The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m.
1505,"ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m."
1506,The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.
1507,How will the election impact the Fed's decision?
1508,The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former President Donald Trump to victory.
1509,"Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is likely to be asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, Powell has generally shied away from direct commentary on White House administrations."
1510,"Instead, he has stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics."
1511,"Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate."
1512,"If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures."
1513,How low will rates go in 2024?
1514,The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting.
1515,"That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades."
1516,"But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate."
1517,"Even so, borrowers should see some relief."
1518,"Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz."
1519,"""While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,"" he added."
1520,"""Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill."""
1521,Will mortgage rates drop?
1522,"Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac."
1523,That's up from a September low of 6.08%.
1524,"Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment."
1525,"Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election."
1526,"""As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,"" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree."
1527,U.S. stock indexes soared as investors priced in Federal Reserve's prospective rate cut following Donald Trump’s presidential win.

1531,"Traders have largely anticipated a 25-basis-point rate cut, but are keenly focused on the central bank's commentary, as it holds implications for future monetary easing."
1532,Market enthusiasm was bolstered by potential corporate tax reductions and deregulations under Trump's administration.
1533,"Despite soaring optimism, some sectors faced declines following the surge."

1564,Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to interest rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that.

1573,"And so we’ll have to see how things develop in the early stages of his presidency this time,” said Neil Newman, head of strategy for Astris Advisory Japan."
1574,Stocks rallied 2% in Hong Kong and 2.6% in Shanghai rallied after the Chinese government reported exports jumped in October at the fastest pace in more than two years.
1575,"Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan."
1576,That would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.
1577,"But the impact may be less drastic than feared, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report."
1578,"“We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months –- any drag from potential Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year,” Huang said."
1579,"In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.37% from 4.44% late Wednesday."

1581,Some of the other “Trump trades” that rocketed the day before also lost some of their juice.
1582,"Bank stocks were lagging the market, a day after soaring to some of the biggest gains on hopes for a stronger economy and lighter regulation."
1583,"Smaller U.S. stocks also weakened slightly, a day after charging ahead on expectations that Trump’s America-First priorities would benefit them more than the big multinationals in the S&P 500."

 Thanks very much for reading our live coverage of the US election."
1823,"Here are the biggest developments of the day:
 Trump’s win puts focus on immigration enforcement: Donald Trump recaptured the White House after promising policies that included a militarised, mass deportation of undocumented immigrants – a costly undertaking that would probably face immediate legal and logistic challenges."
1824,Donald Trump to ‘rip off band-aid’ in massive tax overhaul: The president-elect is planning to push aggressive taxation cuts and steep tariffs through Congress when he takes office.
1825,"Powell ready to defend the Fed against Trump: US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell made clear he’s ready to defend the central bank from political pressure following the re-election of Donald Trump, saying he wouldn’t resign if asked and insisting the incoming president doesn’t have the power to fire him or other officials."

1829,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump's presidential election victory."
1830,"Yet the Fed's future moves are now more uncertain in the aftermath of the election, given that Trump's economic proposals have been widely flagged as potentially inflationary."
1831,"His election has also raised the specter of meddling by the White House in the Fed's policy decisions, with Trump having proclaimed that as president he should have a voice in the central bank's interest rate decisions."
1832,"The Fed has long guarded its status as an independent institution able to make difficult decisions about borrowing rates, free from political interference."
1833,"Yet during his previous term in the White House, Trump publicly attacked Chair Jerome Powell after the Fed raised rates to fight inflation, and he may do so again."
1834,"The economy is also clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening."
1835,"Even so, consumer spending has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation."
1836,Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September.
1837,"The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting."
1838,"The average U.S. 30-year mortgage rate, for example, fell over the summer as the Fed signaled that it would cut rates, only to rise again once the central bank actually cut its benchmark rate."
1839,"Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President-elect Trump."
1840,"In what Wall Street has called the “Trump trade,” stock prices also soared Wednesday and the value of bitcoin and the dollar surged."
1841,"Trump had talked up cryptocurrencies during his campaign, and the dollar would likely benefit from higher rates and from the across-the-board increase in tariffs that Trump has proposed."
1842,"Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation."

 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, a decision that may seem a footnote given the uncertain economic terrain the central bank may soon be navigating under a second Trump administration."
1873,Former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s return-to-office victory in Tuesday’s U.S. election and possible GOP control of both houses of Congress puts into play policy changes from tariffs to tax cuts to stifled immigration that could rewrite the outlook for economic growth and inflation Fed policy-makers had expected to face next year.
1874,It may take months for the proposals to evolve and work through Congress even under full Republican control.
1875,"But bond yields continued their recent rise in the wake of Tuesday’s results, and investors now expect the Fed will end up cutting interest rates less than previously anticipated as they take stock of a new economic regime that may mean higher federal deficits, higher growth, and higher inflation in the short run, and also come with longer-term risks."
1876,"“You can see over time, the direction of budget deficits, tariffs … can become a problem” for the Fed to manage, said TSLombard Chief U.S."
1877,Economist Steven Blitz.
1878,"After having free rein to raise interest rates to fight inflation in a strong economy, the central bank may end up “in second position” keeping up with shifts in trade and global capital flows triggered by administration policies, facing both rising prices and pressure to keep unemployment low, Blitz said."
1879,"Trump in his first term was open in calling for low interest rates, eventually branding Fed Chair Jerome Powell an “enemy” because of rate hikes he thought were unnecessarily stifling growth, a turbulent background to a relationship that will be closely watched in coming months."
1880,"Trump promoted then-Fed Governor Powell to lead the Fed in 2018, and Powell was reappointed by President Joe Biden to a second term that runs through May 2026, which Powell has said he intends to complete."
1881,"The Fed is widely anticipated to reduce its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday to a range between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent, a well-broadcast follow-up to the half-point reduction approved in September."
1882,"Market confidence in what happens next, however, has begun to weaken, with the Fed now expected to end its cutting cycle as soon as the middle of next year with a policy rate ending in the 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent range."
1883,That is a full percentage point above the roughly 2.9 per cent level Fed officials projected as of September.
1884,"It is also well above the policy rate that caused Trump to erupt against the Fed in his first term, when the Fed’s benchmark rate peaked at around 2.4 per cent."
1885,But monetary policy has been tightened and is being kept tight to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 per cent target – a process of “disinflation” the Fed feels is not yet complete and which Trump may want to see continue given how big a role rising prices played in the campaign.
1886,"Yet the impact of Trump’s promised suite of economic policies could be difficult for the central bank to parse if tariffs start to shift global supply patterns with an uncertain impact on prices, growth and jobs, and various tax cuts are rolled out with a similarly hard-to-predict impacts on incomes, consumer demand, and government deficits."
1887,"Fed officials ahead of the election noted that they don’t set monetary policy in reaction to proposals from any administration, but take fiscal and regulatory decisions as a “given” and only respond to the economic outcomes those decisions generate."
1888,"They’ve been here with Trump before, raising rates in 2018 as his tax cuts led to unexpectedly strong growth and, from the Fed’s perspective, rising inflation risk, and cutting them in 2019 as his tariffs wars dimmed global growth prospects."
1889,That won’t make it any easier to predict.
1890,"The Fed may cut on Thursday as expected, but “beyond this, the outlook has become murkier with the extent and timing of further cuts hinging on incoming data and Trump’s policy approach in 2025,” Macquarie economists David Doyle and Chinara Azizova wrote on Wednesday."
1891,"Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."
1892,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials are poised Thursday to reduce their key interest rate for a second straight time, responding to a steady slowdown of the inflation pressures that exasperated many Americans and contributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory."

1907,Annual inflation as measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September.
1908,"Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump’s proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026."
1909,Such an increase would likely upend the future rate cuts the Fed had signaled in September.
1910,"At that meeting, when the policymakers cut their key rate by an outsize half-point to about 4.9%, the officials said they envisioned two quarter-point rate reductions later in the year — one on Thursday and one in December — and then four additional rate cuts in 2025."
1911,But investors now foresee rate cuts next year as increasingly unlikely.
1912,"The perceived probability of a rate cut at the Fed’s meeting in January of next year fell Wednesday to just 28%, down from 41% on Tuesday and from nearly 70% a month ago, according to futures prices monitored by CME FedWatch."
1913,"The jump in borrowing costs for things like mortgages and car loans, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates."
1914,"The economy grew at a solid annual rate of just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers — rose strongly in the July-September quarter."
1915,"At the same time, companies have reined in hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs."
1916,Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market.
1917,"But if economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its interest rate cuts."

1938,The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president.
1939,"""They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down, and not say anything all that new,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust."
1940,"Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one."

1942,"And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, or those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions."
1943,"Fed watchers expect central bank chairman Jerome Powell to forge a consensus around a small cut, following a jumbo-sized reduction of 50 basis points in September."
1944,"Powell will then face questions at a press conference about the election outcome, and what it could mean for his tenure as chair as well as the future of central bank policy making."

 Reporters are sure to pepper him with questions on how Trump’s promises of broad tariffs and immigration deportations could impact the economy, the deficit and inflation — and thus the path for monetary policy going forward."
1947,"There are concerns that Trump's policies could push up prices and wages, making the Fed's job of getting inflation down to its 2% target more challenging."
1948,The Fed chair will likely deflect on the impact of any new administration policies and argue the Fed decided to cut rates again to sustain the strong performance of the US economy as inflation continues to moderate.
1949,"Powell will also likely emphasize, as he has all year long, that politics do not factor into the decision making of Fed policymakers."
1950,It is not yet known what the election means for Powell himself.
1951,"With his term atop the central bank ending in May 2026, the next president will also be able to choose the next face of US monetary policy."
1952,"Trump has been clear, in spite of initially elevating Powell to his current perch, that no third term will be in the offing if he wins."
1953,And Trump loyalists have already been jockeying for months as a result.
1954,"Most of the names include figures who have surrounded Trump for years on economic policy — from former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who was on the shortlist last time, to Kevin Hassett, who worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Trump."

1979,Powell said the bold move in September was a sign of the central bank’s commitment to maintaining the labor market’s strength.
1980,"With the rate-cutting cycle now in full swing, the Fed is bringing rates on a journey back to the so-called neutral rate of interest — a level of rates that neither stimulates nor dampens the economy, since it seems like America’s economy is in a rare sweet spot where inflation is at bay, with the job market on solid ground."
1981,"Such a scenario is known as a soft landing, and now the Fed’s job is to maintain that status."
1982,"But, despite September’s big rate cut, some officials have said there isn’t any haste to cut rates further."

1984,"“We must get inflation back to our 2% target, and I don’t want us to get to a place where inflation stalls out because we haven’t been restrictive for long enough."

1991,"The October jobs report was difficult to interpret because figures were skewed by the temporary effects of recent hurricanes and labor strikes, but it came below expectations, which factored in those disruptions."
1992,"On the other hand, Americans have continued to open their wallets, fueling strong economic growth."
