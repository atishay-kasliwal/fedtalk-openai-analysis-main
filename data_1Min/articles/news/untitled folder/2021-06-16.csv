 Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said Thursday the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve will not have any significant impact on the Philippines because of the countrys solid and strong macroeconomic fundamentals."
56,Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said Thursday the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve will not have any significant impact on the Philippines because of the country’s solid and strong macroeconomic fundamentals.
57,“Any rate hike by the Fed will not be an immediate threat to the Philippines.
58,"Our GIR [gross international reserves] is healthy and interest rates now are at rock bottom,” Diokno said in an online news briefing."
59,“There will be a mid-term election in the US next year.
60,"I doubt the Fed chairman will ‘rock the boat’ amid the [ongoing] uncertainties during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Diokno said."
61,Diokno assured that local monetary authorities would be ready if the Fed decides to increase interest rates sooner.
62,"“We could do a lot of measures [on this],” he said."
63,Reports from the US indicated the Federal Reserve signaled an increase in interest rates earlier than previously expected amid the accelerating economic growth and inflation.
64,"After a two-day meeting, Fed officials left the main interest rate near zero and said the agency would continue to make massive purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds to support financial conditions and the recovery."
65,More Fed officials now see a rate hike happening next year or in 2023.
66,Most Fed officials in March expected no rate change through 2023.
67,"The Monetary Board of the BSP on May 12 kept the record-low benchmark interest rate at 2 percent, on expectation that inflation rate would remain manageable in the coming months."
68,"Diokno said Thursday the accommodative monetary policy and liquidity-enhancing measures of the BSP continued to support the domestic economy amid the health crisis by fostering favorable credit conditions and the orderly functioning of the government securities market.“With a manageable inflation outlook, the BSP continues to prioritize the use of monetary policy space to provide support to economic activity amid the pandemic as key sectors transition to the post-pandemic phase,” he said."
69,The BSP’s liquidity-easing measures released up to P2.2 trillion or equivalent to 12.1 percent of gross domestic product into the financial system.
70,"These measures included the 200-basis point cumulative reduction in policy rate in 2020, the reductions in reserve requirement ratios, purchases of government securities in the secondary market and provisional advances to the national government."
71,"Diokno said with ample liquidity in the financial system, domestic interest rates gradually declined over the past several months, even as lending activity remained affected by banks’ risk aversion due to concerns over asset quality, profitability and the broader economic outlook."
72,"“The prevailing stance of monetary policy remains anchored on the BSP’s assessment of a manageable outlook for inflation over the next two years,” he said."
73,“This outlook in turn is based on the continued predominant role of transitory supply-side factors in the inflation uptick in recent months.
74,"In addition, the extent of unused economic capacity amid the early stages of demand recovery partly mitigates the risk of near-term demand-driven pressures as well as second round-effects from supply-side inflation pressures,” he said."
75,"Diokno said with asset prices keeping in line with overall market fundamentals, the BSP remained on the lookout for signs of imbalances amid a low-interest rate environment and in anticipation of further demand recovery."
76,"“Looking ahead, the BSP shall remain vigilant to ensure that policy responses will neither lead to excessive inflation nor trigger financial stability risks, especially as economic recovery gets underway,” he said."

 The European Union raised 20 billion euros ($24 billion) from a 10-year bond on Tuesday in the largest-ever single-tranche institutional debt sale that saw near-record demand of 142 billion euros, taking a big step towards establishing itself as a major debt issuer.."
81,"The bond rallied sharply in the secondary market in further evidence of strong demand, with its yield - 0.086% at pricing - down 5 basis points to around 0.04% on Wednesday."
82,"The rally was similar to that following the EU’s first issuance last October backing the SURE unemployment scheme, a smaller support programme."
83,"With demand far above the deal size, much investor appetite was left unsatisfied, bankers involved with the deal said."
84,"“Given the particularly low (investor) allocations compared to normal, you’re going to get more follow-on demand than you would typically see,” one of the bankers said."
85,"It attracted such large demand at issuance even though the EU capped orders it considered from hedge funds, which, inflating their demand to secure better allocations, have been a major driver of large bond sale order books."
86,"Investors were keen to buy the first issuance of what will become a much more liquid funding programme than SURE, the bankers said."
87,The European Central Bank upholding accelerated bond purchases for the third quarter has also given investors confidence to buy into sizable debt sales.
88,"In the broader market, bond yields dipped as the focus was on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting."

91,"Germany’s 10-year yield, the euro area benchmark, was down slightly over one basis point to -0.243%, along with most other 10-year yields."

134,"While the Fed is not expected to make any policy changes or rate hikes at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, markets were on edge Wednesday morning."
135,"The Fed's ""cheap money"" strategy has been widely viewed as the catalyst for Wall Street's series of record highs over the past year."
136,"The Fed's benchmark lending rate currently stands at between 0 percent and 0.25 percent, and is expected to remain at that range until at least the end of 2024, according to the Fed's March economic projections."
137,"In remarks before Congress and in other economic forums, Powell has reiterated his commitment to the Fed's accommodative policy stance, emphasizing that the central bank is open to seeing inflation run slightly above its 2 percent target for a period of time — as long as that inflation remains ""transitory."""

143,"While the Fed could raise the interest rate in order to rein in that inflation, that would have a negative impact on the labor market, as companies tighten their hiring to keep costs down."
144,"The latest monthly jobs report shows an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent — higher than pre-pandemic levels, which were hovering at a half-century low of around 3.5 percent."
145,"""Employment is worse than the headline numbers suggest,"" McMillan said."
146,"""Job growth continues, but millions of people are still out of work, despite the labor shortage headlines."
147,"Since the Fed has a dual mandate — unemployment and inflation — that suggests it should indeed keep its focus on unemployment, rather than inflation."
148,"And that means continuing to provide monetary stimulus to help the real economy."""
149,"Powell, whose four-year tenure as chair ends in February, has repeatedly clarified that he would give plenty of notice before the central bank starts to withdraw its crisis-era support — ostensibly to prevent any “taper tantrum,” when markets were thrown into turmoil in 2013 after the Fed said it intended to scale back its bond purchasing."
150,"“I think this is going to be Powell's toughest conference in his career as chairman,” Dan North, senior economist at Euler Hermes North America, told NBC News."

 With U.S. inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic."
256,"Graphic: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook:

261,Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates.

 The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers’ views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024."
265,"U.S. job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving “transitory,” and hiring to accelerate as the nation’s economic reopening continues."
266,The Fed has laid out an explicit test for any rate hike - including the need for inflation to not just reach but exceed the central bank’s 2% target “for some time” in order to make up for years of inflation that was too low.
267,"The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed’s preferred inflation measure to 3.6%."
268,"While that was the highest in 13 years, it was only one monthly reading and driven by factors officials feel will fade over time."
269,"Still, the timing for the initial “liftoff” of rates could shift into 2023 if only two or three officials feel the improved outlook, or a too-fast-return of inflation, would warrant faster action - a change investors may read as particularly “hawkish.”
 Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. economist, Matthew Luzzetti, wrote last week that he felt it a “close call” whether the Fed’s updated “dot plot” of interest rate projections would advance an initial rate hike into next year, but that ultimately the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would see continued near-zero rates as more consistent with the path of the recovery and the management of the twin inflation and employment goals."
270,"“With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed’s transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed’s views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,” Luzzetti said."
271,"World stock markets treaded water near record highs on Wednesday as investors braced for any hawkish signals from the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, and oil prices hit their highest since April 2019 on recovering demand."

 A jump in consumer prices is sure to come up at a news conference on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve’s meeting."
421,Here is where inflation stands as the Fed meets.
422,"Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, is expected to continue predicting that inflation pressures will fade when he holds a news conference Wednesday afternoon."
423,"Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The Federal Reserve will release its June policy decision and newest economic projections at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, and investors will be scrutinizing its announcements for clues on whether the central bank’s thinking about inflation might be changing."
424,"Price gains have been coming in quicker than central bankers had expected when they last released economic projections in March, and that has invited questions about whether and when the Fed will need to begin removing its economic policy supports, which remain set to emergency mode."
425,Any tweaks to the Fed’s policy statement or estimates about the outlook will be closely watched.
426,"Economists generally expect Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to stick to the script when it comes to price increases: Predicting that inflation pressures will fade as the United States gets through a funky reopening period and noting that the central bank has the tools to deal with inflation if gains do last."
427,There are reasons to expect the bump to wane.
428,"Prices sank during lockdowns last year, making the year-over-year comparison look artificially big, and prices are rising now because demand is bouncing back faster than supply."
429,Officials expect that the bottlenecks restricting the supply of items like cars and airline tickets will clear up as things return to normal.

431,"Here are the inflation indicators the Fed is working with headed into its meeting: Personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred gauge: up 3.6 percent in April from the prior year, the fastest pace in 13 years."

435,"University of Michigan consumer inflation expectation for five years from now: moderated to 2.8 percent in preliminary June data, little changed from 2.7 percent at the start of 2021."
436,"Five-year, five-year forward inflation expectation rate, a market-based measure: appears to have stabilized around 2.3 percent after climbing sharply earlier this year."
437,"Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, inflation expectation for next year: 4 percent, up from 3 percent at the start of the year."
438,"New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, inflation expectation for three years from now: 3.6 percent, up from 3 percent at the start of the year."

440,"Officials have also aspired to lift inflation expectations, which had been drifting too low."

446,And it has a new top sponsor: TikTok.

449,Its splashy party drew such a crowd that hundreds of creators were left standing at the entrance.
450,"This year, the company’s presence will only be bigger."
451,"TikTok will bring many of the app’s top creators to appear at events, and an executive at the company will deliver the keynote address."
452,"Since its founding in 2010, VidCon has been an opportunity for creators to network with executives in entertainment and technology; source brand deals; socialize; and meet fans."
453,"Last year’s VidCon drew more than 75,000 attendees."
454,"In years past, YouTubers dominated the convention, but the creator economy has changed dramatically in the last year."
455,"A spokesperson from YouTube said that the company will maintain a large presence at this year’s event, which is scheduled to take place Oct. 21-24."
456,"“We prioritized the health and safety of our creators, fans and employees as we thoughtfully worked through our VidCon plans months ago,” the spokesperson wrote in an email."

 In an about-face, Lordstown Motors says it has enough money and will start building trucks."
458,"Credit... Megan Jelinger/Agence France-Presse—Getty Images A day after ousting two top executives, the electric truck start-up Lordstown Motors said on Tuesday that it was on track to start production in September even if it does not raise additional funding, contradicting what it told securities regulators just a week ago."
459,"In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Lordstown said it needed to raise more money and might not survive."
460,"Then, on Monday its founder and chief executive, Steve Burns, and the company’s chief financial officer resigned."
461,"But in a news conference hosted by the Detroit-based Automotive Press Association, the company’s new executive team presented a far more optimistic outlook without providing many details."
462,"Lordstown’s president, Rich Schmidt, said that the company would start making trucks at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in late September and that it had enough money to last until May 2022."
463,"He said the company would be able to make about 15,000 trucks over the next 24 months."
464,He also said the company was still actively seeking new funding to increase production.
465,"“It’s a new day at Lordstown Motors, and there is no and will be no disruption to our plans to start production,” the company’s new executive chairwoman, Angela Strand, said."
466,She had previously served as the lead independent director on Lordstown’s board.
467,"Lordstown’s stock had climbed to nearly $31 a share earlier this year, but fell to about $7 in May, after Mr. Burns acknowledged that the thousands of “pre-orders” the company had been touting were not binding orders."
468,"Some large orders the company had announced had also come from “influencers” who did not plan to buy the trucks themselves, the company said on Monday."
469,"Mr. Schmidt, who joined Lordstown in 2019 after a stint at Tesla, said on Tuesday that the company had “binding” orders for all the trucks the company is likely to make in 2021 and 2022."
470,"But he declined to disclose the total number, name specific customers or say whether they had paid deposits to secure their orders."
471,"“Those are firm orders,” Mr. Schmidt said."
472,“They have been reconfirmed last week.” Lordstown shares jumped more than 10 percent on Tuesday.
473,He said production would start in September even though the company’s Endurance truck has not passed all the required crash and engineering tests needed to be cleared for sale in the United States.
474,"Trucks that roll off its assembly line would be held until the testing is complete and then modified, if necessary, before being shipped to customers, a highly unusual practice in the auto industry."
475,Mr. Schmidt offered little detail on what prompted Mr. Burns’s departure.
476,About a dozen other senior executives were also let go on Monday.
477,Lordstown gained attention in 2019 when it agreed to buy a plant that General Motors was closing.
478,"The shutdown drew scorn from President Donald J. Trump, and G.M."
479,sold the plant to Lordstown for just $20 million.
480,Mr. Trump later hosted Mr. Burns at the White House.
481,"Lordstown plans to make a rugged, electric pickup truck for commercial customers like mining and construction businesses."
482,Mr. Burns had hoped the company would become the Tesla of the pickup market.
483,"But investors grew concerned about Lordstown’s prospects after a small investment firm, Hindenburg Research, published a report in March that raised questions about interest in the company’s trucks."

491,"Potentially buoying gold’s appeal for investors holding other currencies, the dollar index edged down slightly."
492,"Data on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May, while producer prices jumped by 6.6% year-on-year during the month, the largest gain since November 2010."
493,"This comes on the backdrop of recent data showing a spike in U.S. consumer prices, which have raised concerns over rising inflation rates."
494,"However, Fed officials have said rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings would stay in place for some time."
495,“The street is heavily positioned with the Fed in the transitory indication corner.
