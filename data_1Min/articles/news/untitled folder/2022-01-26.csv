 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as March, a key step in reversing its pandemic-era low-rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation."
4,"With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily, the Fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases, which have been intended to lower longer-term rates, in March."
5,"In a statement issued after its latest policy meeting, the Fed it “expects it will soon be appropriate” to raise rates."
6,"Though the statement didn’t specifically mention March, half the Fed’s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then, including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring."
7,"Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed his view, as he has before, that controlling inflation is vital to a strong job market."
8,"“We believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains,” Powell said, “is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability.”
 The Fed on Wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings, a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago."
9,"Some analysts expect the Fed to begin doing so as soon as July, a move that would contribute to tighter credit."
10,The central bank’s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — costlier over time.
11,"Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow consumer spending and hiring."
12,The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession.
13,"The central bank’s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the Fed will go to reverse its low-rate policies, which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years."
14,The broad S&P 500 index fell nearly 10% this month before rebounding slightly Wednesday.
15,"High inflation has also become a serious political threat to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, with Republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the November elections."
16,Yet Biden said last week that it was “appropriate” for Powell to adjust the Fed’s policies.
17,"And congressional Republicans have endorsed Powell’s plans to raise rates, providing the Fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit."
18,The Fed’s bond purchases have been intended to reduce longer-term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending.
19,Many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
20,"Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed’s December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases."
21,The impact of the reducing the Fed’s bond stockpile isn’t well known.
22,But the last time that the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018.
23,The S&P 500 stock index fell 20% in three months.
24,"By not replacing some of its bond holdings, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries."
25,"This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive
 Some analysts have said they aren’t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates."
26,All of which means the Powell Fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act.
27,"If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans."
28,"Modest drops in share prices, though, won’t likely affect the Fed’s thinking."
29,Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation.
30,Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively.
31,They argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring.
32,"In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure."
33,"This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation — consumer prices have surged 7% in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades — but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections."
34,"Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary."
35,"The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages — to apartment rents, for example — which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely."

37,"Mark Zuckerberg’s controversial cryptocurrency initiative is dead in the water amid resistance from the Federal Reserve — and Meta is now looking to sell off its crypto assets altogether, according to a report."
38,The Diem Association — a crypto project formerly known as “Libra” that has been backed by the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — planned to issue a so-called stablecoin that would have been pegged to the US dollar.
39,Backers of the stablecoins say they have the potential to transform global finance by offering the seamless transaction speeds of cryptocurrencies without the price volatility of bitcoin or ethereum.
40,"But from the moment that Meta and its partners unveiled plans for a stablecoin in 2019, the idea met resistance from regulators, who expressed concern about letting the scandal-plagued company control a chunk of the global financial system."
41,Zuckerberg defended the project in a contentious contentious Congressional hearing later that year.
42,"Despite lawmakers’ opposition, Diem and Silvergate Capital — a fintech bank that was planning to issue the stablecoin — had pushed forward with their plans until they met resistance from the Federal Reserve in 2021, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday."
43,"Following several rounds of talks, Fed officials told Silvergate in the summer of 2021 that the central bank could not guarantee that it would allow the Diem project to go forward, according to the report."
44,"Silvergate was then left with no way to issue the stablecoin, Bloomberg reported."
45,"The Federal Reserve said it could not guarantee that it would allow the Diem project to go forward, according to Bloomberg."

 Meta is now exploring selling its roughly one-third stake in Diem, according to the outlet."
47,"In addition to Meta, other partners in Diem include venture capital firms Andressen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, as well as Uber, Shopify and the Singaporean state fund Temasek."
48,"In November, a report issued by the US Treasury with contributions from the Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission called on Congress to crack down on issuers of stablecoins."
49,Backers of stablecoins say they have the potential to revolutionize finance.

 Since stablecoins can pose risks including “destabilizing runs, disruptions in the payment system, and concentration of economic power,” any entity that issues a stablecoin should be regulated like a bank, the agencies said."
51,"“Failure to act risks growth of payment stablecoins without adequate protection for users, the financial system, and the broader economy,” the report said."

202,"Some on Wall Street are worried that the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate
 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is seen delivering remarks on a screen as a trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, on Dec. 15, 2021.ANDREW KELLY/Reuters
 Wild volatility in the stock market this week has put heightened scrutiny on the Federal Reserve’s meeting Wednesday and whether the Fed will clarify just how fast it plans to tighten credit and potentially slow the economy."
203,"With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signal that it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession."
204,"To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March."
205,"And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds."
206,Investors fear there may be still more to come.
207,"Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate."
208,"There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect."
209,Another wild card – particularly for Wall Street – is the Fed’s bond holdings.
210,"As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120-billion a month."
211,"The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending."
212,Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
213,"Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed’s December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature – a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases."
214,"Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago."
215,The impact of reducing the Fed’s bond stockpile isn’t well known.
216,But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018.
217,The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20 per cent in three months.
218,"If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent, up from near zero."
219,The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing – from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit – more expensive.
220,"Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits."
221,"The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession."
222,Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly.
223,"The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday’s trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain."
224,"On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent."
225,"Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10 per cent – the level that investors define as a “correction.”

230,"Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, said that Wall Street has also been unnerved by the sharp jump in the inflation-adjusted interest rate on the 10-year Treasury."
231,"That rate has jumped by one-half a percentage point just this month, an unusually swift rise."

237,Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation.
238,Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively.
239,They argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn’t slow inflation in any case.
240,"In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure."
241,"This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation – consumer prices have surged 7 per cent in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades – but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections."
242,"Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary."
243,"The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages – to apartment rents, for example – which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely."

306,"In the two days ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting, U.S. markets were especially volatile; Monday had at one point the biggest slide since the pandemic began."
307,WASHINGTON — Wild volatility in the stock market this week has put heightened scrutiny on the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday and whether the Fed will clarify just how fast it plans to tighten credit and potentially slow the economy.
308,"With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signal that it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession."
309,"To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March."
310,"And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds."
311,Investors fear there may be still more to come.
312,"Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate."
313,"There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect."
314,Another wild card — particularly for Wall Street — is the Fed’s bond holdings.
315,"As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120 billion a month."
316,"The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending."
317,Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
318,"Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed's December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases."
319,"Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago."
320,The impact of reducing the Fed's bond stockpile isn't well known.
321,But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018.
322,The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20% in three months.
323,"If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, up from near zero."
324,The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — more expensive.
325,"Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits."
326,"The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession."
327,Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly.
328,"The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday's trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain."
329,"On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2%."
330,"Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10% — the level that investors define as a “correction.”
 Economists have forecast that when the Fed does start allowing some of its $8.8 trillion in bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet, it will do so at a pace of $100 billion a month."
331,"By not replacing some securities, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries."

353,"The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has lost more than 5% in two weeks, as rising bets on faster-than-expected monetary tightening and heightened tensions over Ukraine roiled global stock markets."
354,"Benchmarks in Taiwan and Korea have suffered with their large tech exposure, with the sector bearing the brunt of the selloff as bond yields rose."
355,"“Foreign investors seem to have started reducing risky assets as they gauge the Fed’s monetary tightening,” said Hyun Choi, head of equity at Baring Asset Management Korea Ltd. “Investors need time to get adjusted to the new environment of change in liquidity.”

442,His strategy worked through the 1990s but backfired badly with the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000.
443,"Following that market crash, Greenspan switched his central bank support to buying US mortgages."
444,"That fuelled a mortgage securities boom that went bust with the global financial crisis in 2008-09, which, in turn, prompted then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to implement his version of the “Greenspan put”."
445,"Since then, US central bank support of asset prices, in particular equity markets, has become entrenched in the system and been implemented by successive Fed chairs, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell."
446,"The policy has been especially good for America’s largest banks, which have earned record profits since 2008-09, private equity companies that have ridden high on cheap debt, and the 1 per cent of the US population that owns about a third of the country’s wealth."

 But the asset price inflation party is now on rocky ground."
448,With the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure running about 4.8 per cent – or double the rate experienced in the past decade – Powell is looking to raise official interest rates and wind back quantitative easing.
449,"Many in the market, including Jeremy Grantham and The Australian Financial Review’s Christopher Joye, smell an end to the Fed put and the possibility sharemarkets will tank by 50 per cent."
450,"But Powell’s options for removing the put are limited, according to Viktor Shvets, Macquarie’s equity strategist based in New York."
451,"Shvets says the Fed and other central banks don’t have much room in a “financialised” and leveraged world, which is not ready for the removal of fiscal and monetary supports."
452,"Advertisement
 He says the primary mandate of central banks is not employment or inflation; it is maintaining the stability of the “cloud of finance”, which is five to 10 times larger than underlying economies."
453,"“The Fed’s responsibility is to balance asset values that belong to the top 5 per cent, with the need to stimulate borrowing and consumption by the bottom 60 per cent [who own almost nothing], while keeping the diminishing middle relatively intact, without having all the required tools,” he says."
454,"“The Fed is not an arbiter but rather a ‘market’s mirror’, with investors watching the Fed and the Fed watching investors, understanding that modern economies require rolling asset bubbles to sustain what the ‘cloud of finance’ demands and societies view as appropriate growth rates.”
 Expansionary fiscal policies
 Shvets says that if the Fed wants to keep inflation “boiling” to benefit US households, it will have to maintain highly expansionary fiscal policies, supported by an accommodative monetary stance."
455,The alternative is a fiscal cliff of enormous proportions.
456,"Advertisement
 Using data from the International Monetary Fund, Shvets says the fiscal deficits in the US, Japan, eurozone and Britain will fall from 11 per cent of GDP in 2021 to a range between 5 and 6 per cent in 2023."
457,The absolute deficits are projected to fall from $US5 trillion ($7 trillion) in 2021 to $US2.6 trillion in 2022 and $US2.1 trillion in 2023.
458,"“In other words, investors are likely to witness around $US3 trillion of fiscal deficits removed over the next 18 months or so,” Shvets says."
459,"“At the same time, as fiscal policies are becoming more stringent, monetary policies are also turning the corner, and equally as aggressively.”
 Shvets says the withdrawal of support for the “cloud of finance” over the next 18 months could be extraordinary if central banks raise official interest rates and stop using their balance sheets to prop up asset prices."
460,"He says the central banks of the US, Japan, UK and eurozone pumped about $US8 trillion into financial markets in 2020 and another $US2.3 trillion last year."
461,"Advertisement
 “It seems likely, therefore, that at the very least, central banks would remove probably more than $US2 trillion, and potentially $US3 trillion, from global liquidity,” he says."
462,"“Hence, we continue to anticipate that, for G4 economies (US, UK, Japan and eurozone), the combination of fiscal and monetary tightening might be equivalent to withdrawing up to $US5 trillion to $US6 trillion of supports in a relatively short 18-month window."
463,"Transitory inflation spike
 “This is larger than the size of Japan’s GDP.”
 Shvets believes the inflation spike in the US is transitory, and it is a mistake to quote annual inflation numbers."
464,"“It is true that the inflationary spike was both stronger and more elongated than either economists or policymakers were anticipating,” he says."
465,"Advertisement
 “However, to quote annual numbers is meaningless, and on month-to-month or three months-to-three months – inflationary measures have already peaked."
466,"“There is a lot less inflation in the eurozone, China and Japan, while Anglo-Saxons are more inflationary because goods demand rebounded a lot more there than in the rest of the world."
467,"“Goods demand is running around 20 per cent above trend line in the US, while services demand is running at least 10 per cent below trend line."
468,"“Assuming that we progress from pandemic to endemic, goods demand will ease and services will improve, while supply of goods is already getting better – just look at ISM and other indices."
469,"Limited wages growth
 “The same applies to labour markets."
470,"There is absolutely no evidence that inflation is moving into wages in the eurozone, China and Japan, and even in the US it is still mostly impacting disrupted sectors."
471,"Advertisement
 “At the same time, labour participation in the US remains low, and there is at least another 3 million and possibly up to 8 million people who can enter the labour force."
472,"“If you think of consumer surveys, yes, immediate inflation expectations are high, but they come off over time, and neither 20- nor 30-year bond yields in the US signal any inflationary concerns – they’re stuck at just above 2 per cent."
473,"“In other words, bond markets are telling you that longer-term, they expect neither inflation nor growth."
474,"The same is true of five year-five year break evens, which remain anchored around 2 per cent.”
 Shvets says it is a mistake to look at economies as being disconnected from asset prices and market volatility."
475,"“The Fed’s mandate is not inflation or employment but ensuring that the inverted debt and wealth pyramid does not collapse, because if it does, it will massively derate both growth and inflation.”
 The arguments against the Fed put staying in place were put succinctly this week by economists at Nomura International Securities in New York – Aichi Amemiya, Robert Dent and Kenny Lee."
476,"Advertisement
 First, they said broad financial conditions remain accommodative and the Fed’s primary objective was to “normalise policy over coming months to ensure high inflation does not become entrenched, making a Fed put far less likely”."
477,"Second, the Fed wants to tighten conditions and is happy for its hawkish pivot to be priced into financial markets."
478,"This is happening, as shown by the spike in 30-year residential mortgages in the US from 3.1 per cent in December to 3.5 per cent in January."
479,"Third, several Federal Open Market Committee members have commented negatively on the elevated price-to-earnings ratios and sharemarket valuations."
480,"Fourth, excess savings, which are estimated at $US2.5 trillion, can be used to offset any wealth effect from falling share prices."
481,"Finally, the tightening in financial conditions before any rise in official interest rates may prompt the Fed to slow its course and reduce the likelihood of four rate increases in 2022."
482,"“While financial conditions play a role in the overall economic outlook, their ability to create another Fed put similar to what occurred over 2011-19 remains far more limited,” the Nomura economists said."
