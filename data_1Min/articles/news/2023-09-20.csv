 A comeback in thematic investing will take hold when the Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates potentially next year, Cathie Wood told Bloomberg TV in an interview on Wednesday."
20,"“I think we’re on the other side of that massive interest-rate increase, which did destroy a lot of performance,” Wood said."
21,"Indeed, Wood's exchange-traded funds suffered last year as many central banks across the globe ratcheted up borrowing costs to tame inflation."
22,"Since the start of 2023, though, most of the funds in her suite have turned in double-digit returns, with the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) climbing about 37% and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) up ~49%."
23,"“If anything, innovation gains traction during tough times,” Wood said, as quoted by Bloomberg."

33,"The yield, which moves inversely to the price, touched 2.751% on Tuesday, the highest since early March."
34,"""I think the move ... is primarily a breather or minor pre-Fed correction or adjustment following the increase seen in yields over the past few days,"" said Jussi Hiljanen, head of European rates strategy at lender SEB."
35,"The German 2-year bond yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, was down 2.5 bps at 3.262%."

47,The Fed is meeting today to decide whether to again raise rates as it battle inflation.
48,Here's what it means for interest rates and mortgages.
49,"What the August rise in inflation could mean for the economy
 What the August rise in inflation could mean
 What the August rise in inflation could mean
 The Federal Reserve is meeting today to decide its next move on interest rates, a policy that will impact millions of consumers and businesses that rely on loans, credit cards and other borrowing."
50,"The decision comes after the central bank has raised the federal funds rate 11 times since March 2022, pushing mortgage rates to their highest levels in decades and credit card APRs to record heights."
51,"The string of interest rate hikes reflects the Fed's efforts to douse the hottest inflation in four decades, which reached 9.1% in June 2022."
52,"Although inflation has eased significantly since then, it remains higher than the central bank's goal of 2%, raising questions about whether the improvement will be enough to convince the Fed to hold steady for now."
53,Here's what to know about today's Fed meeting and what economists expect.
54,What time is the Fed rate hike decision today?
55,"Members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicked of their meeting today at 9 a.m. Eastern time, with the rate-setting panel set to announce its decision and economic projections at 2 p.m. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. explaining the Fed's monetary policy outlook and to offer his take on the state of the economy."
56,What is the Fed's expected to announce today?
57,"The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady today, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet."
58,"If that occurs, the federal funds rate would remain in a range of 5.25 to 5.5% — the same level as the central bank announced in July, when it last raised rates."
59,That marks the highest level in 22 years.
60,"Even though inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2% target, recent economic data will likely persuade the central bank to take a wait-and-see approach, experts said."
61,"In August, inflation rose by an annual rate of 3.7% amid higher gasoline prices, while core numbers, which excludes volatile fuel and food costs, rose 4.3% from a year ago."
62,"""The consensus view is that the Fed will mark a pause on rate hikes,"" noted Gregory Daco, EY chief economist, in an email before the meeting."
63,"""We look for Fed Chair Powell to stress that restrictive monetary policy has led to a notable cooling of economic activity, labor market momentum and inflation."""
64,Are more interest rate hikes in store?
65,Economists say they expect the Fed to raise rates at its November 1 meeting because inflation is still higher than its 2% goal.
66,"""[W]e believe that a rate hike on November 1 is likely unless the inflation data weakens materially between now and then, which we do not expect,"" said Joseph R. Gaffoglio, president of Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email."
67,How does raising interest rates help lower inflation?
68,"By boosting interest rates, the Fed is turning to its most potent tool in taming high inflation."
69,Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money.
70,"That hits everything from bank loans like mortgages to credit card debt, which in turn dampens consumer spending and investment by businesses."
71,"The impact is perhaps most visible in the real estate market, where the run-up in mortgage rates has cast a pall over homebuying."
72,"The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.18% and 6.51% for a 15-year loan, according to Freddie Mac data, marking the highest borrowing costs in more than two decades."
73,When will borrowing costs fall?
74,"Since March 2022, the Fed has boosted rates 11 times, increasing its benchmark rate to the highest level in 22 years."
75,"At the start of its regime of rate hikes, its benchmark rate was essentially zero, meaning that borrowing was extremely inexpensive."
76,"That led to ultra-low mortgage rates, with some borrowers finding home loans that were below 3%, which helped spur home-buying during the pandemic."
77,"But even with a pause on rate hikes, borrowers shouldn't expect to see better terms any time soon, according to experts."
78,"""The truth is that no one should expect credit card interest rates to stop rising anytime soon,"" noted Matt Schulz, credit industry analyst for LendingTree, in an email before the Fed meeting."
79,"""While we don't know what the Fed will do going forward, cardholders' best move is to assume that rates will continue to rise and do what they can to knock down their credit card debt."""
80,"Mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate increases, but rather tend to track the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note."
81,"Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for Treasurys and Fed policy can also influence rates on home loans."
82,"Still, experts don't expect mortgage rates to dip anytime soon."
83,"""It's always a nearly impossible task to predict mortgage rate movements, but there's no clear reason to expect a sizable drop in the near future,"" Nicole Bachaud, senior economist at Zillow, told CBS MoneyWatch this week."
84,"A looming government shutdown could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising rates in November, Bank of America says."
85,"A looming government shutdown could prevent the Federal Reserve from raising rates in November, but not for the reason you might think, according to Bank of America."
86,"Not only would the shutdown potentially slow down the economy and make a rate hike the wrong move, but a long impasse would mean central bank policymakers have only limited access to inflation data, the investment bank noted."
87,That's because unfunded agencies such as the departments of Labor and Commerce wouldn't be producing key data reports on price trends.
88,"""If the shutdown lasts for a month or more, the Fed would essentially be flying blind at its November meeting, having learned very little about economic activity and price pressures since the September meeting,"" Bank of America U.S. economist Aditya Bhave said in a note."
89,"While Bhave said a long shutdown is not expected, if it lasts longer than a month, ""we think the prudent course of action would be for the Fed to stay on hold in November."
90,Could the Fed hike in December instead?
91,"That is again a close call, but we think a skip in November more likely means the hiking cycle has ended, unless inflation clearly picks up again."""
92,The Fed relies closely on reports from Labor and Commerce to gauge inflation.
93,"In particular, it focuses on Commerce's measure of the personal consumption expenditures price index as a yardstick for where inflation is headed for the longer term."
94,Labor's consumer price index is a widely followed measure by the public and also figures into Fed calculations.
95,"While they aren't the only inflation gauges central bank officials use, not having them around in November would complicate the rate decision."
96,"To be sure, markets think the Fed is done already anyway."
97,"Pricing in the fed funds futures market indicates a less than 30% probability of a final hike in November, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure."
98,The tool indicates the Fed could start cutting by June 2024.
99,"Bank of America, though, expects the Fed to approve one more hike, which would take its key borrowing rate to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%."
100,"Bhave said that if the shutdown only lasts a few weeks, the Fed would have enough time to gather data and likely raise rates again, though he said a hike wouldn't be certain if inflation continues to moderate."
101,"The Fed concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, with markets overwhelmingly expecting rates to stay put."
102,—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.
103,News of a soft landing may be premature.
104,"Federal Reserve officials held interest rates steady at their monthly policy meeting on Sept. 20, 2023 – only the second time they have done so since embarking on a rate-raising campaign a year and a half ago."
105,But it is what they hinted at rather than what they did that caught many economists’ attention: Fed officials indicated that they don’t expect rates to end 2023 higher than they predicted in June – when they last issued their projections.
106,"Since the hiking cycle began, observers have worried about whether increased rates could push the U.S. economy into a downturn."
107,Some have even speculated that a recession had already begun.
108,"However, the economy has been more resilient than many expected, and now many economists are wondering whether the seemingly impossible soft landing – that is, a slowdown that avoids crashing the economy – has become a reality."
109,"As a finance professor, I think it’s premature to start celebrating."
110,"Inflation is still almost double the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, and it is expected to come in at around 4% for September."
111,"What’s more, the economy is still growing quite fast, with consensus forecasts showing gross domestic product will rise by nearly 3% this quarter."
112,Some early data suggests that could be a low estimate.
113,What’s next for interest rates?
114,"Fed watchers are parsing every word from the central bank to determine whether another hike is coming this year or next, or if the cycle is truly over."
115,"To understand that decision, it helps to consider the bigger picture."
116,"While the U.S. economy has certainly avoided a downturn for longer than many expected, the inflation battle is a long way from finished."
117,"In fact, this wouldn’t be the first time the economy looked like it would avoid a soft landing."
118,"For the next several months, the economy is not likely to implode without a major spark."
119,"However, inflation may not continue to fall as quickly in the coming year, which means the Fed may still raise rates more than some expect."
120,"If rising oil prices continue to boost transportation costs, other goods could also get more expensive, which may mean higher interest rates for longer."
121,Is this really the end?
122,"Though Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seemed to indicate that the committee is approaching the end of the hiking cycle, only 10% of economists expect that it is over at this point – not that economists’ track record of forecasting rates is great either."
123,"This is largely because Powell has been clear that the Fed is basing its decisions on economic data, which has been strong so far and hopefully will continue in that direction."
124,"So while everyone is watching the Fed this week, they should also keep an eye on broader economic conditions."
125,"With luck, the reported data will continue to be strong enough to avoid a downturn, but not so strong that inflation picks back up."
126,"Analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to pause interest rate hikes on Wednesday as the central bank looks to tame inflation while avoiding a recession, despite a recent energy-fueled rise in consumer prices."
127,"Analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to pause interest rate hikes on Wednesday as the central bank looks to tame inflation while avoiding a recession, despite a recent energy-fueled rise in consumer prices."
128,"After 11 interest rate hikes since March last year, inflation has fallen sharply but remains stuck stubbornly above the Fed's long-run target of two percent per year -- keeping pressure on officials to consider further policy action."
129,"Despite rising slightly due to increased energy costs, inflation remains well below last year's peak, while economic growth remains robust and the unemployment rate sits close to record lows -- raising hopes the Fed can slow price increases without triggering a downturn."
130,"Fed policymakers launched their second day of deliberations Wednesday morning, ahead of the 2:00 pm (1800 GMT) publication of the interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's decision, along with its updated economic forecasts."
131,"""We look for the FOMC to keep its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged,"" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a recent note to clients, adding that ""most market participants"" expected the Fed to hold rates steady."
132,"The Fed's rate decision will be followed half an hour later by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which will be closely watched for hints on the path of future rate decisions."
133,"""Chair Powell will acknowledge recently softer inflation and lower job openings, but emphasize vigilance given remaining upside risks to inflation,"" economists from Citi wrote in an investor note published Wednesday."
134,"- Sitting tight -
 If the Fed proceeds as expected, it will hold its key lending rate at its current range between 5.25 and 5.50 percent -- a 22-year high."
135,"Traders currently see it as 99 percent likely that the FOMC will hold off on hiking interest rates on Wednesday, and have assigned a roughly 70 percent chance it will vote to do the same at its next meeting in November, according to data from CME Group."
136,"Policymakers are looking to keep the country on what Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee calls the ""golden path,"" attempting to slow down inflation while averting a surge in unemployment and a major economic slowdown."
137,"""If you look at expectations in the marketplace, there's a growing confidence that we can pull it off,"" he said during a recent interview broadcast on NPR."
138,"But Goolsbee added that the Fed must remain ""attentive to the data,"" echoing Powell, who has promised to follow a ""data-dependent"" path going forward."
139,"Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently cut their expectation of a recession in the United States from 20 percent down to 15 percent, while other economists -- including those in the Fed's research team -- say they no longer expect the US economy to contract this year."
140,"- Revision to growth -
 Alongside its interest rate decision, the Fed will also publish updated forecasts for a range of economic indicators, from inflation to growth, as well as with FOMC members' expectations of future interest rate policy."
141,Analysts will be closely analyzing these forecasts for signs of whether policymakers continue signaling they expect interest rates to rise higher than current levels -- as they did in June -- and for how long they think rates should remain high to bring inflation firmly back down to target.
142,They also expect the Fed to significantly raise its economic growth forecast for 2023 from its last update in June due to stronger-than-expected economic output.
143,"""The SEP is likely to undergo meaningful revisions, particularly in 2023,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a recent investor note, adding they expect the growth forecast for this year to double from one percent to two percent."
144,"""The Fed's GDP growth projections are likely to be revised higher and the unemployment rate forecast revised lower in the near term, to reflect the resilience of the economy since the July meeting,"" Oxford Economics' Chief US Economist Michael Pearce wrote in a recent note to clients."

 At any given moment, if you want to know what the Federal Reserve is most likely to do at any of its meetings through the end of 2024, you can head to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group’s FedWatch Tool page."
465,"New York CNN —
 At any given moment, if you want to know what the Federal Reserve is most likely to do at any of its meetings through the end of 2024, you can head to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group’s FedWatch Tool page."
466,"There, you will find a bar chart plotting the share of traders predicting a rate hike, cut or no change in interest rates at an upcoming meeting."
467,"These traders don’t have a secret ear into the Fed’s private meetings nor a crystal ball, and yet their consensus predictions have a tremendous track record."
468,"Perhaps that’s also because Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has made it a point not to surprise markets with monetary policy decisions, most likely keeps tabs on the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, too."
469,"“We don’t go out of our way to surprise markets or the public,” Powell said at the Fed’s June press conference following the decision to pause interest rates for the first time since raising rates at each meeting since March 2022."
470,But how exactly does it all work?
471,"Traders’ actions translate into interest rate decision probabilities
 When the Fed changes interest rates it’s actually changing what’s known as the federal funds rate target range."
472,"The federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other to borrow money, and it impacts the interest rate consumers pay for a variety of loans, including some mortgages."
473,Investors have been trading fed fund futures contracts since the late 1980s.
474,"They would often build their own spreadsheets to try to uncover market sentiment regarding future interest rate decisions, said Agha Mirza, CME Group’s global head of rates and OTC products."
475,"But it wasn’t until 2013 that the CME Group launched the FedWatch tool, giving everyone access to the information without having to do complex calculations."
476,"Trading fed funds futures contracts is no different from any other futures contract, where you’re essentially betting that an asset will hit a certain threshold at a specified time in the future."
477,"In this case, they’re betting on how the Fed will adjust interest rates at its upcoming meetings."
478,"But, unlike other futures contracts, traders use fed fund futures contracts as a tool to hedge their portfolios against market volatility that’s tied to interest rate decisions."
479,"But because they make trades based on what they anticipate will happen with interest rates — or, in some cases, make the trades to broadcast their views — the CME Group is able to aggregate that information and build a clear chart that forecasts interest rate decisions."
480,"Mirza told CNN the tool he helped design “translates the information that is embedded in [the Fed Fund Futures] trillion-dollar market into probabilities that people can make sense of.”
 “FedWatch provides a unique pulse on the market based on trader sentiment, and that is why many professionals use FedWatch regularly,” Mirza said."
481,"Importantly, it captures how investor sentiment changes after crucial data like the Consumer Price Index and the monthly jobs report, in addition to remarks made by Fed officials."
482,"Why the FedWatch Tool is so closely followed
 The Fed’s interest rate decisions can have serious implications for your investments."
483,"“Investors pay close attention to this gauge for portfolio positioning purposes to parse out how the market might react based on Fed action,” said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth."
484,"In general, the Fed tries to avoid making decisions that go against market expectations."
485,"When the Fed does so, it can cause markets to be more volatile, according to research authored by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke and Ken Kuttner, an economics professor at Williams College."
486,"For instance, Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last year cast a more hawkish tone than markets were expecting when he warned that interest rate hikes would mean “pain” for US households."
487,"That sent the Dow down by 1,000 points."
488,"Going against expectations can be “counterproductive and have negative consequences for the economy,” said Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, and could result in market movements that would effectively “offset the impact of monetary policy by instantaneously affecting business investment, consumer spending or residential investment.”
 That’s why Fed officials regularly make public remarks to signal how they plan to vote at upcoming meetings and provide forward guidance on future decisions so that investors have more time to prepare, Daco added."
489,"McGrath said Fed officials likely monitor the FedWatch Tool “to gauge how they need to address the markets.”
 “Generally speaking, they don’t want to upset the apple cart in their long-stated goal of keeping employment steady and inflation at a minimum — and keeping markets from being extremely volatile is a key cog in that wheel,” McGrath told CNN."

503,"The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will pause its rate hikes, keeping its benchmark lending rate at a 22-year high, while signaling fewer rate cuts next year."
504,"Washington, DC CNN —
 The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will pause its rate hikes, keeping its benchmark lending rate at a 22-year high, while signaling fewer rate cuts next year."
505,"The move was widely expected, after the central bank signaled in recent weeks that it intended to wait for more data to understand how previous rate hikes are affecting the US economy."
506,"Since March 2022, the Fed has lifted interest rates 11 times and held them steady twice, including September’s pause."
507,"The Fed’s latest set of economic projections showed that more officials expect the Fed’s key lending rate to top out at a range of 5.63-5.87% this year, meaning there could likely be another rate hike by year’s end."
508,Officials revised their expectation of economic growth this year much higher and their projection of the unemployment rate slightly lower.
509,"Notably, officials expect fewer rate cuts in 2024 than previously estimated, confirming investors’ fears that interest rates could remain higher for longer."
510,"“The new projections suggest that the Fed has a fairly strong degree of confidence in its outlook for a soft landing and, in turn, that there will be very minimal space for policy easing next year,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note."
511,"“The dot plot for next year has certainly rammed home the message of ‘higher for longer’ and reflects the continued wariness and fear of an inflation resurgence if it takes the foot off the brake too soon and too quickly,” she said."
512,"The central bank’s latest post-meeting statement Wednesday said “economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace,” compared with a “moderate pace” noted in the previous statement."
513,"The statement also noted that job gains have “slowed in recent months,” compared with job growth being described as “robust” in the Fed’s July policy statement."
514,"Fed officials again emphasized that the central bank is “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.” Officials deliberate monetary policy again at their two-day meeting next month, which concludes on November 1."
515,"US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, with the Dow 0.2% lower, the S&P 500 losing 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.5%."
516,"‘A soft landing is a primary objective’
 Inflation has slowed steadily from its four-decade peak last June, and it could ease all the way to the Fed’s 2% target without a sharp uptick in unemployment — a scenario known as a “soft landing.” Or, inflation could eventually drift down to 2%, but with the economy slipping into a recession as unemployment rises."
517,"Some Fed officials are optimistic they can pull off a soft landing, but the central bank has to contend with a number of uncertainties and economic headwinds in the coming months, including the resumption of student loan payments next month, rising energy costs threatening core inflation’s slowdown, consumer fatigue from high inflation and the delayed effects of previous rate hikes on the broader, real economy."
518,"In his post-meeting news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a soft landing “was a plausible outcome” and that a soft landing could be jeopardized by “factors that are outside of our control.”
 After a reporter’s question suggested that a soft landing isn’t a goal of the Fed’s, Powell said the central bank has always been aiming to achieve the elusive soft landing."
519,"“To begin, a soft landing is a primary objective and I did not say otherwise."
520,"That’s what we’ve been trying to achieve for all this time,” he said."
521,"“The real point, though, is the worst thing we could do was to fail to restore price stability because the record is clear on that."
522,"If you don’t restore price stability, inflation comes back.”
 Markets stumbled after Powell’s remarks on the soft landing possibility."
523,"Powell’s assessment of growth and rising energy prices
 So far, the economy has been remarkably resilient in the face of the Fed’s most aggressive inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s."
524,"Robust spending on travel, concerts and films fueled the economy during the summer, but it remains to be seen whether that momentum will continue."
525,That led Fed officials to revise up their projections of economic growth this year and next year.
526,"The median projection for GDP growth this year came in at 2.1%, versus the 1% rate projected in June, and officials revised up their projections of growth in 2024 as well."
527,Powell has said the central bank needs to see “below-trend growth” and for the job market to come into better balance in terms of demand and supply.
528,But he said at Wednesday’s news conference that the Fed isn’t looking at GDP in isolation.
529,"“GDP is not a mandate — maximum employment and price stability are the mandates,” Powell said."
530,"He said that officials determine whether the strength of GDP is “a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation.”
 Economists widely expect slower growth this year, rather than an economic slump."
531,Another risk that emerged recently is volatility in energy markets.
532,A combination of production cuts from oil-exporting nations and supply disruptions due to a deadly flooding in Libya helped push up gas prices in recent weeks.
533,"The national average for regular gasoline stood at $3.88 a gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA, the highest since October 2022."
534,"The Consumer Price Index rose 3.7% in August from a year earlier, up from July’s 3.2% rise, with gas prices being the largest contributor to that acceleration."
535,"Rising energy prices, if elevated for long enough, could eventually feed into core inflation by making services such as freight and air transportation more expensive."
536,Powell said as much during his presser.
537,"“Energy prices being higher, that is a significant thing,” Powell said."
538,"“Energy prices being up can affect spending over time, a sustained period of higher energy prices can affect consumers’ expectations about inflation."
539,"We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at core inflation, so the question is, how long will those higher prices sustain?”
 Some economists expect demand to slow the rest of the year, helping ease some upward pressure on gas prices."
540,"On Wednesday, Sensex and Nifty opened lower amid caution among investors before the US Federal Reserve’s meeting outcome."

 Confident the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged, investors are far more focused on the release of new forecasts on Wednesday that will reveal how much U.S. central bank policy-makers buy into the prospect of an economic “soft landing” and what rate environment will prevail alongside it."
561,"In the near term, Fed officials are expected to still project one more rate hike before the end of 2023, likely to be delivered at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting."
562,"But beyond that, the release of the updated Summary of Economic Projections will force Fed policy-makers to show if they believe a recent run of good data can continue – with inflation slowing alongside stronger-than-anticipated job and economic growth – or whether even more restrictive monetary policy will be needed to finish the fight against rising prices despite the risks that brings of a hard stop to the post-pandemic economic expansion."
563,"Policy-makers’ projections are “likely to undergo meaningful revisions … including upgrades to growth and the labour market and a downward revision to inflation, at least in 2023,” wrote Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects the main body of Fed officials to still project one more rate hike this year."
564,"Should it occur, that next rate increase may indeed be the last of a tightening cycle that began in March 2022, but projections for next year and beyond will indicate how long the period of high interest rates is expected to be, how fast inflation returns to target, and how much the economy slows and unemployment rises along the way."
565,The new projections and the Fed’s latest policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
566,Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later.
567,"As of the last set of quarterly projections, published in June, the median Fed policy maker end-year projection was for economic growth of 1.0 per cent, underlying inflation of 3.9 per cent, and the benchmark overnight interest rate to be in the 5.50 per cent-5.75 per cent range, just a quarter of a percentage point above the range approved at the last meeting in July."
568,"The June projections showed that economic growth was expected to remain around 1 per cent next year, with underlying inflation falling to 2.6 per cent by the end of 2024 and to 2.2 per cent by the end of 2025 – within striking distance of the Fed’s 2 per cent target."
569,"With inflation slowing, that would allow interest rates to decline also."
570,"The last set of projections envisioned that the Fed’s policy rate would fall by a percentage point in 2024, and by 1.2 percentage points in 2025 to end that year in the 3.25 per cent-3.50 per cent range."
571,"How much those values shift, particularly around the rate cuts envisioned next year, and what the first glimpse of 2026 says about the longer-run outlook, will amount to a tacit vote on whether the Fed’s faith in the soft landing, a scenario in which inflation falls without major job losses or a recession, has grown stronger because of the economy’s resilience, or weaker because of concern that price pressures might persist and force an even tighter policy stance."
572,"Data since the Fed’s July meeting could support either argument, with recent releases often sending mixed messages."
573,"A home builder survey released on Monday, for example, revealed a souring in sentiment in September."
574,"A Commerce Department report on Tuesday showed housing starts fell 11.3 per cent in August, while new permits, a leading indicator for future investment, jumped a healthy 6.9 per cent."
575,"Recent data on prices showed inflation picking up speed, but for reasons, such as high energy costs, that will likely fade, and the pace of trend inflation still moderating."
576,"But Powell and other Fed officials have said that for them to feel confident in a broad “disinflation,” the economy will have to operate below its potential for a period of time."
577,"It hasn’t happened so far, with economic growth through the first half of the year above the 1.8 per cent rate that Fed officials view as the economy’s noninflationary trend, and continuing that way through the third quarter."
578,"That likely means a markup for the economy in the coming projections, and possibly a drift toward tighter monetary policy as well, said Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of the fund giant’s investment strategy group."
579,"Given how the economy is behaving, the Fed “may need to raise rates further (or) need to hold policy tighter for longer” in order to slow the economy, Davis said, adding that a “soft landing is still possible, but not probable.”

 Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty on Wednesday fell about 796 points or over 1 per cent to 66,800.84, due to heavy selling in banking and oil stocks in tandem with weak global trends ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision."

647,Investors are awaiting the Fed’s interest rate decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday to assess the outlook for economic growth and fuel demand.
648,"The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold, but the focus will be on its projected policy path, which is unclear."
649,"“The oil rally is taking a little break as every trader awaits a pivotal Fed decision that might tilt the scales of whether the U.S. economy has a soft or hard landing,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA."

654,Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a 2.2 million-barrel decline.
655,"“Barring any unpleasant surprise, attention will likely return to the perceived supply deficit once interest rate decisions are out of the way and reaching the $100/bbl milestone remains a not-so-distant possibility,” said Tamas Varga, analyst at oil broker PVM."
656,“We have nudged up our 12-month ahead Brent forecast from $93 a barrel to $100 a barrel as we now expect modestly sharper inventory draws.

 The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady this week as the central bank faces a slew of economic and political risks while attempting to quash inflation."
662,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel of Fed officials responsible for setting interest rates, will wrap up a two-day meeting Wednesday and likely keep borrowing costs unchanged."
663,Experts expect the Fed to tread carefully as the economy perches on a ledge of shifting indicators and divergent projections.
664,"While inflation has accelerated for two consecutive months, a steadier slowdown in hiring, job openings and economic growth could be the signs of the Fed’s rate hikes taking hold."
665,"“The effects of the interest rate hikes have not been seen widely because typically it takes about five quarters to see the real impact,” Mohammad Bhuiyan, a professor of entrepreneurship at Tuskegee University in Alabama, told The Hill."
666,Bhuiyan said it takes roughly 15 months for rate hikes to hit the economy.
667,"“That’s the lag time,” he said."
668,A pause would allow the Fed to step back and see if the economy continues to slow before its next meeting in November.
669,Some Democrats and progressive policymakers insist the Fed has already done enough to curb inflation and risks throwing the economy into an avoidable recession.
670,"But the Fed is also facing growing criticism from Republicans, including a cadre of presidential candidates who are pledging to make major changes at the central bank if elected."
671,"Political consequences of the Fed’s inflation fight
 Whether the Fed succeeds in curbing inflation without causing a recession could have serious implications for the 2024 presidential election."
672,President Biden has already been campaigning on his economic track record during the pandemic and the rapid recovery seen during his presidency.
673,"“When I came to office and this nation was flat on its back, I knew what to do to vaccinate the nation, to rebuild the economy,” he said at a campaign event at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on Broadway on Monday night."
674,"While Biden presided over record-shattering job gains and a historically strong labor market, many Americans are sour on his economic record due largely to inflation."
675,"More than half of respondents to a CNN poll from earlier this month said Biden’s economic policies had made the economy worse, and another poll found greater trust in former President Trump’s handling of the economy."
676,"Political consequences of the Fed’s inflation fight are also materializing for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, with Republicans grumbling that central bankers got started raising interest rates too late."
677,Powell is a registered Republican who has won broad bipartisan support both times the Senate votes on his confirmation as Fed chief but is unlikely to be reappointed if Biden loses.
678,“I would not reappoint him.
679,"I thought he was always late, whether it was good or bad, but he was always late,” said Trump, who nominated Powell to be Fed chairman and then feuded with him throughout his tenure, in an interview with the Fox Business Network in August."
680,Former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Gov.
681,Ron DeSantis (R) have also vowed not to renominate Powell.
682,"“From COVID on, they put too much money into the economy,” DeSantis told CNBC last month."
683,“They were behind the ball on that.
684,"And then they’ve hiked so much now, it’s caused a lot of problems in the economy and could end up driving us into a recession,” he said."
685,"A strong but straining labor market
 The U.S. labor market, which was given steroids in the form of trillions of fiscal and monetary stimulus during the pandemic, has remained remarkably strong in the face of the Fed’s rate hikes."
686,But signs of cooling are now evident.
687,"The quits rate, a sign of worker confidence in the labor market, has fallen from a recent high in April of last year of 3 percent down to 2.3 percent in July."
688,"The economy has been adding fewer jobs on a monthly basis since the beginning of the year, with some ups and downs."
689,"After adding 472,000 jobs in January, that number fell to 105,000 in June, bucking up to 157,000 in July and 187,000 in August."
690,The unemployment rate ticked up in August to 3.8 percent after hovering near historic lows since roughly March of last year.
691,"“When you raise interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow, so that cuts into their profitability and they cut their borrowing,” Bhuyian said."
692,"“When that happens, they have less money to work with, which means they need to cut workers — that’s the first place they go,” he continued."
693,Higher unemployment does not affect all segments of the population equally.
694,"The unemployment rate for Black workers, which hit an all-time low of 4.7 percent earlier this year, is still consistently higher and more volatile than it is for white workers."
695,“I am concerned that we could lose what has become an indicator that the Black community has been really pleased about overall.
696,"There was a time in our history when the Black unemployment rate did not go below double digits,” Michelle Holder, an associate professor of economics at John Jay College in New York City, told The Hill."
697,"“I absolutely remember what it was like … at that time, where it was just accepted that our community would be dealing with high unemployment — period,” she said."
698,"Conflict in an overwhelmed housing market
 Another pressure point for the Fed is the housing market, where much of the inflation that remains in the economy is located."
699,“Housing makes up the most significant and most enduring component of our measures of inflation.
700,"Unlike the price of gas or the price of toilet paper, housing costs are the biggest expense for most poor and working-class people,” Tara Raghuveer, housing activist and founding director of KC Tenants, a tenants’ rights organization in Kansas City, told The Hill."
701,"“The cost of housing and specifically the rate of rent increase — the fact that the rent is too damn high — is an incredible stress point for the American people,” she said."
702,"Strategists say rising oil prices, an uncertain path forward for the Federal Reserve and a looming government shutdown could drive stock market choppiness."
703,Investors' favorite measure of volatility has been quiet over the past month.
704,"The CBOE Volatility Index, known by its ticker as simply the VIX (^VIX), has fallen for most of 2023 outside of a spike during the banking crisis in March, indicating expectations for volatility in the S&P 500 have been muted this year."
705,Some on Wall Street believe that's about to change.
706,"""We haven't seen volatility this low since pre-pandemic period,"" Charles Schwab Chief Global Investment Strategist Jeffrey Kleintop told Yahoo Finance Live."
707,"""So the market's certainly pricing in clear sailing from here, and it may not be that smooth of a ride."""
708,"As the above graphic indicates, seasonality is at play for the VIX, which often rises into October earnings season."
709,But market strategists argue it could be more than that as headwinds mount.
710,"The Federal Reserve is set to keep interest rates steady at its meeting this week, but investors fear the central bank is leaning toward a hawkish bias that will see interest rates remain higher than initially expected for a longer period of time."
711,JPMorgan believes the prospect alone could be enough to shake markets.
712,"""Equity valuation faces increasing risk from higher for longer,"" JPMorgan head of investment strategy Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note on Monday."
713,"""Equities are up 16% YTD mostly on multiple expansion while real rates and cost of capital are moving deeper into restrictive territory."
714,"History suggests this relationship is becoming increasingly unsustainable, posing risk to the equity multiple."""
715,The high interest rates could further squeeze consumers who are already facing the reemergence of student loans.
716,The ongoing strike from the United Auto Workers and a potential government shutdown could also have broader downside implications for spending and therefore business growth.
717,"Not to mention oil prices are at their highest levels since November 2022, with some strategists predicting that oil will rise above $100 per barrel."
718,"Story continues
 ""As Summer 2023 transitions to Fall, Confusion Reigns Supreme,"" Evercore ISI senior managing director Julian Emanuel wrote in a note on September 10."
719,"""Markets don’t know whether good news is bad and bad news is good for stocks, or for that matter, what exactly defines Good or Bad News."""
720,Emanuel said high oil prices have garnered mixed results in the past.
721,"In 2010-2014, they were accompanied by rising consumer confidence and stocks."
722,"Still, Emanuel pointed out that rising oil often doesn't mean higher stocks."
723,He highlighted other events that sent oil higher — such as the developing conflict between Ukraine and Russia during 2022 or the Great Financial Crisis — but still contributed to bear markets.
724,"""Discounting of a Recession in the form of a period of higher volatility and a deeper market pullback is not likely at least until 2024,"" Emanuel wrote."
725,"""Yet the Consumer’s psyche, already challenged by high gasoline prices, a low savings rate and the need to start repaying student loan debt, could give way."""
726,A government shutdown could also be added to Emanuel's list of looming market headwinds.
727,The shutdown is expected to commence on on October 1 and could be one of the most expensive yet.
728,"Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner notes these events often ""inject volatility."""
729,"Even if a shutdown often doesn't have a ""major market impact,"" it'll likely be one of several things working against equities in the weeks ahead."
730,"""We continue to anticipate that equities will remain in choppy waters near term as we remain in a seasonally weak period, stocks continue to consolidate large year-to-date gains, and we are lacking an obvious near-term catalyst,"" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday."
731,"SANTA BARBARA, CA-FEBRUARY 24, 2023: Members of the Harbor Patrol head out into choppy waters, as seen from Stearns Wharf, the result of a powerful storm making its way through Southern California."

773,"High gas prices are a headache for elected officials and consumers, particularly less affluent Americans, and they present a challenge for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who have sought to rein in rapid inflation over the past 18 months."

775,But investors will watch for any hint that rate increases might be over.
776,"Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave interest rates unchanged at their meeting on Wednesday, buying themselves more time to assess whether borrowing costs are high enough to weigh down the economy and wrestle inflation under control."
777,But investors are likely to focus less on what policymakers do on Wednesday and more on what they say about the future.

788,The Fed is due to announce its latest interest rate decision on Wednesday and is widely expected to keep rates unchanged.
789,"However, investors are expecting to get fresh insights into the Fed's policy plans and expectations for the economy as it will also release its quarterly outlook for various key economic indicators."
790,"That includes interest rates as well as the gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment."
791,Many investors have been hoping that the end of the Fed's rate-hiking cycle is near as concerns about higher rates dragging the U.S. economy into a recession have persisted.
792,"Fed officials have not, however, discounted the possibility of more rate hikes."

798,The Federal Reserve is set to leave its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday as it seeks to guide the U.S. economy toward a “soft landing” of cooling inflation without triggering a deep recession.
799,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is set to leave its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday as it seeks to guide the U.S. economy toward a “soft landing” of cooling inflation without triggering a deep recession.
800,Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re now inclined to move more gradually and cautiously toward their goal of 2% annual inflation.
801,"Their more deliberative approach follows the 11 rate hikes they unleashed beginning in March 2022, which substantially raised borrowing costs for consumers and businesses."
802,"Yet with inflation pressures still underlying the economy, Powell won’t be declaring victory on Wednesday, when the Fed’s latest policy meeting ends."
803,The attention of investors and economists will instead focus on what signals the Fed may send about its likely next actions.
804,The clearest signal will likely come from the Fed’s 19-member interest-rate committee in the batch of economic forecasts its members issue each quarter.
805,The updated projections are likely to show that the policymakers expect to raise their benchmark rate once more this year.
806,"That rate now stands at roughly 5.4%, its highest point in 22 years."
807,"And those projections will likely also show that the Fed envisions fewer interest rate cuts next year than it did in June, when it projected three rate reductions in 2024."
808,"Even as the central bank is winding down its rate hikes, Powell and other Fed officials have said their key rate could remain at its peak well into next year."
809,Analysts expect the Fed’s forecasts Wednesday to show just one or two rate cuts in 2024.
810,Further clues about the future path of the Fed’s interest rate policy could emerge at a news conference Powell will hold after the central bank issues a policy statement and its quarterly economic projections.
811,"In raising its short-term interest rate at the fastest pace in four decades, the Fed has sought to moderate borrowing and spending, slow the economy and tame inflation."
812,"So far, consumer inflation, measured year over year, has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in June of last year to 3.7% in August."
813,Yet it’s still well above the Fed’s target.
814,"Powell and other central bank officials have said that while they are making progress, they aren’t yet done."
815,"Even as overall inflation has declined, the cost of many services — from auto insurance and car repairs to veterinary services and hair salons — are still climbing faster than they were before the pandemic."
816,"Still, most recent data is pointing in the direction the Fed wants to see: Inflation in June and July, excluding volatile food and energy prices, posted its two lowest monthly readings in nearly two years."
817,"And signs have grown that the job market isn’t as robust as it had been, which helps keep a check on inflation: The pace of hiring has moderated."
818,The number of unfilled openings fell sharply in June and July.
819,And the number of Americans who have started seeking work has jumped.
820,"This has brought labor demand and supply into better balance and eased the pressure on employers to raise pay to attract and keep workers, which can lead them to raise prices to offset higher labor costs."
821,"Yet the path back to lower inflation has already become more uneven: On a monthly basis, consumer prices jumped 0.6% in August, the most in more than a year."
822,"Compared with a year earlier, prices rose 3.7%, the second straight such increase."
823,"Some emerging factors, meantime, are threatening to re-ignite inflation, weaken the economy, or both."
824,"Rising oil prices, for example, are making gasoline steadily more expensive."
825,"Should that trend continue, it would worsen inflation and leave consumers with less money to spend."
826,"Next month, millions of Americans will have to resume their student loan payments when a pandemic-era pause ends."
827,Even the so-far limited strike by the United Auto Workers union against the Big 3 U.S. automakers could slow growth and further inflate vehicle prices.
828,This week’s Fed meeting comes as central banks around the world are mostly raising rates to fight inflation.
829,"Prices spiked after the pandemic hampered global supply chains, causing shortages and higher prices."
830,Inflation worsened after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent oil and other commodity prices spiking.
831,"The European Central Bank raised its benchmark rate last week for the 10th time to 4%, the highest level on record since the euro was established in 1999, though it signaled that it could be its last hike."
832,The Bank of England is also expected to increase its rate when it meets Thursday.
833,"The Bank of Japan, which meets Friday, is under less pressure to boost rates, although it has taken steps to allow Japanese long-term rates to tick up."
