1,Scotiabank’s Derek Holt: “There are very widespread expectations for an expedited taper and a move toward ending purchases probably by about March.
2,“The bigger uncertainty may be around how the dots shift and whether Powell continues to distance himself from them.
3,I think the median dot will bring forward 50bps of hikes into 2022 which shouldn’t spook fed funds futures pricing that’s already there with about 2½ 25bps hikes priced by the end of 2022.
4,“Fewer hikes and/or Powell’s distancing himself from the dots again could come across dovishly.
5,"More of a shift in the dots toward 3-4 hikes could be more hawkish and toward our 100bps forecast for hikes in 2022.”

 Central bank likely to double rate at which it cuts spending on government bonds, in shift that could herald interest rate rises
 The US Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate an end to the central bank’s pandemic-era support of the US economy on Wednesday night, in a major shift that could herald a series of interest rate rises next year."
42,"The expected measures are a signal that US central bankers no longer view rising inflation as a “transitory” nuisance caused by supply chain problems meeting pent-up consumer demand, but an issue that now requires firm management to avert lasting damage to the US economy."
43,"At the end of a two-day meeting in Washington, the Fed is anticipated to announce it will reduce its monthly $120bn (£90bn) spending on government bonds designed to lower long-term interest rates at twice the rate that chairman, Jerome Powell, outlined just six weeks ago."
44,Officials are also expected to forecast that they will raise short-term rates that have been set at near-zero for close to two years.
45,"A forecast for a series of rate rises next year is, again, a departure from indications offered by central bankers just three months ago when the Fed forecast one rate increase in 2022."
46,"Central bankers in many of the world’s major economies are attempting a delicate tightrope walk: raise rates enough to tamp down inflation, but not so much as as to crush businesses, already struggling to meet rising wages and materials costs, with higher borrowing costs, including for mortgages, credit cards and loans."
47,"Efforts to curb inflation, which reached 6.8% in November, the highest in 39 years, come amid signs that consumers are beginning to tap into savings to meet the cost of living."
48,"Producer prices increased more than expected in the year to November, registering their largest gains in a decade, while retail sales gains slowed last month to 0.3% from an increase of 1.8% in October."
49,"“With prices rising sharply last month, the muted 0.3% m/m rise in retail sales values suggests that consumption was little changed in real terms,” noted Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics."
50,"“That won’t stop the Fed from accelerating the pace of its QE taper later today, but it supports our view that economic growth is likely to slow next year.”
 Economists believe that many consumers, liberated from Delta-variant lockdowns, have been spending enthusiastically before the Christmas season to avoid shortages."
51,"But despite the slowdown in spending gains, consumer demand is well above last year’s levels, with retail sales – the largest driver of the US economic activity – rising 18.2% in November from a year earlier."
52,"“It’s very possible that people are taking a bit of an advantage or changing lanes because they are afraid of bad news coming from the Fed,” Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told Reuters."
53,"“But on the other hand, if the market were really afraid of bad news, the futures should have moved a lot more."
54,"So, this is not really a market that is speaking its voice, not yet.”
 With higher interest rates forecast – economists polled by Reuters predict rate rises of 0.25-0.50% in the third quarter of 2022, followed by another in the fourth – economists say that consumers may be spending before belt-tightening as pandemic support cheques end and the cost of credit increases."
55,"At the same time, record wage increases of 4.2% to September over a year earlier have not kept pace with official inflation figures."
56,"In reality, the rising costs of fuel, housing, transport and food have pushed the costs of living higher and faster than official numbers reveal."
57,"Before Powell’s highly anticipated press conference at 1900 GMT, US energy prices fell further on fears of weakening demand due to fallout from the Omicron coronavirus variant and the reintroduction of containment measures."
58,"“With disposable incomes now falling in real terms, as fiscal support fades and surging prices take their toll, and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant likely to exert at least some drag on high-contact services activity, real consumption growth looks set for much slower growth over the months ahead,” predicted Hunter."

 America's inflation spikes have prompted the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace in normalizing its pandemic-era monetary policy."
68,(CNN) — America's inflation spikes have prompted the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace in normalizing its pandemic-era monetary policy.
69,"On Wednesday, the central bank said it will wrap up its stimulus program faster than originally announced, and its updated economic projections show multiple interest rate increases in 2022."
70,"The central bank, which first announced in November that it was ""tapering"" its monthly asset purchases, said Wednesday that it will do so at a quicker pace."
71,"Starting in January, the Fed will cut its monthly purchases of Treasury securities by $20 billion and cut its monthly mortage-backed securities buys by $10 billion."
72,That leaves the purchases at $40 billion for Treasury securities and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities each month.
73,That's consistent with what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress in late November.
74,"At this pace, the Fed is another two meetings away from completing the wind down of the stimulus, Powell told reporters during Wednesday's press conference."
75,The Fed's next two meetings will be in January and March.
76,"But the central bank also reserves the right to change the pace of monthly purchases again if the economic outlook demands it, Wednesday's statement said."
77,"Rate hikes are coming

78,"Fed officials now predict the central bank's benchmark interest rate to rise to 0.9% in 2022, up from the 0.3% expectation from September, signaling additional interest hikes."
79,"To investors and market watchers, this suggests there will be three rate hikes next year."
80,"So far, market expectations for an interest rate increase are really picking up in May, according to the CME FedWatch tool."
81,"Any rate increases will likely be gradual, Powell told reporters during Wednesday's press conference."
82,"And at this point, potential economic fallout from the spread of the Omicron variant hasn't yet changed the Fed's view."
83,"Once rates are raised, the next challenge for the Fed will be reducing its enormous balance sheet."
84,"""We had our first discussion about the balance sheet,"" at this month's meeting, Powell said, even if any action in that regard is still far off."
85,"But inflation might stick around, too
 US inflation has still not come down from its highs."
86,Last week's consumer price inflation report showed prices have risen to a 39-year high over the 12-month period ended in November.
87,"(CPI isn't the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, though; the price index tracking personal consumption expenditure is.)"
88,Powell acknowledged that there's a real risk that the pandemic-era inflation will stick around for longer than initially expected.
89,"""One of the reason the behind our move today is to put us in a position,"" to deal with inflation, Powell said."
90,He added that the Fed wasn't behind the curve in responding to the price spikes: It adjusted its policy immediately when it became clear that higher prices were going to stick around.
91,"""In September -- I'd say after Labor Day -- it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent,"" Powell said."
92,"The Fed got the Employment Cost Index on the Friday before the November meeting, which was ""a very high reading,"" he added, and the employment report two days after the meeting was very strong and showed no increase in labor, he said."

153,"The Federal Reserve provided multiple indications Wednesday that its run of ultra-easy policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is coming to a close, making aggressive policy moves in response to rising inflation."
154,"For one, the central bank said it will accelerate the reduction of its monthly bond purchases."
155,"The Fed will be buying $60 billion of bonds each month starting in January, half the level prior to the November taper and $30 billion less than it had been buying in December."
156,"The Fed was tapering by $15 billion a month in November, doubled that in December, then will accelerate the reduction further come 2022."
157,"After that wraps up, in late winter or early spring, the central bank expects to start raising interest rates, which were held steady at this week's meeting."
158,"Projections released Wednesday indicate that Fed officials see as many as three rate hikes coming in 2022, with two in the following year and two more in 2024."
159,"""Economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy,"" Chairman Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference."
160,"The Federal Open Market Committee's moves, approved unanimously, represent a substantial adjustment to policy that has been the loosest in its 108-year history."
161,The post-meeting statement noted the impact from inflation.
162,"""Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,"" the statement said."
163,"The committee sharply ratcheted up its inflation outlook for 2021, pushing it to 5.3% from 4.2% for all items and to 4.4% from 3.7% excluding food and energy."
164,"For 2022, the expectation is now 2.6% for headline and 2.7% for core, both up from September."
165,"At the same time, the unemployment rate projection for 2021 came down to 4.3% from 4.8% in September."
166,"The statement noted that ""job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment
 rate has declined substantially."""
167,"However, members came out on the hawkish side of policy moves, with members solidly leaning toward rate hikes."
168,"The ""dot plot"" of individual members rate expectations indicated that just six of the 18 FOMC members saw fewer than three increases next year, and no members saw rates staying where they are now, anchored near zero."
169,"That vote came even as the statement reaffirmed that the Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate would stay near zero ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment."""
170,"The committee reduced its forecast for economic growth this year, seeing GDP rising 5.5% for 2021, compared with the 5.9% indicated in September."
171,"Officials also revised their forecasts in subsequent year, raising 2022 growth to 4% from 3.8% and lowering 2023 to 2.2% from 2.5%."
172,"The statement again noted that developments with the Covid pandemic, in particular with variants, pose risks to the outlook."
173,"Inflation hotter than expected
 Both policy moves came in response to escalating inflation, which is running at its highest level in 39 years for consumer prices."
174,"Wholesale prices in November jumped 9.6%, the fastest on record in a sign that inflation pressures are becoming more ingrained and broad based."
175,"Fed officials long have stressed that inflation is ""transitory,"" which Powell has defined as unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy."
176,"He and other central bank leaders, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have stressed that prices are booming due to pandemic-related factors such as extraordinary demand that has outstripped supply but ultimately will fade."
177,"However, the term had become a pejorative and the post-meeting statement eliminated it."
178,"Powell telegraphed the move during congressional testimony last month, saying ""it's probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean."""
179,"For the Powell Fed, tightening policy now marks a dramatic pivot off a policy enacted just over a year ago."
180,"Known as ""flexible average inflation targeting,"" which meant it would be content with inflation a little above or below its long-held 2% target."
181,The policy's practical application was that the Fed was willing to let inflation run a little hot in the interest of completely healing the labor market from the hit it took during the pandemic.
182,"The Fed's new policy sought employment that was both full and inclusive across racial, gender and economic lines."
183,"Officials agreed not to raise interest rates in anticipation of increasing inflation, as the central bank had done in the past."
184,"However, as the ""transitory"" narrative came into question and inflation began to look stronger and more durable, the Fed has had to rethink its intentions and shift gears."

186,"That still left the month buys at $70 billion and $35 billion, respectively."
187,"However, the Fed's $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 billion and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion."
188,"Over the past 12 months, Treasury holdings have expanded by $978 billion while MBS has risen by $567 billion."
189,"Under the new terms of a program also known as quantitative easing, the Fed would accelerate the decline of its holdings until it is no longer adding to its portfolio."
190,That would bring QE to an end in the spring and allow the central bank to raise rates anytime after.
191,"The Fed has said it likely would not hike rates and continue buying bonds simultaneously, as the two moves would work at cross purposes."
192,"From there, the Fed at anytime could start reducing its balance sheet either by selling securities outright, or, in the more likely scenario, begin allowing the proceeds of its current bond holdings to run off each month at a controlled pace."

 Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Amid rising inflation, some analysts expect the Federal Reserve to end their policy meeting Wednesday by clearing the way for its first interest rate hike in more than three years."
198,The Fed appears poised to announce that it's accelerating the end of its emergency bond-buying program by a few months.
199,Economists say the move would be a precursor to a rate hike sometime in 2022.

 Despite a slight rebound, the euro exchange rate remains clearly above the level of PLN 4.60."
220,This means that the Polish zloty remains very weak.
221,The market’s attention will focus today on the evening statement from the Federal Reserve.
222,"On Wednesday at 10:26 the euro was traded at PLN 4.6231, which is similar to yesterday evening."
223,"The day before, the EUR / PLN exchange rate returned from the highest level in two weeks after it rose quite quickly from PLN 4.58 to PLN 4.6454 in the previous days."
224,"– The zloty quite efficiently reached the level of 4.64 per EUR, which, in our opinion, exhausted the potential for weakening resulting from, inter alia, the delayed approval of the National Reconstruction Plan by the European Commission – assessed Bank Millennium analysts."

240,"London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve, faced with the highest jump in inflation in almost four decades , is preparing to pivot."
241,"What's happening: Gone are the days when Chair Jerome Powell said inflation was ""transitory."""
242,"When the Fed wraps up its final meeting of the year on Wednesday, it's expected to announce that it will wind down its emergency bond-buying program faster than expected as it tries to curb rising prices."
243,The central bank will also send a message to investors about how soon it expects to start raising interest rates from rock-bottom levels.
244,But some economists and executives are alarmed by what they're seeing.
245,"They worry that without decisive action soon, the Fed will miss its opportunity to keep a lid on inflation, which is notoriously tricky to manage once it starts accelerating."
246,"""Two things happen when inflation gets embedded,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" earlier this week."
247,"""One, you lose purchasing power, and the poor suffer the most."
248,"Second, you get a Fed overreaction, and then you get a recession, and then you get income losses."
249,"So, you really want to navigate this process in a timely and orderly way."""
250,"He thinks the Fed shouldn't wait until it stops buying bonds to think about interest rate hikes, as it has previously indicated it would do."
251,"That conversation needs to start ""now."""
252,"Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, also believes the Fed should ""probably be more worried about these higher prices."""
253,"""The Fed must act now to help prevent faster inflation from scuttling the US economic expansion and eroding consumers' purchasing power,"" Peterson wrote in a column for CNN Business on Monday ."
254,"""That means it should accelerate the pace of its quantitative easing taper, and raise interest rates a few times next year."""
255,Remember: The Fed hasn't wanted to pull back support for the economy at a pace that could derail the jobs recovery.
256,"Yet Peterson writes that ""incoming labor market data suggest that the economy has achieved or will soon reach full employment, but inflation is still out of control."""
257,"In June, the Fed predicted that its preferred measure of inflation would run at 3.4% in 2021, already well above its target of roughly 2%."
258,The latest data from October showed inflation at 5%.
259,November could be even worse.
260,"Even if the Fed does start to move more aggressively, there are questions about how effective interest rate hikes would be in the current environment."
261,"Boosting rates could help cool the red-hot housing market, but won't do much to directly address supply chain problems and labor shortages, which are major reasons prices have climbed over the past year."
262,That bolsters the case for caution at the central bank.
263,"""Three main factors have driven inflation over the past year: fiscal stimulus, tight labor markets, and supply-chain problems,"" Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork, recently wrote in The Atlantic ."
264,"""All three of these will dissipate over the next year or two."
265,"What is required, then, is not prudence but patience."""
266,"Still, investors expect more members of the Fed to get behind rate hikes on Wednesday."
267,"The central bank's ""dot plot,"" which charts interest rate expectations, will be scrutinized."
268,"""I would be very surprised if there aren't more dots talking about rate increases next year,"" Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday."
269,"Wall Street's mood: Gorman thinks that when rates start to rise, financial markets ""may have a setback for a little bit."""

275,"See here: On its most recent earnings call, the company said it expected sales of its coronavirus vaccine to reach $36 billion this year."
276,The scramble for booster shots as wealthy countries try to keep the Omicron variant at bay could provide another lift.
277,But it's not the only development investors are monitoring.

 Here's a rare piece of holiday cheer in a year of screwed-up supply chains: Shipments and deliveries are moving fairly well
 Deliveries of packages by UPS, FedEx and the US Postal Service are all moving at close to 100% on-time performance, according to data from ShipMatrix, a software provider that works with parcel shippers."
288,"It's a pleasant surprise, even for those who anticipated that those services would be well prepared for the holiday season, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports."
289,"""If you operate at the peak, that's tremendous,"" said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix."
290,"""I was expecting [the performance rate] to be in the mid-90s."""
291,"Jindel attributes the better-than-expected results to three factors: 1) carriers, foreseeing problems, added capacity, 2) more consumers are buying in stores, and 3) people knew there were supply chain problems and shopped early."
292,A survey conducted for UPS earlier this year found that 91% of consumers planned to complete their holiday shopping one week before Christmas compared to 81% last year.
293,"And about 60% of consumers aimed to finish shopping two weeks before the holiday, up from 52% in 2020."
294,There's more: Shipping companies are actually moving more boxes.
295,"FedEx said it expects to handle 100,000 more packages this holiday season than it did in 2019."

 Omicron and inflation have left Wall Street on edge in recent days, and investors are anxious about how the Federal Reserve will lay out its plan to navigate these twin economic threats as policymakers wrap up their final meeting of the year on Wednesday."
304,"Data released last week found that consumer inflation hit a four-decade high, and the Department of Labor reported Tuesday that wholesale prices jumped at a record rate of 9.6 percent from a year ago."
305,"“I think it’s the impact on the broader population that’s really the Fed’s challenge,” said Stephen Lee, principal of Logan Capital Management."
306,"In recent comments, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was renominated last month to lead the Fed for another four years, has retreated from describing price increases as “transitory.” There is widespread expectation that he will use his Wednesday afternoon press conference to announce that the Fed will wrap up its pandemic-era bond-buying program more quickly than it initially planned."
307,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Nov. 30, 2021."
308,"Andrew Harnik / AP
 “I’m expecting a substantially more hawkish tone heading into Wednesday,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager and analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors."
309,"“Inflation is real right now.”
 For the past year and a half, the Fed has bought $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, part of a strategy to stabilize the financial system when it was feared that global shutdowns resulting from Covid-19 could trigger an economic collapse."
310,"The Fed initially advanced a six-month timeframe for the wind-down, but there are indications that it might adopt a faster pace, possibly concluding in March rather than in June."
311,"A speedier wind-down likely points to earlier rate hikes, action on which market expectations have changed considerably in recent months: As recently as March, the Fed wasn’t expected to raise its benchmark rate from its current near-zero level until 2024."
312,"Now, those same projections call for as many as three quarter-percent rate hikes in 2022 alone, implying a Fed funds rate of between 0.75 and 1 percent."
313,Current projections call for as many as three rate hikes in 2022.
314,"“I think the markets are predicting that the Fed’s hands will be forced to raise rates earlier and faster than previously expected,” said Dan North, senior economist at Euler Hermes North America."
315,“This is just a reaction from the Fed as they’ve seen this trade off between growth and inflation worsen.
316,"They’re forced into difficult decisions,” said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Abrdn, because of the unique distortions the pandemic has imposed on the economy."
317,"Policymakers have offset previous macroeconomic shocks in the past by increasing the money supply and adopting more accommodative positions, but that playbook isn’t a go-to this time around."
318,"The Fed can’t do anything about factory shutdowns in Asia or container ships queued up off the coast of California, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird."
319,"“A lot of the inflationary pressures are on the supply side of the equation, which the Fed can’t do much about,” he said."
320,Dysfunction in D.C. also doesn’t help.
321,“You’ve got policy uncertainty as well as Covid uncertainty.
322,"It really makes the Fed’s job a little more challenging,” Lee said, pointing to the ongoing wrangling in Washington."
323,"Some lawmakers, primarily but not exclusively Republicans, have criticized President Biden’s Build Back Better economic agenda, saying that the roughly $1.7 trillion package would contribute to inflation by pouring more money into an economy that already shows signs of overheating and as well as putting more pressure on already-strained supply chains, which could exacerbate the climbing costs for a growing list of goods and services."
324,"Different studies have produced a variety of conclusions, and analysts likewise are split on the likely impact — particularly given the uncertainty around the extent and duration of supply-chain issues moving into the new year."
325,"Ethan Harris, head of global economics research for Bank of America, warned in a new report that adding demand in an economy already facing tight supplies of both materials and labor could drive prices up further."
326,"“In our opinion, the proposed increases in investment would stimulate demand more than supply in the short run, creating inflationary risks,” he wrote, although he noted that the ultimate impact could differ depending on what the final legislation includes."
327,"Harris also called the Build Back Better Act “quite progressive in the short run,” though."
328,He noted that lower-income families would benefit from multiple new tax credits — which would achieve a key goal of the platform advanced by Biden’s economic team.
329,President Joe Biden is taking the political punches for high inflation.
330,"But price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, not the White House."
331,And prices are anything but stable right now.
332,New York (CNN Business) President Joe Biden is taking the political punches for high inflation.
333,"But price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, not the White House."
334,And prices are anything but stable right now.
335,The good news is that the Federal Reserve knows how to fight inflation : By tapping the brakes on the economy.
336,"The bad news is the harder it hits the brakes, the greater the risk of an accident that ends the economic recovery, freaks out financial markets -- or both."
337,"""The Fed knows what to do, but they don't necessarily know how to do it without squashing the economy,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told CNN."
338,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, fresh off his renomination by Biden, will attempt to assure Wall Street, Washington and the public at large on Wednesday there's no reason to panic about sticker shock."
339,Powell must promise to get inflation under control -- but do so without removing support so quickly that the recovery stalls out.
340,It's a difficult needle to thread.
341,"""Pressures on the Fed now are intensifying and enormous,"" David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, told CNN in an email."
342,"'He's got to fall on his sword'
 Powell's task is complicated by how wrong the Fed and the consensus among economists has been."
343,Very few people expected inflation at the end of 2021 to be this hot for this long.
344,"Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, told CBS the Fed's characterization of inflation as transitory ""is probably the worst inflation call in the history of the Federal Reserve."""
345,"""Powell needs to eat his words."
346,He's got to fall on his sword.
347,"Inflation is no longer transitory,"" said Shalett."
348,"New numbers out on Tuesday showed that producer prices, those charged by suppliers to businesses, spiked by 9.6% from a year ago."
349,That's the highest on record since the government started tracking this metric in 2010.
350,"""These are provocative numbers, by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Shalett, who added she's more concerned about inflation today than at any point during her three-decade career on Wall Street."
351,"Negative feedback loop
 Biden has acknowledged that high inflation is squeezing families."
352,But he's also argued that inflation is peaking now.
353,That may very well be the case.
354,Many economists do think inflation will cool off in 2022 and that the price spike may be at or near a peak.
355,But it's very hard to accurately forecast anything in the Covid economy.
356,"And even if the worst of inflation is over soon, that doesn't mean prices will automatically revert back to healthy levels."
357,Inflation was very tame in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
358,"For years, the Fed fretted that inflation was too low."
359,Falling prices are scary for central bankers because it's very difficult to escape a deflationary spiral.
360,But Covid has changed that.
361,"Supply chain bottlenecks, worker shortages and surging demand as the world recovers from the pandemic have set off a bout of inflation."
362,Consumer prices are up by 5% or more during each of the past six months.
363,That's nowhere near the Fed's goal for roughly 2% inflation.
364,"""The more persistent it is, the more likely it becomes embedded in the economy."
365,"That's what is troubling in the recent inflation prints,"" Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, told CNN."
366,"If everyone starts to anticipate higher prices, they will change their behavior."
367,Workers will demand higher and higher wages.
368,Consumers will pull forward their purchases.
369,And all of that will add further pressure on inflation.
370,It becomes a negative feedback loop.
371,"""It starts to enter the psychology of the economy,"" said Harris."
372,"How the Fed can fight inflation
 Unlike deflation, the Fed knows it can address inflation by raising the cost of money."
373,"In this case, that means unwinding the Fed's bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, or QE."
374,"Despite the booming economy and red-hot inflation, up until very recently the Fed was buying a staggering $120 billion of mortgage and Treasury bonds a month."
375,But that program is only piling pressure on inflation and Powell has signaled a willingness to speed up the demise of QE.
376,"Look for the Fed to endorse a faster ""taper"" of QE on Wednesday."
377,And Fed officials will likely signal that interest rates will have to rise off rock-bottom levels to combat inflation.
378,"Wall Street is pricing in at least two interest rate hikes next year, a big reversal from earlier this year when many assumed the Fed could stay at zero until 2023."
379,"Current Fed policy (zero rates and massive QE) is ""insane"" given inflationary pressures and the strength of the underlying economy, Shalett said."
380,"The Volcker playbook
 Paul Volcker, the legendary former chairman of the Fed, tamed the runaway inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s by dramatically raising interest rates."
381,"While Volcker's success earned him a place in the history books, what often gets overlooked today is the economic pain those rate hikes inflicted on the economy."
382,"Under Volcker, interest rates skyrocketed to an unprecedented 20%, crushing the economy by raising the cost of everything from mortgages, small business loans and car loans."
383,"""Everyone talks about Paul Volcker as a hero."
384,"But the United States economy was in a double-dip recession between 1981 and 1984,"" said Shalett."
385,"""Everyone has said this is not the 1970s."
386,"But I don't know that we know that for sure."""
387,"Curiously, the bond markets are not freaking out about the high inflation readings."
388,"The 10-year Treasury rate stands at about 1.45% today, down from 1.7% in mid-October."
389,"Kotok, the Cumberland Advisors chairman, said the bond market is more concerned about the Fed overreacting to today's hot inflation readings than it is about the hot inflation readings themselves."
390,And Kotok shares that concern.
391,"""I fear a policy error that goes too far, too fast and throws the US economy into a slowdown or recession,"" Kotok said."
392,"""History suggests that is a very real possibility."""
393,The Federal Reserve is set to announce its plans Wednesday afternoon.
394,"Image Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times
 Federal Reserve officials are shifting their focus away from bolstering the economic recovery and toward trying to guard against out-of-control inflation, and on Wednesday they are expected to announce they are hastening plans to cut their policy help."
395,"Policymakers are wrapping up their final gathering of 2021, and are widely expected to signal a faster end to the bond-buying campaign they have used to keep money flowing through financial markets and support the economy since the early days of the pandemic."
396,They could also telegraph that they expect to raise rates from rock-bottom more rapidly than they projected just a few months ago.
397,"The potential for major policy signals at the Fed’s meeting, which concludes at 2 p.m. Wednesday, will make it one of the most closely watched of the pandemic era."
398,"Officials took their first step toward weaning the economy off the central bank’s support in November, when they said they would begin to slow a large-scale bond-buying program that had been in place since early in the pandemic to keep money flowing around markets and support the economy."
399,"In the weeks since the Fed’s last meeting, fresh data has showed that consumer prices are climbing rapidly and the unemployment rate is falling swiftly as the economy heals."
400,"Given inflation and growth trends, Fed officials made clear ahead of their December meeting that they planned to discuss withdrawing support more quickly, and economists think officials will on Wednesday signal a plan to taper off bond purchases so that the buying will stop altogether in March."
401,"Wall Street investors will also eagerly watch both the Fed’s quarterly economic projections and the post-meeting news conference by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for any hint at when and how rapidly policymakers expect to lift interest rates away from near-zero, where they have been set since March 2020."
402,Here’s what to watch in the announcement.
403,"Quicker end to bond buying: Economists expect that the Fed will speed up its retreat from its bond-buying program, doubling the monthly slowdown in purchases by $15 billion, so that the central bank is buying $30 billion less each month."
404,That would mean that the purchases would end altogether ahead of the central bank’s March meeting.
405,"Interest rate projections: Several Fed officials have signaled that they would prefer to wait until the bond-buying program ends to lift interest rates, their more traditional and powerful tool for cooling off the economy."
406,"By gearing up to stop bond buying sooner, the Fed could put itself in a position to raise interest rates earlier, should officials decide that higher rates are necessary to cool off consumer demand and weigh down inflation."
407,"Policymakers could also offer hints about when rate increases might start and how quickly they will proceed in their so-called dot plot, which shows officials’ anonymous projections of where interest rates will be set in coming years."
408,Many economists expect the plot to show two to three increases in 2022.
409,Powell’s stance: The Fed chair signaled late last month that the central bank was shifting toward a more wary stance when it comes to inflation.
410,"But those comments were made before fresh data was released, including last week’s report that showed consumer prices rising at the fastest pace since 1982."
411,"Producer prices are climbing briskly and the labor market continues to recover, and Mr. Powell’s interpretation of those metrics will be closely watched."
412,"So, too, will any hint about what it all means for interest rates down the road."
413,Meeting the full employment test: One big question lingering on the Fed’s horizon is what full employment might look like in 2022.
414,"After months of stagnation, pandemic-depressed labor force participation showed signs of picking up in November."
415,"If officials want to see more recovery, it could mean that reaching maximum employment will take longer as sidelined workers slowly trickle back."
416,"If, on the other hand, they just want to see a lower unemployment rate, that trend is well in train."
417,"Joblessness is already down to 4.2 percent, compared with a peak of 14.8 percent early in the pandemic."
418,The Fed has said that it wants to see inflation above 2 percent on a sustained basis — a goal officials have suggested has been more than achieved — and maximum employment before raising rates.
419,"With one target met, the second one is the factor to watch."
