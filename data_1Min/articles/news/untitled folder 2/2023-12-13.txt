Wall Street's major averages on Wednesday hovered just above the flatline ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision
Wall Street's major averages on Wednesday hovered just above the flatline ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision. A market rally built upon a consensus that rate hikes are done will be tested as traders wait to see what chief Jerome Powell has to say.
Approaching mid-day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) was higher by 0.12% to 14,551.19 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) added 0.14% to 4,650.15 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) inched up 0.03% to 36,587.67 points.
Of the 11 S&P sectors, seven were in the green, led by Utilities.
The central bank's monetary policy committee is pretty much a lock-in to hold steady on rates. The focus is on Powell's comments and whether he will talk about rate cuts. Attention will also be on the updated dot plot of economic and rate projections. With inflation data and labor market indicators trending in a favorable direction since the last Fed meeting, markets have aggressively priced in more than 100 basis points of rate cuts in 2024.
"Although 2023 didn’t bring the scale of hikes we saw in 2022, the Fed still surprised markets in a hawkish direction. Not only did they lift the fed funds by 100bps, which was more than the 63.8bps priced at the start of the year, they also didn’t deliver any cuts at all, with markets expecting 38.5bps at the start of 2023, albeit from a lower peak," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.
"Although we haven’t had cuts yet, tonight is still likely to be an important milestone, since the dot plot is expected to shift in a dovish direction for the first time since the pandemic. Specifically, if our U.S. economists’ forecasts are right, then the dots for 2023-25 will be slightly lower than they were in September," Reid added.
"Powell 'holding rates steady. Although progress has been made in lowering inflation it is too soon to declare victory. The Fed will continue to hold rates higher for longer and will observe data for future policy decisions' - I wrote this for him. Keep our day simple," Ross Gerber, co-founder and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, weighed in on X (formerly Twitter).
Another batch of encouraging inflation data was published before the opening bell, with the producer price index (PPI) for November coming in unchanged. Economists had expected a 0.1% rise. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was also unchanged. The PPI data comes a day after November's consumer price index reading came in a shade higher than anticipated.
"Today’s PPI data indicate that core (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will run south of core CPI over the month. The Fed will need to revise its core PCE estimates down, hastening a cut in the federal funds rate," Renaissance Macro said.
Additionally, the Atlanta Fed's gauge of business inflation expectations for December ticked lower.
Treasury yields were lower, a day after a $21B 30-year note auction showed a marked improvement in demand from the previous auction, which had tailed by its biggest margin ever. The 30-year yield (US30Y) was down 4 basis points to 4.26%, while the 10-year yield (US10Y) was down 5 basis points to 4.15%. The shorter-end more rate-sensitive 2-year yield (US2Y) was down 6 basis points to 4.67%.

Turning to Wednesday's active movers, Pfizer (PFE) was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 (SP500), after the pharmaceutical giant's updated guidance which included the impact of its acquisition of Seagen (SGEN), disappointed investors.
E-commerce firm Etsy (ETSY) was another top S&P percentage loser after it said it would layoff 11% of its workforce.


The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep rates where they are into 2024.

STORY: U.S. stocks inched up on Monday but managed to close at new highs for the year, ahead of potentially-major market-moving factors this week that include inflation readings and the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.The Dow and S&P 500 rose about four tenths of one percent while the Nasdaq added two tenths.Market-watchers increasingly believe the central bank is done with its interest rate hike cycle and could potentially cut rates in the first half of next year. Toews Asset Management CEO Phil Toews said that and lower yields on 10-year treasuries are contributing to the positive sentiment on Wall Street.“Yeah, so sometimes it's not what the good news is that causes a rally, but rather a lack of bad news. And I think that's where we are right now. Certainly the fact that the Fed has been on hold and we hope that they stay on hold. And that the 10 year and other rates have come in so considerably from the high of five on the 10 year as an example, you know the the the decrease in things like the 10 year is the equivalent over the past three weeks to the Fed lowering about 90 basis points. So it's a significant change as significant kind of easing in the economy that. Creates an environment where stocks can drift higher. “Investors will watch the Consumer Price Index data due on Tuesday, which is expected to show headline inflation remaining unchanged in November, followed by the Producer Price Index and the last interest rate decision of the year from the Fed on Wednesday.Stocks on the move included chipmaker Broadcom which jumped nine percent after Citigroup resumed coverage of the shares with a buy rating.While Cigna soared 17 percent after it ended it takeover bid for rival Humana and announced a $10 billion share buyback plan.And Macy’s surged 19 percent after an investor group made a nearly $6 billion offer to take the chain private, according to a source.


Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year in the nation’s capital to set monetary policy based on the Fed’s two macroeconomic goals of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices.
Washington, DC CNN —
The Federal Reserve has a lot of sway over the US economy and financial markets. But there’s one thing it doesn’t have: the ability to get interest rates to the exact level it wants.
How could that be? Doesn’t the Federal Reserve control interest rates?
Actually, no, it doesn’t.
While you may have read that Fed officials voted to raise, lower or hold interest rates steady after their monetary policy meeting, what they’ve actually voted on is the target range for the federal funds rate.
That range determines the actions the central bank will take behind the scenes through the use of its multitrillion-dollar balance sheet to influence borrowing costs across the economy on everything from mortgages to commercial loans.
Here’s how that all works:
An overview of monetary policy
Monetary policy is meant to either restrict or stimulate the economy, depending on whether inflation is too high or employment is too low. The Fed has been trying to slow the economy to combat high inflation for about a year and a half now through a series of rate hikes.
The Fed’s main tool — the federal funds rate — is the interest rate that commercial banks charge each other when lending excess bank reserves, which are cash minimums a financial institution is required to have on hand and is calculated as a certain percentage of a bank’s total deposits.
The Fed’s benchmark lending rate is currently at a range of 5.25-5.5%, the highest in 22 years.
Bank reserves, parked at the Fed or stored in a bank’s own vaults, are required to meet depositors’ needs in case of unexpected demand for withdrawals, and can be easily converted into cash. Banks lend each other these reserves because it is a quick way to move cash from one bank to another.
For example, if a bank in California wants to transfer money to a bank in Florida, the California bank can easily instruct the Fed to move reserves from its account at the central bank to the account of the Florida bank and, voilà, the money is quickly transferred overnight and made available to the bank.
How exactly does the Fed move the target range?
The Fed pays interest on bank reserves. That rate, which is determined by the Fed’s Board of Governors, helps the central bank carry out its desired target range because it puts a floor on the interest rate banks will be willing to accept to lend to other banks.
For instance, if the Fed pays more interest on bank reserves it means banks can earn more money from holding on to funds as opposed to lending them out. Therefore, the banks will demand higher interest rates to lend to one another. That then means banks will have to charge higher interest rates on loans they make to consumers and businesses.
The Fed gets the money to pay banks interest on reserves by trading mainly Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
To reduce the supply of bank reserves, the Fed sells the Treasury securities in its portfolio, causing bank reserves in the banking system to decline equally, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained in a book published last year.
“With fewer reserves available, the rate (price) that banks paid to borrow reserves from each other naturally rose, as intended by the (Fed),” he said.
And to lower the funds rate, the Fed does the opposite: The Fed gobbles up Treasuries, increasing the supply of bank reserves in the system, thus lowering the central bank’s benchmark lending rate.
After raising the funds rate 11 times since March 2022, the Fed has made significant progress in slowing decades-high inflation, which erupted in 2021 as a result of pandemic-driven demand and supply shocks.
Still, inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% target, and the central bank will continue to utilize its tried-and-true policy tool until the job is done. Investors are expecting rate cuts as soon as next year’s first quarter.
The Fed is holding its last two-day monetary policy meeting of the year this week, with an announcement on rates due Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by a press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is drifting near its all-time high ahead of an afternoon announcement from the Federal Reserve that could show whether all the optimism is warranted. The S&P 500 was 0.1% higher Wednesday, just 3.
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is drifting near its all-time high ahead of an afternoon announcement from the Federal Reserve that could show whether all the optimism is warranted. The S&P 500 was 0.1% higher Wednesday, just 3.1% below its record set early last year. The Dow was down 6 points, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher. Big Tech stocks were helping to lead the way as Treasury yields eased after a report showed inflation at the wholesale level was a touch cooler than expected. The Fed in the afternoon will release projections showing where policy makers expect interest rates to head.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Wall Street inched up modestly Wednesday ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on interest rates.
Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials each rose about 0.1% before the opening bell.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed to its highest level since early 2022, slightly below its record high, after a report showed inflation in the United States is behaving pretty much as expected. That has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will stand pat on interest rates when it announces its next move Wednesday afternoon.
The inflation report showed U.S. consumers paid prices for gasoline, food and other living costs last month that were 3.1% higher overall than a year earlier, slightly below October’s 3.2% inflation and exactly in line with economists’ expectations.
The Fed has already yanked its main interest rate from virtually zero early last year to more than 5.25%, its highest level since 2001. It’s hoping to slow the economy and hurt investment prices by exactly the right amount: enough to stamp out high inflation but not so much that it causes a steep recession.
In early trading Wednesday, Pfizer fell more than 7% after the drugmaker issued sales and profit forecasts for next year that are short of Wall Street's targets. Sales of Pfizer’s COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid and the vaccine Comirnaty slid 97% and 70%, respectively, during the most recent quarter as Pfizer and other pharma companies switched to selling on the commercial market rather than to governments.
Tesla is recalling nearly every vehicle it's sold in the U.S., more than 2 million vehicles, to roll out a software update to fix a defective system that’s supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when they use Autopilot. Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the company will send out a software update to fix the problems.
Tesla shares are down about 1% before the bell.
In Europe at midday, Germany's DAX gained 0.2% and the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3%. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
In Asian trading, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.3% to 32,926.35 after the Bank of Japan's quarterly “tankan” report, released Wednesday, showed business sentiment among major manufacturers improved for a third straight quarter.
Shares in China declined on what analysts said was disappointment over a lack of major stimulus measures from a major economic planning conference that ended on Tuesday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% to 16,228.75 and the Shanghai Composite index was down 1.2% at 2,968.76. South Korea's Kospi lost 1% to 2,510.66.
The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.3% at 7,257.80. Taiwan's Taiex edged 0.1% higher and Bangkok's SET lost 1.3%.
In other trading Wednesday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude reversed course and picked up 54 cents to $69.15 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Tuesday, it lost $2.71 to settle at $68.61.
Crude was trading above $93 in September but has tumbled more than 22% in the past three months as economies across the globe begin to slow. Crude prices are down 9% this month.
Brent crude, the international standard, added 28 cents to $73.52 per barrel. It fell $2.79 on Tuesday to $73.24 per barrel.
The U.S. dollar rose to 145.69 Japanese yen from 145.45 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0784 from $1.0793.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to just below its all-time high set in early 2022. The Dow added 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is drifting near its all-time high ahead of an afternoon announcement from the Federal Reserve that could show whether all the optimism is warranted. The S&P 500 was 0.1% higher Wednesday, just 3.
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is drifting near its all-time high ahead of an afternoon announcement from the Federal Reserve that could show whether all the optimism is warranted. The S&P 500 was 0.1% higher Wednesday, just 3.1% below its record set early last year. The Dow was down 6 points, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher. Big Tech stocks were helping to lead the way as Treasury yields eased after a report showed inflation at the wholesale level was a touch cooler than expected. The Fed in the afternoon will release projections showing where policy makers expect interest rates to head.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Wall Street inched up modestly Wednesday ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on interest rates.
Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials each rose about 0.1% before the opening bell.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 climbed to its highest level since early 2022, slightly below its record high, after a report showed inflation in the United States is behaving pretty much as expected. That has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will stand pat on interest rates when it announces its next move Wednesday afternoon.
The inflation report showed U.S. consumers paid prices for gasoline, food and other living costs last month that were 3.1% higher overall than a year earlier, slightly below October’s 3.2% inflation and exactly in line with economists’ expectations.
The Fed has already yanked its main interest rate from virtually zero early last year to more than 5.25%, its highest level since 2001. It’s hoping to slow the economy and hurt investment prices by exactly the right amount: enough to stamp out high inflation but not so much that it causes a steep recession.
In early trading Wednesday, Pfizer fell more than 7% after the drugmaker issued sales and profit forecasts for next year that are short of Wall Street's targets. Sales of Pfizer’s COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid and the vaccine Comirnaty slid 97% and 70%, respectively, during the most recent quarter as Pfizer and other pharma companies switched to selling on the commercial market rather than to governments.
Tesla is recalling nearly every vehicle it's sold in the U.S., more than 2 million vehicles, to roll out a software update to fix a defective system that’s supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when they use Autopilot. Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the company will send out a software update to fix the problems.
Tesla shares are down about 1% before the bell.
In Europe at midday, Germany's DAX gained 0.2% and the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.3%. Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
In Asian trading, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.3% to 32,926.35 after the Bank of Japan's quarterly “tankan” report, released Wednesday, showed business sentiment among major manufacturers improved for a third straight quarter.
Shares in China declined on what analysts said was disappointment over a lack of major stimulus measures from a major economic planning conference that ended on Tuesday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.9% to 16,228.75 and the Shanghai Composite index was down 1.2% at 2,968.76. South Korea's Kospi lost 1% to 2,510.66.

The article discusses the Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decision, COP28's historic deal to shift away from fossil fuels, the latest CPI report, and Microsoft's AI updates.
Fed watch
Some day, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions may once again be like watching paint dry. We're not there yet. To be sure, very few see any chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will change the federal funds rate target range from its current 5.25%-5.50% level at the end of its meeting on Wednesday. Market participants will focus on when the Fed will start cutting rates, and will look for clues in the policymakers' dot plot and in Chair Jerome Powell's language during his press conference.
Market expectations: In September's Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for the fed funds rate was 5.1% at the end of 2024, implying one rate cut. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Brian Rehling pointed out in a recent note that markets are expecting four or five 25-bp rate cuts in 2024, a significant disconnect from the Fed's last SEP. "Therefore, in our view, either market expectations or Fed policy messaging will have to adjust in the future," he wrote.
David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, will be listening for a change in language to see how confident the FOMC is regarding its control of inflation. "We’ll know we have a soft landing when the Fed believes inflation is done and gives a sense that they are no longer wanting to be restrictive," he said in an interview. He had expected a Q1 rate cut, but after Tuesday's CPI print showing an increase in used vehicle and housing prices, he said: "A March rate cut may now require more substantial slowing in the real economy and labor market."
SA commentary: SA analyst Logan Kane warned that the Fed may throw traders a curveball. "Given where inflation is now, the Fed may be willing to hold rates steady for all of 2024, or even consider hiking if inflation doesn't cooperate. Traders likely would not like to hear this." Investing Group Leader Lawrence Fuller also cautioned traders, saying: "The consensus of investors sees short-term rates closer to 4.1%, and this is where the Fed may intentionally disappoint to cap the rally that is rapidly loosening financial conditions.

COP28 deal
Nearly 200 countries at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai have agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a first of its kind deal that will likely usher in the end of the fossil fuel era. The deal had to be revised after the initial draft faced opposition from some countries as it didn't include strong enough wording on phasing out fossil fuels. The new pact also calls for tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030 and substantially reducing methane emissions. "We're standing here in an oil country, surrounded by oil countries, and we made the decision to move away from oil and gas," said Danish Minister for Climate and Energy Dan Jorgensen on the historic agreement.

Inflation gauge
The Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1% in November, exceeding the 0.0% rate expected, according to the Department of Labor. Sliding gasoline prices helped keep the headline number in check, offsetting gains in shelter, food, and medical care. CPI increased 3.1% Y/Y, just under the 3.2% expected. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3% M/M and 4.0% Y/Y, as expected. "Markets embraced the 3.1% CPI increase, which matched expectations," said Investing Group Leader Chris Lau, as all three major indices ended in the green. Rate expectations were largely unchanged, with most economists still expecting the first rate cut to happen in May. SA analyst Lawrence Fuller believes the CPI data signals that the war against inflation is over. (227 comments)
Powering AI
Microsoft (MSFT) is training generative artificial intelligence to help speed up regulatory approvals for nuclear power, which can take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The software giant foresees a massive need for electricity as it pushes deeper into supercomputing and AI, and nuclear power is seen as a way to provide electricity more consistently than renewables. In other news, Microsoft's AI model Phi-2 is now capable of outperforming rival models from Meta Platforms (META) and others. "With only 2.7B parameters, Phi-2 surpasses the performance of Mistral and Llama-2 models at 7B and 13B parameters on various aggregated benchmarks," said Microsoft. (31 comments)


The Fed’s 19-member policy committee will also issue its quarterly economic projections, which include estimates of unemployment, inflation and growth over the next three years

Will the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate some time next year – and, if so, by how much?
Wall Street investors have been obsessed with such questions since a top Fed official hinted last month that rate cuts were at least possible as early as March. When its latest policy meeting ends Wednesday, the Fed will provide some highly anticipated hints about the extent of rate cuts next year. In the meantime, it’s set to leave its benchmark rate unchanged for the third straight time.
The Fed’s 19-member policy committee will also issue its quarterly economic projections, which include estimates of unemployment, inflation and growth over the next three years. Of most interest to Fed watchers, the projections include a forecast of how the central bank may adjust its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, over that period.
The average of all 19 forecasts will almost surely point to some rate cuts during 2024. Most economists expect Fed officials to project two, or possibly three, reductions.
Wall Street traders, who tend to be more optimistic, have bet on four rate cuts, according to futures markets, down from a prediction of five a few weeks ago. Their hopes for cuts were fuelled last month when Christopher Waller, a leading Fed official who had pushed for higher rates since inflation erupted in 2021, surprisingly suggested that the Fed might decide to cut rates as early as spring if inflation kept falling.
With inflation mostly easing now, that would be a lower bar for rate cuts than the most likely alternative scenario: A sharp economic slowdown that could prompt even faster rate reductions. So far, though, there is no sign that a downturn is imminent.
Rate cuts by the Fed would reduce borrowing costs across the economy, making mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, among other forms of credit, less expensive. Stock prices could rise, too, though share prices have already rallied in expectation of rate cuts, potentially limiting any further increases.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has recently downplayed the idea that rate reductions are nearing. Powell hasn’t yet even signalled that the Fed is conclusively done with its hikes. Speaking recently at Spelman College in Atlanta, the Fed chair cautioned that “it would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to fully defeat inflation. He also said it was too soon to “speculate” about rate cuts.
Still, if the Fed leaves rates unchanged Wednesday, as expected, it would be the third straight time it has done so, lending weight to the widespread assumption that rate hikes are over. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed raised its key rate 11 times, to about 5.4 per cent, the highest level in 22 years.
Typically, once the Fed has finished raising rates, attention quickly shifts to the question of when rate cuts will follow. Historically, on average, rate reductions have occurred less than a year after rate hikes have ended.
One reason the Fed might be able to cut rates next year, even if the economy plows ahead, would be if inflation kept falling, as expected. A steady slowdown in price increases would have the effect of raising inflation-adjusted interest rates, thereby making borrowing costs higher than the Fed intends. Reducing rates, in this scenario, would simply keep inflation-adjusted borrowing costs from rising.
Recent economic data have modestly cooled financial markets’ expectations for early rate cuts. Last week’s jobs report for November showed that the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 per cent, near a half-century low, down from 3.9 per cent as businesses engaged in solid hiring. Such a low unemployment rate could force companies to keep raising pay to find and retain workers, which would fuel inflationary pressures.
And consumer prices were mostly unchanged last month, the government said Tuesday, suggesting that while inflation is likely headed back to the Fed’s 2 per cent target, it might take longer than optimists expect. The central bank, as a result, could opt to keep rates at their current level to try to ensure that prices resume their downward path.


The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged in its policy announcement due later in the day
Oil prices slid to six-month lows on Wednesday and world shares killed time ahead of the year’s final Federal Reserve policy decision and clues about the timing of next year’s rate cuts.
Traders also were digesting the impact of an agreement from the COP 28 climate summit to begin reducing global consumption of fossil fuels, as well as Argentina’s plan to weaken its peso over 50%, cut energy subsidies and cancel tenders of public works.
Brent bottomed at $72.51 a barrel, its lowest since late June. U.S. crude slid to $68.71 a barrel on concerns of softening demand as global economic growth slows, and oversupply after the U.S. Energy Information Administration raised its forecast for U.S. supply in 2023 by 300,000 barrels per day, and a jump in shipments of Russian crude.
MSCI’s broadest index of shares around the world was flat on the day, resting around its highest level since early August.
A jump past July’s top, less than 1% away, would take the benchmark to a 20-month high, having been boosted in recent weeks by expectations of meaningful interest rate cuts next year, while economic growth in the U.S. remains resilient.
The Fed takes centre stage on Wednesday, where it is due to announce its rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting.
Markets are all but certain policymakers will keep rates on hold, expectations that Tuesday’s U.S. inflation data, largely in line with consensus, did nothing to alter.
That leaves the attention on Powell’s press conference and the Fed’s dot plot of future policy trajectory, to see how far it diverges from markets current pricing of over 100 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by the end of next year.
“We need to be focused on what the Fed - and ECB - are going to say, and what pushback to current pricing we’ll get. Fundamentals justify a recalibration of monetary policy, but not the extent that is priced in,” said Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier.
The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Norges Bank and the Swiss National Bank meet on Thursday.
European shares edged higher with the broad STOXX benchmark up 0.2% trading around its highest since February 2022, with the German and French benchmarks both around record highs.
U.S. share futures ticked higher after U.S. stocks closed on Tuesday at fresh highs of the year and the Cboe Volatility Index dropped to a near four year low.
ARGENTINA
Eyes were also on Argentina where Economy Minister Luis Caputo launched economic shock therapy aimed at fixing the country’s worst crisis in decades.
Sharp moves in Argentine peso “non-deliverable” forwards on Wednesday suggested traders were betting the peso’s value would continue to dive after the country’s new government said it would devalue currency by over 50% to 800 per dollar.
“Our first impression of the announcement is positive. Fiscal profligacy is the root of Argentina’s macroeconomic problems and moving swiftly with the fiscal adjustment is utmost important,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.
In Britain, data showed the economy shrank in October, raising the risk of a recession and testing the Bank of England’s resolve to stick to its tough anti-inflation line against cutting interest rates from their 15-year high.
Rate-sensitive, two-year gilt yields were down nearly 5 basis points at 4.45%, their lowest in around a month, and the pound dropped 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2562, also softening against the euro.
Germany’s two-year yield was flat on the day at 2.71%, and the two-year Treasury yield was steady at 4.722%, having earlier in December hit a roughly six-month trough of 4.540%.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield steadied at 4.2063%, not far from its lowest in three months. [US/]
Chinese markets on Wednesday had their chance to react to an agenda-setting meeting of China’s top leaders, following which state media said after market close on Tuesday Beijing would step up policy adjustments to support an economic recovery in 2024.
Chinese blue-chip stocks sank 1.7% on Wednesday, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.9%, as the absence of strong stimulus measures at the Central Economic Work Conference left investors disappointed.
In commodity markets, gold slipped to a more than three-week low of $1,973.35 an ounce.

Market awaits Federal Reserve's decision on future rate cuts, with expectations rising for cuts in March and May. Click here to read more.

Fed Watch
The last meeting of the year for the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee will determine if the broad rally for stocks and bonds will be sustained and make it to January or be reined in and pulled back.
While the Fed has indicated it does not need to raise rates at this point, it is the timing of future rate cuts that the market is more interested in. Expectations for a rate cut have risen to ~42% in March 2024 as per the CME's FedWatch tool. For May, the expectations have soared to 50% for a 25 basis points rate cut, while another 25% expecting a rate cut of 50 basis points. That's a marked shift with such optimism for a rate cut feeding the rally.
The Fed's Summary of Economic Projections and its dot plot will be scrutinized for any shift toward less restrictive policy. The dot plot is updated quarterly and shows, by way of individual dots, an assessment of each policymaker's midpoint level of the target range for the Federal Funds rate at the end of the year.
Fed Not Likely to Talk Up Rate Cuts Next Year
The Federal Reserve is looking for reassurance that inflation has been tamed and is on an inexorable path down to the desired range. Presently, the data-dependent Fed is not there because the data itself is not there.
The core inflation rate for November, announced earlier today (Tuesday), was 4%, still twice the ~2% level desired by the Fed.
CPI and Core CPI (CNBC, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, edits by GraycellAdvisors.com)
While the inflation data has been trending lower, the pace at which inflation has been declining has moderated. Over the past 3 months, core inflation change in monthly prices has been holding steady near a 3.6% rate.
CPI and Core CPI (WSJ, Labor Department, edits by GraycellAdvisors.com)
The Fed is worried about declaring a premature victory and signaling a shift to a less restrictive monetary policy. The Fed will be more reassured if core CPI, or PCE, shifts down to a new lower level and maintains that for a few months. At the present pace of inflation improvement, that may not happen for a few months.
Conclusion
The market has rebounded sharply, with speculative buying returning as rate cut expectations in May 2024 have climbed. While a cut in the second quarter may occur if economic data softens on a steep trajectory, presently it is hard to see the Fed giving any rate cut signal after its meeting other than remaining watchful for inflation. The Fed does not have the data points yet to justify a shift in its market signaling.
If there is no softening in the Fed's posture following the meeting, the market can enter a consolidation phase. However, any softening on the Fed's part can prove to be a catalyst for the stock market to reach new highs.


Economists widely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged.
The Federal Reserve will announce an interest rate decision on Wednesday, unveiling its latest policy move amid a near-historic series of rate hikes deployed to fight inflation.
That string of rate increases has coincided with a cooldown of inflation but also has elevated interest payments for everything from credit card loans to mortgages.
The announcement is set to arrive a day after the release of government data showing that price increases slowed slightly last month.
Inflation has fallen significantly from a peak of about 9% last summer but remains more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target.
Economists widely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday since inflation has moderated and some areas of the economy have shown signs of a slowing down.
Such a decision would match the choice made by the Fed at its most recent meeting in September, when the central bank paused its inflation fight amid growing optimism that the U.S. could achieve normal price levels without falling into a recession.
Many economists and observers even expect the Fed to begin instituting rate cuts as soon as next year.
Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades in an effort to slow prices increases.
The rate hikes appear to have put the brakes on the housing market and discouraged businesses from major investments that would carry onerous borrowing costs.
The economy maintained robust employment growth last month but fell well short of the breakneck pace exhibited over the previous year, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday showed.
Still, consumer spending has proven resilient. Black Friday sales did gangbuster business as the nation entered a holiday shopping season expected to test shoppers, who account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity.
Resilient holiday spending could provide additional fuel for the economy as observers hope for continued expansion but fear the downward pressure imposed by interest rate hikes.
Lately, the economy has rebuked such concerns. The gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 4.9% over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth of the previous quarter and easing worries about a possible recession, a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in October showed.
In recent months, mixed signals from the economy have complicated the Fed's effort to bring down inflation while averting a recession, an outcome known as a "soft landing."
In theory, the economy should eventually falter as it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. However, the economy has so far resisted an overall slowdown.
Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C. last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the complex economic picture faced by the central bank.
"Inflation has been coming down but it's still running well above our 2% target," Powell said. "Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the committee is proceeding carefully."
While mixed economic data creates significant uncertainty, the status of the Fed's inflation fight remains clear, Powell said, noting that the task will require a further slowdown in price increases.
"The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2% has a long way to go," Powell said. "We remain strongly committed."

Still, if the Fed leaves rates unchanged Wednesday, as expected, it would be the third straight time it has done so, lending weight to the widespread assumption that rate hikes are over. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed raised its key rate 11 times, to about 5.4%, the highest level in 22 years.
What’s happening with the economy?
Pollsters and economists say there has never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception.
Easing inflation in 2023 has raised hopes for a gentler Federal Reserve and a strong stock market in 2024. Read more.
However, small businesses have been both hopeful and anxious
Many Americans said in an AP-NORC poll that their household expenses are outpacing earnings, and they worry about their financial futures.
Typically, once the Fed has finished raising rates, attention quickly shifts to the question of when rate cuts will follow. Historically, on average, rate reductions have occurred less than a year after rate hikes have ended.
One reason the Fed might be able to cut rates next year, even if the economy plows ahead, would be if inflation kept falling, as expected.

Recent economic data have modestly cooled financial markets’ expectations for early rate cuts. Last week’s jobs report for November showed that the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, near a half-century low, down from 3.9% as businesses engaged in solid hiring. Such a low unemployment rate could force companies to keep raising pay to find and retain workers, which would fuel inflationary pressures.

The central bank, as a result, could opt to keep rates at their current level to try to ensure that prices resume their downward path.


The Federal Reserve is expected to announce Wednesday that it will keep its key interest rate steady at a 22-year high for the third time in a row. Central bank officials will also release a fresh set of economic projections, likely showing inflation cooling faster than previously estimated and an additional rate cut next year, or more.
Washington, DC CNN —
The Federal Reserve is expected to announce Wednesday that it will keep its key interest rate steady at a 22-year high for the third time in a row. Central bank officials will also release a fresh set of economic projections, likely showing inflation cooling faster than previously estimated and an additional rate cut next year, or more.
The Fed’s post-meeting statement could also suggest that the central bank isn’t leaning toward hiking again, specifically by nixing the usual “additional policy firming” phrase, though that change could also come at a future meeting.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to throw some cold water on the possibility of rate cuts beginning in just a few months, reiterating that more hikes remain on the table. He tried doing so earlier this month.
“Having come so far so quickly, the [Fed] is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,” Powell said during a discussion in Atlanta. “It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.”
But any additional rate increases aren’t reflected in futures. Stocks rallied after Powell’s hawkish comments in Atlanta. Indeed, investors are already looking ahead to the Fed cutting rates sometime next year, but when rate cuts begin remains unclear. Markets are currently pricing in a roughly 40% chance of that first rate cut coming in March.
The Fed lowers its key federal funds rate for two main reasons; because unemployment is rising due to a weakening economy, or simply because there is no reason to keep interest rates elevated at a “restrictive” level, if it’s clear that inflation is under control. In the latter scenario, with inflation slowing and rates unchanged at a high level, that would mean that inflation-adjusted, “real” interest rates are rising, unnecessarily constraining the economy.
Rate cuts are a hot topic
Fed officials’ latest economic projections released in September showed that they will begin to lower interest rates sometime next year. But it remains unclear as to when rate cuts will ultimately begin and how many times the Fed will cut in 2024. Economists’ estimates around rate cuts vary.
“The Fed is feeling increasingly comfortable that the economy, jobs and inflation are all moving in the right direction, consistent with the current federal funds rate,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN.
“But futures markets are anticipating a lot of cuts next year, beginning in March. That’s probably overly aggressive from the Fed’s point of view, so Powell may try to guide markets back to less aggressive rate cuts next year,” he said.
Whether a deteriorating economy or inflation’s defeat elicits rate cuts next year is anyone’s guess.
And with markets already sending clear signals on rate cuts, Fed officials might be discussing that during their ongoing policy meeting, which began on Tuesday.
“Powell is going to get asked whether or not they discussed rate cuts at this meeting, and that’s going to be one of the hardest things for him to navigate,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, told CNN.
“We’ll see it in the minutes, but he has to admit if they did. He’s pretty good at corralling the cats ahead of time, so my guess is that he says he will hold off on any rate cut discussions until January,” she added.
It’s also not just Powell pooh-poohing the rate cuts discourse.
“I’m not thinking about rate cuts at all right now,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told a German newspaper last month. “I’m thinking about whether we have enough tightening in the system and are sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability.”
The state of the US economy
Inflation remains a pesky problem for the Fed.
Price increases slowed slightly in November, as underlying inflationary pressures persisted, according to the Labor Department’s latest Consumer Price Index released Tuesday.
CPI rose 3.1% in November from a year earlier, a touch lower than October’s 3.2% rise and still above the Fed’s 2% target. Meanwhile, the core measure excluding volatile food and energy prices rose 4% in the 12 months ended in November, the same as October.
Still, the latest CPI reflects a substantial improvement from when it reached a four-decade high in June 2022. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge has shown the same steady progress over the past year.
The final mile of the Fed’s inflation fight could be the most difficult, possibly requiring the economy to cool further, and Powell and other Fed officials have said as much.
Economic growth has already slowed dramatically from its breakneck pace in the third quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is currently projecting fourth-quarter GDP to register at an annualized 1.2% rate, a sharp pullback from the third quarter’s red-hot 5.2%.
The job market has also slowed markedly, at least compared to the robust years of 2021 and 2022. Employers added 199,000 jobs in November as the unemployment rate edged lower to 3.7% that month. That’s above the minimum number of monthly job gains — somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 — needed to keep up with population growth.
Overall, the US economy remains resilient, steering clear of a recession so far, instead raising even more hopes that the Fed could pull off a soft landing — a situation in which inflation slows without a sharp rise in unemployment.
But a soft landing still isn’t guaranteed.
“We are seeing evidence that the economy has already essentially achieved a soft landing, if you look at three-month or six-month averages,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN. “The key question now is whether there is a sufficiently long and stable runway through 2024 where we avoid that long-feared recession.”


U.S. Treasury yields fell on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision and guidance on the monetary policy outlook.
At 3:43 a.m. ET, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was over one basis point lower to 4.1909%. The 2-year Treasury yield was last down by less than one basis point to 4.7243%.
U.S. Treasury yields fell slightly on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision and guidance on the outlook for monetary policy and the U.S. economy.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday. That would be the third time in a row that rate would be held steady.
Many investors are also hoping that the Fed will provide hints about the path for interest rates, including when it may cut rates. Policymakers have so far given few hints about this, though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this month suggested it was too soon to speculate about rate cuts.
Data released on Tuesday showed the consumer price index increased by 0.1% on a monthly and 3.1% on an annual basis in November. Economists previously surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting the CPI to be flat month over month, while the annual increase was in line with expectations.
The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, came in 0.3% higher than the previous month and was up by 4% from a year earlier.
Further inflation insights are expected Wednesday in form of the producer price index, which reflects inflation on a wholesale level. According to a Dow Jones poll, economists are expecting an increase of 0.1% for November after October's reading reflected a 0.5% decline.
