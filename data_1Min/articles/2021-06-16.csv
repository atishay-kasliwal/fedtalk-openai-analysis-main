0,U.S. Government Bond Yields Slip Ahead of Fed Decision,2021-06-16T16:41:00Z,"U.S. government bond yields edged lower, with investors awaiting details from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.","U.S. government bond yields edged lower Wednesday, with investors awaiting details from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note recently traded at 1.490%, according to Tradeweb, down from 1.498% at Thursday’s close. The 30-year bond yield traded at 2.182%, down from 2.199%.
Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, slipped before the 2 p.m. release of details from the central bank’s meeting. Analysts and investors generally expect the Fed to hold short-term interest rates near zero and keep buying at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds, policies implemented over a year ago to help ease trading conditions and fuel the U.S. economic recovery after last year’s market turmoil.
Chairman Jerome Powell has reiterated his belief that the U.S. economy hasn’t recovered sufficiently for the central bank to tighten monetary policy. Investors are watching the meeting for new forecasts, which could show officials expect to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated in March. Some analysts believe that officials may begin discussing when and how to scale back the pace of bond purchases.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq drifted just below record highs on Wednesday, with investors on edge before potential hints from the Federal Reserve on when it would taper its massive monetary stimulus. The Fed has previously tried to assuage concerns that rising inflation would prompt it to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy, but data on Tuesday showing a jump in producer prices has again raised expectations the central bank could begin debating closing the taps at its meeting this week. Inflation concerns have dominated markets in recent weeks even as strong corporate earnings and the gradual reopening of the US economy have helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reach all-time highs. ""All eyes are really on consideration of tapering,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ""My guess is it's likely not today's business and more in line with August's Kansas City, Jackson Hole summit where they might introduce the concept of timing around tapering but you never know."" The central bank's latest policy statement is expected to be released with fresh economic projections. Interest rate-sensitive bank stocks shed about 1.9 per cent, tracking a dip in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield . On the other hand, technology, utilities and healthcare were in a bright spot. Just before 10am, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44.55 points, or 0.13 per cent, at 34,254.78 and the S&P 500 was down 0.74 points, or 0.02 per cent, at 4,245.85.

4,BSP stays calm on expected US Fed rate hike,2021-06-16T16:00:00Z,Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said Thursday the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve will not have any significant impact on the Philippines because of the countrys solid and strong macroeconomic fundamentals.,"Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said Thursday the possibility of an early interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve will not have any significant impact on the Philippines because of the country’s solid and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. “Any rate hike by the Fed will not be an immediate threat to the Philippines. Our GIR [gross international reserves] is healthy and interest rates now are at rock bottom,” Diokno said in an online news briefing. “There will be a mid-term election in the US next year. I doubt the Fed chairman will ‘rock the boat’ amid the [ongoing] uncertainties during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Diokno said. Diokno assured that local monetary authorities would be ready if the Fed decides to increase interest rates sooner. “We could do a lot of measures [on this],” he said. Reports from the US indicated the Federal Reserve signaled an increase in interest rates earlier than previously expected amid the accelerating economic growth and inflation. After a two-day meeting, Fed officials left the main interest rate near zero and said the agency would continue to make massive purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds to support financial conditions and the recovery. More Fed officials now see a rate hike happening next year or in 2023. Most Fed officials in March expected no rate change through 2023. The Monetary Board of the BSP on May 12 kept the record-low benchmark interest rate at 2 percent, on expectation that inflation rate would remain manageable in the coming months. Diokno said Thursday the accommodative monetary policy and liquidity-enhancing measures of the BSP continued to support the domestic economy amid the health crisis by fostering favorable credit conditions and the orderly functioning of the government securities market.“With a manageable inflation outlook, the BSP continues to prioritize the use of monetary policy space to provide support to economic activity amid the pandemic as key sectors transition to the post-pandemic phase,” he said. The BSP’s liquidity-easing measures released up to P2.2 trillion or equivalent to 12.1 percent of gross domestic product into the financial system. These measures included the 200-basis point cumulative reduction in policy rate in 2020, the reductions in reserve requirement ratios, purchases of government securities in the secondary market and provisional advances to the national government. Diokno said with ample liquidity in the financial system, domestic interest rates gradually declined over the past several months, even as lending activity remained affected by banks’ risk aversion due to concerns over asset quality, profitability and the broader economic outlook. “The prevailing stance of monetary policy remains anchored on the BSP’s assessment of a manageable outlook for inflation over the next two years,” he said. “This outlook in turn is based on the continued predominant role of transitory supply-side factors in the inflation uptick in recent months. In addition, the extent of unused economic capacity amid the early stages of demand recovery partly mitigates the risk of near-term demand-driven pressures as well as second round-effects from supply-side inflation pressures,” he said. Diokno said with asset prices keeping in line with overall market fundamentals, the BSP remained on the lookout for signs of imbalances amid a low-interest rate environment and in anticipation of further demand recovery. “Looking ahead, the BSP shall remain vigilant to ensure that policy responses will neither lead to excessive inflation nor trigger financial stability risks, especially as economic recovery gets underway,” he said.",https://manilastandard.net/business/banking-report/357395/bsp-stays-calm-on-expected-us-fed-rate-hike.html

The European Union raised 20 billion euros ($24 billion) from a 10-year bond on Tuesday in the largest-ever single-tranche institutional debt sale that saw near-record demand of 142 billion euros, taking a big step towards establishing itself as a major debt issuer..
The bond rallied sharply in the secondary market in further evidence of strong demand, with its yield - 0.086% at pricing - down 5 basis points to around 0.04% on Wednesday.
The rally was similar to that following the EU’s first issuance last October backing the SURE unemployment scheme, a smaller support programme.
With demand far above the deal size, much investor appetite was left unsatisfied, bankers involved with the deal said.
“Given the particularly low (investor) allocations compared to normal, you’re going to get more follow-on demand than you would typically see,” one of the bankers said.
It attracted such large demand at issuance even though the EU capped orders it considered from hedge funds, which, inflating their demand to secure better allocations, have been a major driver of large bond sale order books.
Investors were keen to buy the first issuance of what will become a much more liquid funding programme than SURE, the bankers said.
The European Central Bank upholding accelerated bond purchases for the third quarter has also given investors confidence to buy into sizable debt sales.
In the broader market, bond yields dipped as the focus was on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
The benchmark 10-year yield was last half a basis point at 1.4939% while investors waited for signs that the policies put into place last year to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, including a massive bond-buying programme, may be altered.
Fed officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks on tapering its bond purchases, while attention will also be on new interest rate and economic projections to show how much policymakers’ views have changed since March.
Germany’s 10-year yield, the euro area benchmark, was down slightly over one basis point to -0.243%, along with most other 10-year yields.
In recent weeks, bond yields, which have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic - closely correlated - have shrugged off a spike in U.S. inflation.
“U.S. yields will probably be the main driver of direction of European yields over the coming three months and I think the Fed rhetoric on tapering and where their inflation targets are will be of interest,” said Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.
In the primary market, Germany raised 4.085 billion euros from the auction of a new 10-year bond.

Although the Fed is expected to keep interest rates pinned at near-zero, the central bank may offer some clues on when it will slow its aggressive asset purchase program.
Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has been snatching up $120 billion a month in U.S Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities.
With inflationary pressures rising and the economy on the path to recovery, some Fed officials said they were eager to have discussions on paring back the pace of the so-called quantitative easing program.
But the Fed remains concerned about the recovery in the labor market, as May jobs data showed the economy is still 7.6 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels.
The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will release a statement at 2 p.m. ET, alongside a set of economic projections mapping out forecasts for economic indicators like inflation and unemployment.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will then be pressed on the central bank's policy stance at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

Previously expected in March, four of the 18 Federal Open Market Committee members were looking for a rate hike at some point in 2022. At the same time, seven members saw a rate increase in 2023.
Every quarter, members of the FOMC forecast where interest rates will go in the short, medium and long term. These projections are represented visually in charts below called a dot plot.
Here are the Fed's latest targets, released in Wednesday's statement:
This is what the Fed's forecast looked like in March 2021:
The Federal Reserve also slightly dialed up its economic expectations for 2021, according to the central bank's Summary of Economic Projections released Wednesday.
The central bank now expects real gross domestic product to grow 7.0% in 2021, compared with its 6.5% forecast from its March meeting. The Fed also upped its 2023 real GDP forecast to 2.4% from 2.2% expected previously.

The Fed also sharply increased its inflation forecasts for the year. The central bank now sees inflation running to 3.4% this year, above its previous estimate of 2.4%. The Fed also slightly hiked its PCE inflation estimates for 2022 and 2023.
Core PCE inflation is expected to come in at 3.0% in 2021, up from March's forecast of 2.2%. Core PCE for 2022 is now expected at 2.1%.
The Fed still estimates the unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% in 2021. The FOMC expects the unemployment rate to drop to 3.8% and 3.5% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

The central bank's latest policy statement is set to be released at 2 p.m. ET, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m.
While the Fed is not expected to make any policy changes or rate hikes at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, markets were on edge Wednesday morning. The Fed's ""cheap money"" strategy has been widely viewed as the catalyst for Wall Street's series of record highs over the past year.
The Fed's benchmark lending rate currently stands at between 0 percent and 0.25 percent, and is expected to remain at that range until at least the end of 2024, according to the Fed's March economic projections.
In remarks before Congress and in other economic forums, Powell has reiterated his commitment to the Fed's accommodative policy stance, emphasizing that the central bank is open to seeing inflation run slightly above its 2 percent target for a period of time — as long as that inflation remains ""transitory.""
However, with inflation running hotter than expected, and the economy growing more quickly than anticipated, an increasing number of economists and market participants are questioning that policy.
Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in a note that he expects Fed officials to signal a rate increase as early as 2023.
“We are also bringing forward our expectations for liftoff to late 2023,” he said.
The Fed has so far doubled down on its outlook and is determined to ""keep the pump primed until employment is all the way back to pre-pandemic levels,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.
The current labor market shortage has forced some companies to raise wages, triggering price increases in some cases. While the Fed could raise the interest rate in order to rein in that inflation, that would have a negative impact on the labor market, as companies tighten their hiring to keep costs down. The latest monthly jobs report shows an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent — higher than pre-pandemic levels, which were hovering at a half-century low of around 3.5 percent.
""Employment is worse than the headline numbers suggest,"" McMillan said. ""Job growth continues, but millions of people are still out of work, despite the labor shortage headlines. Since the Fed has a dual mandate — unemployment and inflation — that suggests it should indeed keep its focus on unemployment, rather than inflation. And that means continuing to provide monetary stimulus to help the real economy.""
Powell, whose four-year tenure as chair ends in February, has repeatedly clarified that he would give plenty of notice before the central bank starts to withdraw its crisis-era support — ostensibly to prevent any “taper tantrum,” when markets were thrown into turmoil in 2013 after the Fed said it intended to scale back its bond purchasing.
“I think this is going to be Powell's toughest conference in his career as chairman,” Dan North, senior economist at Euler Hermes North America, told NBC News. Announcing a timetable for dialing back bond buying would likely spook markets — but not addressing inflation at all could also jangle nerves on Wall Street. “He's in a pretty difficult position either way,” North said.
The Fed's annual symposium in August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is widely expected to be the moment when Fed officials begin to discuss in earnest the timeline for winding down its $120 billion monthly bond buying.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/key-meeting-federal-reserve-could-signal-rate-hike-sooner-expected-n1270980

Stocks have surged to record highs as bullish investors monitor the economic recovery from the pandemic alongside unprecedented government and central bank stimulus. Volatility across asset classes has been pushed to levels last seen before COVID-19 roiled markets in March 2020.
But recent data shows inflation rising in the United States and elsewhere, keeping investors sidelined with a new Fed statement imminent.
Data on Wednesday showed UK inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England’s 2.0% target in May and hit 2.1%, following U.S. data showing prices rose more than expected.
That heightens the attention on Wednesday’s readout from the Fed and subsequent press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed is not expected to discuss an exit from its bond purchases until later this summer, but officials could at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit.
With markets having priced in the start of those talks about tapering but unsure whether rising inflation will encourage more aggressive action from the Fed and other central banks, some caution has crept in.
“Things have shifted since the last FOMC meeting. Back in April, the Fed noted that the pace of economic recovery and employment had strengthened,” wrote Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. “Since the April meeting, we have gotten two months of disappointing jobs data and two months of higher than expected inflation readings.”
Key will be Fed members’ projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only seven out of 18 had seen such a move.

The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was 0.014% lower at 90.52. The index hit a one-month high on Tuesday after data pointed to higher inflation. ""The USD remains narrowly mixed to slightly softer ahead of the Fed meeting, with the major currencies essentially holding in established ranges,"" Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank, said in a note.
Market participants will be listening to the news conference after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting for any change in tone from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about whether inflation is likely to be temporary or longer-lasting. ""We see no major changes in the policy outlook, with disappointing jobs data precluding the Fed from declaring that it is making substantial progress towards its objectives and paving the way for a tapering in asset purchases,"" Osborne said.
""Tweaks to the statement and projections will have to recognize higher inflation,"" Osborne said. While there may be some ""talk about talking about tapering"" and some further shift in expectations of rate hikes in 2023, Osborne said he does not expect the market to be greatly surprised.
Risk-sensitive currencies were slightly higher, with the New Zealand dollar up 0.38% at $0.7146 and the Australian dollar - which is seen as a proxy for risk appetite - up 0.3% at $0.7708. Sterling strengthened against the dollar on Wednesday after data showed British inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's 2% target in May, sparking some concerns that policymakers may start signaling a shift in policy thinking if prices shoot up further.
Meanwhile, bitcoin's recent rally appeared to run out of steam, as the world's largest cryptocurrency fell 2.72% to $39,078.38.

Stocks look set for a mixed open as investors await the Federal Reserve’s announcement in the afternoon.
Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 21 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq Composite futures advanced 0.1%.
Investors are in wait-and-see mode, as the Fed will reveal the direction of monetary policy. Among the most pressing questions: When will the central bank reduce the current bond purchasing program, which would likely lower bond prices, lift their yields, and be a negative for stock valuations. “Stock futures are flat this morning as a sense of Fed paralysis grips global markets ahead of the FOMC announcement,” writes Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research.
Essaye added that if the Fed officially states that it will begin its tapering program, stocks could perform poorly. But if the Fed merely admits it is considering tapering, stocks may not fall.
Here are five stocks making moves in Wednesday’s premarket action:
Dish Network (DISH) has gained 2.1% after getting upgraded to Buy from Hold at Pivotal Research.
U.S. Steel (X) has dropped 1.1% after getting assumed with Underweight from Neutral at JPMorgan.
General Motors (GM) has risen 2.1% after it said it would increase spending on electric by 30% by 2025.
Oracle (ORCL) has dropped 5.2% after beating earnings forecasts but offering disappointing guidance.
Meme stocks were trading lower. AMC Entertainment Holdings (ticker: AMC) stock fell 4.1%, while GameStop (GME) stock declined 3.7%.

With U.S. inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic. Graphic: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook:
Balanced against the improving economic terrain: The United States is still 7.5 million jobs short of where it was in early 2020, and the reopening of schools, concert venues and a host of other public areas remains a work in progress.
Daily coronavirus infections and deaths have plummeted, but only about half of those over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated, short of what epidemiologists feel is needed to squelch the virus for good and eliminate the risk of future localized outbreaks.
Any actual change in monetary policy is, as a result, likely months down the road as the Fed balances a variety of risks.
The central bank’s latest policy statement, due to be released with fresh economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), is expected to err on the side of continuing the Fed’s support for the economy until more workers are back on the job. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference to elaborate on the two-day meeting.
Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates.
""This is about getting the ball rolling,"" in a process that may take months to complete, and in a way that avoids any rapid shift in sentiment among investors or consumers that could damage the recovery in the meantime, wrote Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors and a University of Oregon professor focused on Fed policy. Graphic: Substantial further progress for the Fed? :
LIFTOFF
The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers’ views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024.
U.S. job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving “transitory,” and hiring to accelerate as the nation’s economic reopening continues.
The Fed has laid out an explicit test for any rate hike - including the need for inflation to not just reach but exceed the central bank’s 2% target “for some time” in order to make up for years of inflation that was too low. The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed’s preferred inflation measure to 3.6%. While that was the highest in 13 years, it was only one monthly reading and driven by factors officials feel will fade over time.
Still, the timing for the initial “liftoff” of rates could shift into 2023 if only two or three officials feel the improved outlook, or a too-fast-return of inflation, would warrant faster action - a change investors may read as particularly “hawkish.”
Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. economist, Matthew Luzzetti, wrote last week that he felt it a “close call” whether the Fed’s updated “dot plot” of interest rate projections would advance an initial rate hike into next year, but that ultimately the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would see continued near-zero rates as more consistent with the path of the recovery and the management of the twin inflation and employment goals.
“With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed’s transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed’s views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,” Luzzetti said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/wrapup-2-fed-expected-to-flag-start-of-monetary-policy-shift-debate-idUSL2N2NX1EJ

Investor bullishness about the economic recovery after COVID-19 and ample stimulus from central banks and governments has propelled stocks to record highs. Volatility across asset classes has been pushed to levels last seen before the pandemic roiled markets in March 2020.
But inflation is also rising in the United States and elsewhere. Data on Wednesday showed UK inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's 2.0% target in May and hit 2.1%, and inflation looks set to rise further as Britain reopens its economy. That makes the tone and content of Wednesday's readout from the Fed's meeting more important for global markets. Officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit the policies introduced during the pandemic last year.

U.S. stock futures were flat ahead of Wednesday afternoon's conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting. No policy changes are expected, but Wall Street wants to know whether the Fed still thinks rising inflation is transitory and whether its latest view will lead to a sooner-than-expected rate hike and a tapering of its massive bond buying program. On Day 1 of the Fed meeting and after another red-hot inflation report, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke three-day winning streaks, dipping from record closes on Monday. The Dow fell Tuesday for its second straight day. The 30-stock average was roughly 1.4% away from its record high close in early May.

Housing starts and building permits for May, the final piece of major economic data before the Fed's decision, is set to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect a 3.9% increase in new construction to an annual rate of 1.63 million units. Housing starts tumbled 9.5% in April. Building permits are seen falling 1.7% to 1.73 million in May following a 0.3% gain in April. In addition to its policy statement, the Fed also issues its quarterly summary of economic projections. According to CNBC's latest Fed survey, economists, fund managers and Wall Street strategists don't see tapering before January or the first rate hike from near-zero levels until November 2022.

In one of the most highly anticipated geopolitical events of the year, the meeting of U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin got underway Wednesday in Geneva. The summit comes as relations between the two nations have deteriorated, with the U.S. accusing Russia of election meddling as well as involvement in human rights abuses and recent cyberattacks. Russia has always denied the multiple accusations leveled against it, saying it's a victim of anti-Russian sentiment in the West. Biden meets with Putin after a flurry of American diplomacy with Europe allies at the G-7 and NATO summits.

An antibody combination made by U.S biotech Regeneron reduces the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients with severe Covid whose own immune systems failed to mount a response, according to a University of Oxford study. Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Wednesday, ""This was the subset that the [former] president also probably fell into,"" referring to when Donald Trump received the Regeneron treatment during his bout with Covid last year. Previous studies of the Regeneron cocktail in nonhospitalized Covid patients have shown that the treatment reduces viral load, shortens the time to the resolution of symptoms, and significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization or death.

The European Union raised 20 billion euros ($24 billion) from a 10-year bond on Tuesday in the largest-ever single-tranche institutional debt sale that saw near-record demand of 142 billion euros, taking a big step towards establishing itself as a major debt issuer..
The bond rallied sharply in the secondary market in further evidence of strong demand, with its yield - 0.086% at pricing - down 5 basis points to around 0.04% on Wednesday.
The rally was similar to that following the EU’s first issuance last October backing the SURE unemployment scheme, a smaller support programme.
With demand far above the deal size, much investor appetite was left unsatisfied, bankers involved with the deal said.
“Given the particularly low (investor) allocations compared to normal, you’re going to get more follow-on demand than you would typically see,” one of the bankers said.
It attracted such large demand at issuance even though the EU capped orders it considered from hedge funds, which, inflating their demand to secure better allocations, have been a major driver of large bond sale order books.
Investors were keen to buy the first issuance of what will become a much more liquid funding programme than SURE, the bankers said.
The European Central Bank upholding accelerated bond purchases for the third quarter has also given investors confidence to buy into sizable debt sales.
In the broader market, bond yields dipped as the focus was on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
Germany’s 10-year yield, the euro area benchmark, was down one basis point to -0.24%, along with most other 10-year yields.
Fed officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks on tapering its bond purchases, while attention will also be on new interest rate and economic projections to show how much policymakers’ views have changed since March.
In recent weeks, bond yields, which have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic - closely correlated - have shrugged off a spike in U.S. inflation.
“U.S. yields will probably be the main driver of direction of European yields over the coming three months and I think the Fed rhetoric on tapering and where their inflation targets are will be of interest,” said Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.
In the primary market, Germany raised 4.085 billion euros from the auction of a new 10-year bond.

(Reuters) - S&P and Nasdaq futures hovered just below record highs on Wednesday with investors on edge before potential comments from the Federal Reserve on when it would taper its massive monetary stimulus.
The Fed has previously tried to assuage concerns that rising inflation would prompt it to tighten its ultra loose monetary policy, but data on Tuesday showing a jump in producer prices has again raised expectations the central bank could begin debating closing the taps at its meeting this week.

Contracts on the S&P 500 edged slightly lower. A day earlier, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed out the session lower, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pulling back from record highs logged earlier this week. Treasury yields were mostly lower, and the benchmark 10-year yield hovered around 1.49%.
Traders are anxiously awaiting the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, which will culminate with a policy statement Wednesday afternoon and a press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Both come at a critical juncture in the U.S. economic recovery, with economic activity accelerating and producing inflationary pressures that some market participants believe may warrant a nearer-term shift to monetary policy than the central bank has currently telegraphed.
On Tuesday, new economic data showed producer prices surged at the fastest year-on-year rate on record, with inflationary pressures reverberating across the supply chain as demand picks up. The data added to a spate of other readings corroborating these rising prices, with both the core consumer price index and core personal consumption expenditures at a near 30-year high in May.
""I do think this impulse of inflation, although transitory, is going to be much higher than the Fed and market participants are expecting right now. I'm expecting some more hotter inflation data, but ultimately those pressures ease as we get into 2022."" Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, told Yahoo Finance. He added he expects the Fed to begin laying out a path toward tapering its asset purchase program as soon as August or September, but that actual tapering will likely not ultimately begin until next year.
For now, the Federal Reserve has continued its quantitative easing with asset purchases taking place at a rate of $120 billion per month and kept interest rates near zero, and has maintained that it believes inflation pressures will prove transitory. Wednesday's meeting will also come with an updated Summary of Economic Projections, or dot plot, from the Fed, which may should changes to their median projections for economic growth and the timing for a rate hike. The Fed's latest dot plot signaled it would keep rates on hold near zero through at least 2023.
Story continues
""The reopening of the economy has continued as COVID cases have dropped, and all the near-real-time indicators of economic activity have improved markedly,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Tuesday. ""Unemployment, however, remains elevated, despite some 3.5 million people still absent from the labor force, compared to the pre-COVID level.""
""The Fed, in short, is not yet in a position to declare that 'substantial further progress' — the test for beginning to taper its asset purchases — has been made,"" he added. ""The question for markets and Chair Powell [Wednesday], though, is whether sufficient progress-towards-progress has been made to allow the Fed to start talking about tapering.""

Investors this week are watching for any changes in Fed policy makers’ views on inflation, the labor market, and other economic indicators that may offer hints on when they would begin tapering bond purchases. Data Tuesday showed that retail sales dropped in May while producer prices rose, offering a mixed picture of the recovery.
“We’ve had the initial exuberance and we are catching up a little bit to reality. Markets are less liquid—being summertime—and they are also digesting some of this anticipation,” said Shaniel Ramjee, a multiasset fund manager at Pictet Asset Management. “There have been some data points that have come in lower than expected, such as retail sales. It has reduced the cause for concern that the Fed could taper faster than expected.”
The Fed will release its latest monetary policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank will also release individual policy makers’ updated quarterly economic projections. The new forecasts could show officials expecting to raise interest rates sooner than they anticipated in March. They are also likely to begin discussing when and how to start scaling back bond purchases.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-06-16-2021-11623829277

23,Here is where inflation stands as the Fed meets.,2021-06-16T09:57:53Z,A jump in consumer prices is sure to come up at a news conference on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve’s meeting.,"Here is where inflation stands as the Fed meets. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, is expected to continue predicting that inflation pressures will fade when he holds a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The Federal Reserve will release its June policy decision and newest economic projections at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, and investors will be scrutinizing its announcements for clues on whether the central bank’s thinking about inflation might be changing. Price gains have been coming in quicker than central bankers had expected when they last released economic projections in March, and that has invited questions about whether and when the Fed will need to begin removing its economic policy supports, which remain set to emergency mode. Any tweaks to the Fed’s policy statement or estimates about the outlook will be closely watched. Economists generally expect Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to stick to the script when it comes to price increases: Predicting that inflation pressures will fade as the United States gets through a funky reopening period and noting that the central bank has the tools to deal with inflation if gains do last. There are reasons to expect the bump to wane. Prices sank during lockdowns last year, making the year-over-year comparison look artificially big, and prices are rising now because demand is bouncing back faster than supply. Officials expect that the bottlenecks restricting the supply of items like cars and airline tickets will clear up as things return to normal. But as climbing costs for consumers dominate headlines and political debates in Washington, Mr. Powell is likely to face questions about how much inflation the Fed is willing to tolerate before the situation is no longer seen as manageable and temporary. Here are the inflation indicators the Fed is working with headed into its meeting: Personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred gauge: up 3.6 percent in April from the prior year, the fastest pace in 13 years.
Core P.C.E., which strips out volatile food and energy prices: up 3.1 percent in April over the year, the fastest pace since 1992.
Consumer Price Index, an important Labor Department gauge: up 5 percent in May from a year earlier.
University of Michigan consumer inflation expectation for next year: moderated to 4 percent in preliminary June data, but still up from 3 percent at the start of the year.
University of Michigan consumer inflation expectation for five years from now: moderated to 2.8 percent in preliminary June data, little changed from 2.7 percent at the start of 2021.
Five-year, five-year forward inflation expectation rate, a market-based measure: appears to have stabilized around 2.3 percent after climbing sharply earlier this year.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, inflation expectation for next year: 4 percent, up from 3 percent at the start of the year.
New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, inflation expectation for three years from now: 3.6 percent, up from 3 percent at the start of the year. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation on average, and officials had been hoping to coax inflation slightly higher so that price gains average their goal rate after years of weakness. Officials have also aspired to lift inflation expectations, which had been drifting too low. As a result, the recent moves higher might be received as good news. The key question is how long stronger price pressures will last — and at what point they will have overstayed their welcome. Read more
TikTok takes over the top sponsor spot at VidCon, edging out YouTube. VidCon attracts young influencers the way Davos attracts older ones. Credit... Jerod Harris/Getty Images VidCon, the annual online video convention that has become the biggest event in the influencer industry, is returning to the Anaheim Convention Center in California this fall. And it has a new top sponsor: TikTok. The announcement on Tuesday, which was first reported by Variety, solidified the app’s ascendancy after a year of tremendous growth and reflected a changed social media landscape, one where overnight stardom is more likely to happen on TikTok than on YouTube, which had been VidCon’s top sponsor since 2013. TikTok, which was introduced in the United States in 2018, made a memorable appearance at the last VidCon, in 2019. Its splashy party drew such a crowd that hundreds of creators were left standing at the entrance. This year, the company’s presence will only be bigger. TikTok will bring many of the app’s top creators to appear at events, and an executive at the company will deliver the keynote address. Since its founding in 2010, VidCon has been an opportunity for creators to network with executives in entertainment and technology; source brand deals; socialize; and meet fans. Last year’s VidCon drew more than 75,000 attendees. In years past, YouTubers dominated the convention, but the creator economy has changed dramatically in the last year. A spokesperson from YouTube said that the company will maintain a large presence at this year’s event, which is scheduled to take place Oct. 21-24. “We prioritized the health and safety of our creators, fans and employees as we thoughtfully worked through our VidCon plans months ago,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “We are excited to continue our investment in our creators and VidCon as we have done since 2013 through new and different opportunities as part of the overall program.” Read more

In an about-face, Lordstown Motors says it has enough money and will start building trucks. Credit... Megan Jelinger/Agence France-Presse—Getty Images A day after ousting two top executives, the electric truck start-up Lordstown Motors said on Tuesday that it was on track to start production in September even if it does not raise additional funding, contradicting what it told securities regulators just a week ago. In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Lordstown said it needed to raise more money and might not survive. Then, on Monday its founder and chief executive, Steve Burns, and the company’s chief financial officer resigned. But in a news conference hosted by the Detroit-based Automotive Press Association, the company’s new executive team presented a far more optimistic outlook without providing many details. Lordstown’s president, Rich Schmidt, said that the company would start making trucks at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in late September and that it had enough money to last until May 2022. He said the company would be able to make about 15,000 trucks over the next 24 months. He also said the company was still actively seeking new funding to increase production. “It’s a new day at Lordstown Motors, and there is no and will be no disruption to our plans to start production,” the company’s new executive chairwoman, Angela Strand, said. She had previously served as the lead independent director on Lordstown’s board. Lordstown’s stock had climbed to nearly $31 a share earlier this year, but fell to about $7 in May, after Mr. Burns acknowledged that the thousands of “pre-orders” the company had been touting were not binding orders. Some large orders the company had announced had also come from “influencers” who did not plan to buy the trucks themselves, the company said on Monday. Mr. Schmidt, who joined Lordstown in 2019 after a stint at Tesla, said on Tuesday that the company had “binding” orders for all the trucks the company is likely to make in 2021 and 2022. But he declined to disclose the total number, name specific customers or say whether they had paid deposits to secure their orders. “Those are firm orders,” Mr. Schmidt said. “They have been reconfirmed last week.” Lordstown shares jumped more than 10 percent on Tuesday. He said production would start in September even though the company’s Endurance truck has not passed all the required crash and engineering tests needed to be cleared for sale in the United States. Trucks that roll off its assembly line would be held until the testing is complete and then modified, if necessary, before being shipped to customers, a highly unusual practice in the auto industry. Mr. Schmidt offered little detail on what prompted Mr. Burns’s departure. About a dozen other senior executives were also let go on Monday. Lordstown gained attention in 2019 when it agreed to buy a plant that General Motors was closing. The shutdown drew scorn from President Donald J. Trump, and G.M. sold the plant to Lordstown for just $20 million. Mr. Trump later hosted Mr. Burns at the White House. Lordstown plans to make a rugged, electric pickup truck for commercial customers like mining and construction businesses. Mr. Burns had hoped the company would become the Tesla of the pickup market. But investors grew concerned about Lordstown’s prospects after a small investment firm, Hindenburg Research, published a report in March that raised questions about interest in the company’s trucks.

24,PRECIOUS-Gold holds steady as market awaits Fed view on stimulus,2021-06-16T09:34:22Z,"* Federal Reserve policy statement due at 1800 GMT (Recasts, adds comment, updates prices)","* U.S. retail sales drop 1.3% in May
* Federal Reserve policy statement due at 1800 GMT (Recasts, adds comment, updates prices)
June 16 (Reuters) - Gold prices steadied in a narrow range on Wednesday as investors awaited for any signs of early tapering from the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
Spot gold was steady at $1,859.00 per ounce by 0902 GMT. It fell to its lowest since May 17 at $1,843.99 on Monday.
U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,860.90.
In a new policy statement and economic projections due on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to acknowledge the first conversations among its policymakers about when and how fast to pare back its massive bond-buying programme launched in 2020.
UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said the market was looking for any hawkish signals so they would be more likely to move gold prices than the Fed reiterating that it would stick with the dovish path of recent months.
“There is inflation pressure building up, so the question is how they perceive that,” Staunovo said.
Potentially buoying gold’s appeal for investors holding other currencies, the dollar index edged down slightly.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May, while producer prices jumped by 6.6% year-on-year during the month, the largest gain since November 2010.
This comes on the backdrop of recent data showing a spike in U.S. consumer prices, which have raised concerns over rising inflation rates.
However, Fed officials have said rising inflationary pressures are transitory and ultra-easy monetary settings would stay in place for some time.
“The street is heavily positioned with the Fed in the transitory indication corner. The FOMC is unlikely to rock the boat tonight, and if they did, it would be a massive surprise,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA said, referring to the Fed’s policy committee.

25,Global Stocks Mostly Pause as Fed Decision Looms,2021-06-16T08:56:00Z,"Equities traded softer in Asia, while European stocks and U.S. futures were flat, with all eyes on the outcome of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.","Text size
Stocks traded mixed across the globe on Wednesday, with U.S. equity futures largely flat as investors awaited the outcome of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
The Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.5%, while China’s CSI 300 index lost 1.7%, with modest losses also sprinkled across the region. Fresh data out of China showed signs of the country’s strong rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic starting to moderate, with industrial production and retail sales rising, but at a slower pace, along with fixed-asset investment.
The European Stoxx 600 and U.S. stock futures were flat, though Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were tilting lower.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite backed away from records to close lower on Tuesday, with the Dow industrials also dropping. Stocks slipped following data that showed a bigger-than-expected 1.3% drop in retail sales for May, while the producer-price index excluding food and energy rose 0.7%, against expectations for an increase of 0.5%.
The data provide a fresh economic backdrop for the Federal Reserve decision, which investors will be watching closely for any sign the central bank is nearing a reduction in the size of its bond-purchasing program. Such a signal could send bond prices lower and yields higher, which tends to be a negative for stock valuations.
“Given the recent elevated inflation readings and the middling jobs reports, this is among the most consequential Fed meetings in some time as the committee balances these aspects of the dual mandate,” said Scott Ruesterholz, portfolio manager at Insight Investment, which has $1.03 trillion in assets under management.
“There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty: how much of the inflation is being driven by transitory factors, like supply chain disruptions, and how much of the slower job growth is being driven by temporary measures like enhanced unemployment benefits,” he said in emailed comments.
But like others, Ruesterholz expects the Fed to “strike a patient tone, wanting to ensure they do not overreact and slow the pace of recovery.”
More data are ahead for Wednesday—building permits and housing starts and import prices for May.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged at 1.4931%, while the U.S. dollar was also steady. Copper prices slipped, after China said it plans to release national metal reserves in a bid to cool a surge in commodities prices. That also hit shares of mining stocks in Europe, with Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Glencore weakening.
Oil prices hovered at two-year highs, with West Texas Intermediate crude up 0.7% to $72.64 and Brent crude rising nearly 0.8% to $74.55 a barrel. Investors are waiting on a weekly U.S. report from the Energy Information Administration that is expected to show a fourth straight weekly fall in domestic crude inventories.
Shares of Oracle could be active after the enterprise software company late on Tuesday reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results, but softer-than-anticipated guidance for the August quarter. The stock has also rallied nearly 30% since mid-March, so investors may be compelled to take profits.

Investor bullishness about the economic recovery after COVID-19 and ample stimulus from central banks and governments has propelled stocks to record highs and pushed volatility across asset classes to levels last seen before the pandemic roiled markets in March 2020.
But inflation is also rising in the United States and elsewhere. Data on Wednesday showed UK inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England’s 2.0% target in May and hit 2.1%, and inflation looks set to rise further as Britain reopens its economy.
That makes the tone and content of Wednesday’s readout from the Fed’s meeting more important for global markets. Officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit the policies introduced during the pandemic last year.
With markets having priced in the start of those talks about tapering but unsure whether rising inflation will encourage more aggressive action from the Fed and other central banks, some caution has crept in.
On Wednesday, the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day.
The Euro STOXX 600 was little changed. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.24% and Germany’s DAX shed 0.1%.
Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher, and Asian shares were weaker.
“The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting is highly unlikely to bring any changes to either rates or the pace of asset purchases,” UniCredit analysts said.
“However, we expect the Fed to signal that, if the economy continues to recover strongly, it will likely be appropriate to begin to discuss a plan for tapering the pace of asset purchases at some point in upcoming meetings.”
Key will be Fed members’ projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only seven out of 18 had seen such a move.

There could also be some upward movement in inflation projections for this year and next, as the last two readings on consumer prices surprised to the high side.
BofA’s latest survey of fund managers suggests most are sanguine on the outlook. Some 72% said inflation was transitory. Only 23% saw it as permanent.

The European Union raised 20 billion euros ($24.26 billion) from a 10-year bond sale on Tuesday in the largest-ever single-tranche institutional debt sale that saw near-record demand of 142 billion euros.
That kicks off up to 800 billion euros of bond issuance until end-2026 to finance the recovery fund that will establish the EU as a leading issuer.
The bond rallied sharply in the secondary market in further evidence of strong demand, demonstrating that the market easily absorbed the vast issuance.
The yield, 0.086% at pricing, fell nearly 6 basis points to 0.035% on Wednesday.
The rally was similar to that following the EU’s first debt issuance backing the SURE unemployment scheme, a smaller support programme.
“Even we’re a little surprised that it’s managed to perform that well that quickly, given the size,” a banker involved with the bond sale said.
Investors were keen to buy the first issuance of what will become a much more liquid funding programme than SURE, while a recent cheapening of EU debt also helped to attract investors, the banker said.
The ECB’s decision to uphold accelerated bond purchases for the third quarter has also given investors confidence to buy into sizable debt sales.
In the broader market, bond yields dipped as the focus was on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
Germany’s 10-year yield, the euro area benchmark, was down nearly a basis point to -0.24%, along with most other 10-year yields.
Fed officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks on tapering its bond purchases, while attention will also be on new interest rate and economic projections to show how much policymakers’ views have changed since March.
In recent weeks, bond yields, which have fallen on both sides of the Atlantic - closely correlated - have shrugged off a spike in U.S. inflation.
“U.S. yields will probably be the main driver of direction of European yields over the coming three months and I think the Fed rhetoric on tapering and where their inflation targets are will be of interest,” said Nick Sanders, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.
In the primary market, Germany will raise 5 billion euros from the auction of a new 10-year bond.

At the close of trade, the Shanghai Composite index was down 1.07% at 3,518.33 and the blue-chip CSI300 index lost 1.67%, having finished weaker on Tuesday.
Analysts said there was a lack of factors for any upside momentum, while lofty valuations in some parts of the market were a cause of concern.
The market was also under pressure from rising Sino-West tensions after G7 leaders took the Asian nation to task over a range of issues, which Beijing called a gross interference in the country’s internal affairs.
Among the worst-performing sectors on Wednesday, the material sub-index slumped 3.08% as a report on restrictions over state-owned firms’ overseas commodity exposure accelerated a sell-off in the sector.
The healthcare sub-index lost 3.01%, with sector heavyweight Wuxi AppTec Co Ltd sliding 5.53%.

China’s central bank has directed financial institutions to hold more foreign exchange in reserve, a move that analysts say could help temper a rally in the yuan after the currency hit a three-year high against the dollar on Monday.
Long-term appreciation in the yuan could have a large negative impact on China’s economy even if there was no substantial effect on the country’s exports in the short term, a former senior official at China’s foreign exchange regulator warned.

The Federal Open Market Committee is set to wrap up its two-day monetary policy meeting at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon, with the release of its usual statement and quarterly economic projections. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is then due to hold a press briefing at 2:30 p.m. ET.
The Fed is not expected to take any action in this meeting but economists expect the central bank to signal that it is starting to think about tapering bond purchases.
The Fed will also release new forecasts on Wednesday, which could indicate a possible first rate hike penciled in for 2023. Previously, Fed officials hadn't come to a consensus for a rate hike through 2023.
Scott Ruesterholz, portfolio manager at Insight Investment, said on Tuesday that this was among the ""most consequential Fed meetings in some time as the committee balances these aspects of the dual mandate.""
""There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty: how much of the inflation is being driven by transitory factors, like supply chain disruptions, and how much of the slower job growth is being driven by temporary measures like enhanced unemployment benefits,"" Ruesterholz explained.
In light of this uncertainty, Ruesterholz said his firm expected the Fed to strike a ""patient tone"" in this meeting, ""wanting to ensure they do not overreact and slow the pace of recovery.""
He added that Insight Investment did not expect the Fed to ""rush into tapering"" in this meeting. Instead, the firm expected the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole in August a likelier starting point for discussion of tapering, ""paving the way for an official announcement potentially by December of this year.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/us-bonds-treasury-yields-dip-despite-looming-fed-policy-verdict.html

European stocks opened higher on Wednesday as UK inflation surged past the Bank of England (BoE) benchmark and investors await the US Federal Reserve interest rate announcement later on Wednesday.
The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) opened up 0.6% on Wednesday morning despite data showing the cost of living rose to the highest level since 2019 in May.
According to official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) the consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 2.1%, above the 2% BoE target. Analysts expected it to rise to 1.8%, from April's 1.5%.
Transport made the largest annual upward contribution to inflation. Rising prices for fuels, clothing, recreational goods such as games and recording media and meals pushed the rate higher on a monthly basis, rising 0.5% in May alone.
""The Bank of England was always expecting inflation to overshoot its target this spring, but it has taken the position that this is a short term blip caused by rock bottom prices a year earlier, and as soon as they naturally fall out of the figures, inflation will drop away again,"" said personal finance analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, Sarah Coles. ""It isn’t worried by the rise and it isn’t expecting to raise interest rates in the immediate future to bring it back down again.""

Elsewhere on the continent, France’s CAC (^FCHI) rose just over 0.1%, and the DAX (^GDAXI) was trading over 0.2% higher in Germany.
Oil prices are rallying as investors bet on looming supply crunch, with both benchmarks rising to record highs in recent days after hitting rock bottom last year. Crude (CL=F) was trading up 0.6% to $72.52 (£51.36), brent (BZ=F) was also up 0.6% to $74.41 around 8:30AM in London.
Across the Atlantic, US stocks were lower after retail sales figures showed Americans slowed their spending last month. US retail spending fell 1.3% in May amid supply chain disruptions and rising producer prices, according to data from the Commerce Department.
Story continues
Wall Street’s blue-chip S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed 0.2% down, the Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) crashed 0.7% on Tuesday.
The Fed is back in the fray and its two-day monetary policy meeting is the big event that could indicate whether the US central bank will tweak its interest rates outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicked off its meeting on Tuesday and chair Jerome Powell is expected to make concluding remarks on Wednesday.
Watch: What is inflation and why is it important?
Investors will keep a close tab on whether the Federal Reserve will stick with its dovish stance as optimism in America’s economy grows, and for any hint of Powell paring back the bond buying programme.
Economic indicators across the board have shown signs of improvement, most notably the US’ vaccination push, which reduced mortality rates. This comes against a backdrop of falling jobless claims, surging purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data and a spike in non-farm payrolls.
While jobless claims have dropped to pandemic-lows, the headline non-farm figure has repeatedly failed to match estimates in the last few months. This is important as Powell said he needs to see a ""string of strong jobs reports"" to consider tapering the Fed’s current stimulus programme.
Asian stocks struggled overnight as investors await Chinese retail and industrial production data.
The Nikkei (^N225) fell 0.5% in Japan after figures showed the country's trade surplus jumped 49.6% last month, compared to the year before.
Meanwhile, the Hang Seng (^HSI) fell 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) closed the session over 1% lower.

39,Fed expected to signal start of monetary policy shift debate,2021-06-16T07:00:02Z,Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit from the crisis-era policies the US central bank put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year.,"WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit from the crisis-era policies the US central bank put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year.
With US inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic.
Balanced against the improving economic terrain: The United States is still 7.5 million jobs short of where it was in early 2020, and the reopening of schools, concert venues and a host of other public areas remains a work in progress.
Daily coronavirus infections and deaths have plummeted, but only about half of those over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated, short of what epidemiologists feel is needed to squelch the virus for good and eliminate the risk of future localized outbreaks.
Any actual change in monetary policy is, as a result, likely months down the road as the Fed balances a variety of risks.
The central bank's latest policy statement, due to be released with fresh economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), is expected to err on the side of continuing the Fed's support for the economy until more workers are back on the job. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference to elaborate on the two-day meeting.
Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates.
""This is about getting the ball rolling,"" in a process that may take months to complete, and in a way that avoids any rapid shift in sentiment among investors or consumers that could damage the recovery in the meantime, wrote Tim Duy, chief US economist for SGH Macro Advisors and a University of Oregon professor focused on Fed policy.
LIFTOFF
The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers' views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024.
US job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving ""transitory,"" and hiring to accelerate as the nation's economic reopening continues.
The Fed has laid out an explicit test for any rate hike - including the need for inflation to not just reach but exceed the central bank's 2 percent target ""for some time"" in order to make up for years of inflation that was too low. The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed's preferred inflation measure to 3.6 percent. While that was the highest in 13 years, it was only one monthly reading and driven by factors officials feel will fade over time.
Still, the timing for the initial ""liftoff"" of rates could shift into 2023 if only two or three officials feel the improved outlook, or a too-fast-return of inflation, would warrant faster action - a change investors may read as particularly ""hawkish.""
Deutsche Bank's chief US economist, Matthew Luzzetti, wrote last week that he felt it a ""close call"" whether the Fed's updated ""dot plot"" of interest rate projections would advance an initial rate hike into next year, but that ultimately the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would see continued near-zero rates as more consistent with the path of the recovery and the management of the twin inflation and employment goals.
""With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed's transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed's views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,"" Luzzetti said.

TOKYO – Global shares were mixed in quiet trading Wednesday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting that may give clues on what lies ahead with its massive support for markets.
France's CAC 40 added 0.1% in early trading to 6,645.92, while Germany's DAX slipped 0.2% to 15,698.98. Britain's FTSE 100 gained nearly 0.1% to 7,176.83. U.S. shares were set to drift lower, with the future for the Dow industrials slipping 0.2% to 34,117, while the S&P 500 future fell nearly 0.1% to 4,233.62.
Trading in shares of Chinese property developer Soho China Ltd. was suspended in Hong Kong. Bloomberg reported that the Blackstone Group is close to a deal on acquiring the company in a deal that could be valued at $3 billion. The report cited unnamed “people familiar with the matter.""
The developer, which is known for eye-catching projects in prominent locations, issued a statement saying its shares were suspended from trading as of Tuesday under Hong Kong's takeover code.

Soho China's shares have surged 67% in the past month and nearly 30% in the past five days.
Japan released data that showed its trade surplus jumped 49.6% in May from the previous year, but analysts said that was less than expected and highlights how the world's third largest economy and its exports may be only slowly recovering from the pandemic.
Investors were also gauging data out of China on industrial production and retail sales, both of which showed growth signaling a recovery from the damage of the coronavirus pandemic.
Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.5% to finish at 29,291.01. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.6% to 3,278.68. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.1% to 7,386.20. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.7% to 28,436.84, while the Shanghai Composite fell 1.1% to 3,518.33.
“Asian markets are quiet ahead of the Fed,” said Robert Carnell, regional head of research Asia-Pacific at ING. “China’s data dump may stir things up a bit today, but the main focus will be on the Fed’s message and any hints they may give.”

The fear is that if higher inflation gets entrenched, the Fed may pull back on the $120 billion in monthly purchases of bonds it's pledged to keep mortgages cheap and longer-term interest rates low, and might raise short-term interest rates off their record low.
The Fed has so far said that it sees higher inflation as temporary. It will announce its latest decision on rate policy Wednesday afternoon.
“From a prices standpoint, we’re seeing inflationary pressure, and we believe the jury is still out on the timing and extent of when we see a leveling or whether this new new normal of higher prices is cemented,” said Greg Bassuk, founder and CEO of AXS Investments.
Most economists expect the Fed to say again on Wednesday that it sees higher inflation being only temporary, which would allow it to hold steady on its support for markets. But they also say Wednesday afternoon could offer the first sign that the Fed is mulling when to start slowing its purchases of bonds.

Many investors agree with the Fed’s view that higher inflation won’t last very long, and that it’s the expected result of an economy escaping out of pandemic lockdowns.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 8 cents to $72.20 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained $1.24 on Tuesday to $72.12 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $74.09 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 109.97 Japanese yen from 110.07 yen. The euro stood unchanged at $1.2127.

BANGKOK – Asian shares were mixed in quiet trading Wednesday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting that may give clues on what lies ahead with its massive support for markets.
Japan released data that showed its trade surplus jumped 49.6% in May from the previous year, but analysts said that was less than expected and highlights how the world's third largest economy and its exports may be only slowly recovering from the pandemic.
Investors are also watching data out of China on industrial production and retail sales for indications about the health of the regional economy.
Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.5% in afternoon trading to 29,291.86. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.7% to 3,280.45. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained nearly 0.1% to 7,386.20. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.4% to 28,522.99, while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.9% to 3,524.76.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 4,246.59 as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest-rates and other policies. A day earlier, the index hit an all-time high amid optimism about the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3% to 34,299.33. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.7% to 14,072.86.
The S&P 500 was down as much as 0.4% earlier in the day, after a report showed inflation on the wholesale level leaped last month by even more than economists expected. Prices for producers were 6.6% higher in May than a year earlier, the highest since 2010 and the latest evidence that inflation is bursting higher across the economy.
The fear is that if higher inflation gets entrenched, the Fed may pull back on the $120 billion in monthly purchases of bonds it's pledged to keep mortgages cheap and longer-term interest rates low, and might raise short-term interest rates off their record low.

A survey of fund managers said that 72% say inflation is only “transitory,” according to BofA Global Research. That has the majority saying that any upcoming drop in stock prices would likely be less than 10%.

There are limited signs that inflation may be cooling in some parts of the economy. Lumber and copper prices have dropped from their highs of a few weeks ago. Copper sank another 4.3% Tuesday, and miner Freeport-McMoRan's stock fell 4.8%.
Other reports on the economy Tuesday painted a mixed picture. Retail sales fell 1.3% in May from April, slamming into reverse after a 0.9% gain the prior month, for a much steeper drop than economists expected.
Part of that is likely the fading effect of payments the U.S. government sent to households earlier this year, which boosted spending in March and April. But economists said it could also be a sign that Americans are buying less and spending more on travel, eating out and other services as the economy reopens.

The dollar index stood at 90.499, having hit a one-month high of 90.677 on Tuesday despite mixed U.S. economic data.
U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May but sales in April were revised sharply up and are way above their pre-pandemic level.
With spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to travel and engage in other activities, the data cemented the perception of a strong recovery in the economy.
Separate data showed wholesale price inflation accelerated to 6.6%, the largest gain since November 2010.
Last week, consumer price data showed the sharpest rise in more than a dozen years, but hefty contributions from short-term increases in airline ticket prices and used cars suggested those price pressures may not last.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to acknowledge the first conversations among its policymakers about when and how fast to pare back the massive bond-buying program launched in 2020 when it concludes a policy meeting later in the day.
Yet most investors think the Fed will refrain from any hints of starting tapering its stimulus in the near future.
“The Fed has said they’re going to be reactionary to the data ... and they’ve said they want to see extended inflationary conditions before they make any commitment to tapering or hikes,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
Wakabayashi said the dollar should rally if the Fed drops any hint that tapering will be brought forward or rate hikes are going to be looked at sooner, but added, “I think they’ll stick to the same tagline, and it will probably end up being a non-event.”
Some market players also noted the dollar could rise by default as other major currencies appear to be losing momentum.
“We have to note that the U.S. dollar is strengthening now even as U.S. debt yield has dropped below 1.5%,” said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
“Today’s currency market suggests there is strong potential pressure to lift the dollar, should there be some sort of surprises from the Fed.”
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, whose climb in the first quarter helped buoy the dollar, sat at 1.4973% on Wednesday, after sinking as low as 1.4280% last week for the first time since early March.
The euro stood at $1.2129, little changed on the day but struggling to recover from its fall last week after the European Central Bank pledged to keep stimulus steady over the summer.
The yen was largely flat at 110.06 yen per dollar, near its two-month low of 110.325 touched earlier this month, with the Bank of Japan expected to extend some of its pandemic relief measures this week.
The British pound, a strong performer so far this year, hit a one-month low of $1.4035 on Tuesday despite stronger-than-expected employment data. It last stood at $1.40885.
The number of employees on British company payrolls surged by a record amount in May while pay growth marked its biggest rise since 2007 in April, although statisticians warned that this was distorted by comparisons with depressed wages a year ago and greater job losses among low-paid staff.
While UK job recovery looks set to continue as the economy reopens, the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, which forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to delay his plans to lift lockdown, is seen as a risk.
The Australian dollar lacked traction after the country’s central bank signalled on Tuesday its willingness to extend its bond purchase programme next month.
The currency changed hands at $0.7697, not far from a seven-week low of $0.7646 touched earlier this month.
In crypto markets, bitcoin traded at around $40,295, having hit a near one-month high of $41,341 on Tuesday, aided by the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and an upbeat tweet from Tesla boss Elon Musk.
Ether had less momentum, trading at around $2,530.",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-dollar-holds-near-one-month-high-with-focus-on-feds-inflation-take-idUSL3N2NY16J

A looming data dump on Chinese retail sales and industrial production offered another reason for caution, with some modest slowdown in annual growth expected.
Moves were mostly modest, apart from the oil market where Brent hit the highest since April 2019 on a potent mix of post-pandemic demand and restricted production.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.3%, while Chinese blue chips fell 1.1%.
Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.5%, but South Korean stocks rose 0.6% to a record high after five months of effort.
Both S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were little changed. EUROSTOXX 50 futures were also flat, while FTSE futures edged up 0.1%.
Dealers exercised caution ahead of the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day meeting later in the session.
Trading could be choppy around the event as forecasts from Fed members might read as hawkish, while the news conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell has tended to sound dovish.
“We think Chair Powell will indicate officials discussed talking about tapering, but tapering itself is still someway off given the Fed remains well short on making substantial progress on employment with payrolls still 7.3 million below pre-pandemic levels,” said NAB economics director Tapas Strickland.
Key will be Fed members’ projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only 7 out of 18 had seen such a move.
There could also be some upward movement in inflation projections for this year and next, given the last two readings on consumer prices surprised to the high side.
BofA’s latest survey of fund managers suggests most are sanguine on the outlook. Some 72% said inflation was transitory, while only 23% saw it as permanent.
“Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,” said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness.
The bond market certainly seemed untroubled with 10-year Treasury yields holding at 1.50%, just above a recent four-month low of 1.428%.
The Fed’s dogged dovishness has kept the dollar generally restrained, though it did eke out a one-month top overnight against a basket of currencies. The dollar index was last at 90.519.
The dollar was a shade firmer on the yen at 110.09, but short of resistance around 110.33. The euro was holding at $1.2128, having found support near $1.2090.
In commodity markets, gold was pinned at $1,858 an ounce and not far from a one-month trough of $1,843.
Copper lost some ground as China confirmed it would release some reserves of copper, aluminium and zinc to help contain recent price rises in commodities.
Oil prices continued their bullish run to hit their highest in more than two years amid signs of stronger demand and still tight supplies. [O/R]

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares declined further on Wednesday, weighed down by heavyweight Reliance Industries and financial stocks, with investors eyeing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy statement due later in the day.
The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index fell 0.43% to 15,804.20 and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.29% to 52,620.97 by 0457 GMT. Both the indexes closed at a record high on Tuesday.
“The market might be reluctant to push higher ahead of the Fed meeting. The possibility of further upsides depends heavily on the continuation of liquidity. If the Fed were to tighten the screws on interest rates, there is a possibility that markets may not see that as favourable,” said Anand James, chief market strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
If the Fed signals an idea of interest-rate hikes, the Indian market could expect the Reserve Bank of India to follow suit due to the country’s higher inflation reading. This may not be positive, especially as more states ease curbs, he said.
In Mumbai trading, Reliance Industries Ltd and HDFC Ltd were the top drags on the Nifty 50, shedding 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Shares of Reliance have gained in the last five trading sessions out of eight.
The Nifty Bank Index and the Nifty Private Bank Index have so far risen more than 0.30% this week.

With U.S. inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic. Graphic: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook:
Balanced against the improving economic terrain: The United States is still 7.5 million jobs short of where it was in early 2020, and the reopening of schools, concert venues and a host of other public areas remains a work in progress.
Daily coronavirus infections and deaths have plummeted, but only about half of those over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated, short of what epidemiologists feel is needed to squelch the virus for good and eliminate the risk of future localized outbreaks.
Any actual change in monetary policy is, as a result, likely months down the road as the Fed balances a variety of risks.
The central bank’s latest policy statement, due to be released with fresh economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), is expected to err on the side of continuing the Fed’s support for the economy until more workers are back on the job. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference to elaborate on the two-day meeting.
Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates.
""This is about getting the ball rolling,"" in a process that may take months to complete, and in a way that avoids any rapid shift in sentiment among investors or consumers that could damage the recovery in the meantime, wrote Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors and a University of Oregon professor focused on Fed policy. Graphic: Substantial further progress for the Fed? :
LIFTOFF
The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers’ views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024.
U.S. job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving “transitory,” and hiring to accelerate as the nation’s economic reopening continues.
The Fed has laid out an explicit test for any rate hike - including the need for inflation to not just reach but exceed the central bank’s 2% target “for some time” in order to make up for years of inflation that was too low. The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed’s preferred inflation measure to 3.6%. While that was the highest in 13 years, it was only one monthly reading and driven by factors officials feel will fade over time.
Still, the timing for the initial “liftoff” of rates could shift into 2023 if only two or three officials feel the improved outlook, or a too-fast-return of inflation, would warrant faster action - a change investors may read as particularly “hawkish.”
Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. economist, Matthew Luzzetti, wrote last week that he felt it a “close call” whether the Fed’s updated “dot plot” of interest rate projections would advance an initial rate hike into next year, but that ultimately the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would see continued near-zero rates as more consistent with the path of the recovery and the management of the twin inflation and employment goals.
“With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed’s transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed’s views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,” Luzzetti said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/wrapup-1-fed-expected-to-signal-start-of-monetary-policy-shift-debate-idUSL2N2NX1EJ

The dollar held near a one-month high against a basket of currencies as investors wondered if the Fed might alter the language on its stimulus following a recent jump in U.S. inflation. Any changes to the Fed's rhetoric could bring more volatility to major currencies, equities and bond markets as many economies are still struggling to recover from pandemic-induced slumps. Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at a three-week low of 6.4078 per dollar, 8 pips weaker than the previous fix of 6.407. In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 6.4040 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.4039 at midday, 31 pips firmer than the previous late session close. The onshore spot yuan swung in an extremely thin range of less than 30 pips in the morning session, reflecting caution ahead of the Fed's decision later in the day (1800 GMT) and Chair Jerome Powell's news conference (1830 GMT) Some analysts and market participants said that even if some U.S. economic data were not solid enough to force the Fed to start tapering any time soon, they could affirm a recovery in the world's largest economy was on track, which could alleviate upward pressure on the yuan. ""If U.S. and Europe recover their production, it would imply less demand for some Chinese goods. A moderation in China's export growth and smaller trade balances may ease some CNY's appreciation pressure,"" said Marco Sun, chief financial markets analyst at MUFG Bank in Shanghai. Sun expects a smaller chance of sustained one-way appreciation of the yuan in coming months. The yuan's strong rally to three-year highs against the dollar in May prompted a flurry of warnings from policymakers about speculative bets on the currency, prompting a slight pullback and more cautious trade. Separately, Guan Tao, a former senior official at China's foreign exchange regulator, warned that long-term appreciation in the yuan could have a large negative impact on China's economy even if there was no substantial effect on the country's exports in the short-term.

In Mumbai trading, Reliance Industries Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd were the top drags on the Nifty 50, shedding between 0.4% and 0.6%. Shares of Reliance have gained in the last five trading sessions out of eight.
The Nifty Bank Index and the Nifty Private Bank Index have so far risen more than 0.60% this week.
In the broader Asian market, shares were subdued on Wednesday, with investors looking to a much-anticipated Federal Reserve policy meeting to see if the central bank would signal any change to the U.S. monetary policy outlook.
Many investors expect the Fed to maintain its dovish stance at its two-day meeting from Tuesday. Some Fed board members, however, have said the central bank should start discussing tapering its bond-buying.",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-stocks/indian-shares-open-lower-on-losses-in-reliance-fed-meeting-eyed-idUSL3N2NY0UO

WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday brought forward its projections for the first post-pandemic interest rate hikes into 2023, citing an improved health situation and dropping a longstanding reference that the crisis was weighing on the economy.
New projections saw a majority of 11 of 18 U.S. central bank officials pencil in at least two quarter-percentage-point rate increases for 2023, even as officials pledged in a statement to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery.
That rate-hike view, coupled with a new forecast for three years of inflation running above the central bank's 2% target, suggests concerns about overheating have risen sharply inside the Fed's policy-setting committee.
""Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States"" the Fed said in a statement after its latest policy meeting, a substantial shift for an institution that has conditioned policy for the past 14 months on battling the pandemic.
The Fed reiterated its promise to await ""substantial further progress"" before beginning to shift to policies less tuned to the pandemic and more to a fully open economy.
The new language does not mean a change in policy is imminent: The Fed on Wednesday held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and said it will continue to buy $120 billion in bonds each month to fuel the economic recovery.
But new economic and interest rate projections appeared to add some urgency to the Fed's planning. Policymakers at the median now see the first rate increase coming in 2023 instead of 2024.
The projections showed the outlook for inflation jumping this year, though the price increases were still described as ""transitory"". Overall economic growth is expected to hit 7%.
Together, the projections were indicative of a recovery moving faster than anticipated, and justifying discussions about the next phase of policy for the Fed.
""This change in stance jars a little with the Fed’s recent claims that the recent spike in inflation is temporary,"" said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""The pressure is on to explain the change in stance without setting hares running.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news briefing at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the statement, and possibly provide more details on how the Fed's policy discussion will proceed.
JOBS SHORTFALL
The economy remains about 7.5 million jobs short of where it stood at the onset of the pandemic in February, 2020. Fed officials still describe that level as ""far"" from their goal of restoring maximum employment.
But, increasingly, they have also attributed the employment shortfall more to logistical issues around workers returning to jobs, factors which the Fed cannot easily change, than the strength of the economy. On the matters it can influence - the overall demand for goods and services, and the need for workers to provide them - the Fed feels it is closer to its goal.
There was roughly one job opening for every unemployed person as of May.
U.S. stocks dropped and bond yields rose after the release of the statement and the new economic and interest rate projections. The S&P 500 index (.SPX) was last down more than 1% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to about 1.55% from 1.49% before the statement's release.

Susan Walsh/Pool via REUTERS/Files
June 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday made technical adjustments aimed at keeping its key overnight benchmark interest rate from falling too low.
The Fed raised the interest rate it pays banks on reserves held at the U.S. central bank at the end of its two-day policy meeting. It also lifted the rate it pays on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, a tool used to set a floor on short-term interest rates.
The rate on reserves - known by the acronym IOER - will rise by five basis points to 0.15%. The rate paid on reverse repo operations, which gives financial firms a place to temporarily park cash in exchange for a return, will increase to 0.05% from zero.
Use of the reverse repo facility surged to new highs in recent weeks as money market funds and other eligible firms struggle to find places to invest their excess cash. read more Firms parked a record $583.9 billion in cash with the New York Fed overnight on Monday and stashed about $500 billion overnight with the Fed on both Tuesday and Wednesday.
Short-term interest rates are drifting lower in part because of the Fed’s $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, a surge in bank reserves and a big drop in the federal government’s cash stockpile as it doles out pandemic relief payments and tax refunds.
The fed funds rate, which the central bank on Wednesday kept in a target range of 0-0.25%, briefly dipped to 0.05% at the end of May and has held steady at 0.06% since early June. read more

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it may act sooner than previously planned to start dialing back the low-interest rate policies that have helped fuel a swift rebound from the pandemic recession but have also coincided with rising inflation.

“Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. Amid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened,” the Fed said in a statement.
The central bank also boosted its forecast for inflation to 3.4% by the end of this year, from 2.4% in its previous projection in March. Yet the officials foresee price increases remaining tame in the following two years. That outlook reflects Chair Jerome Powell's view that the current inflation spikes stem mainly from supply shortages and other temporary effects of the economy's swift reopening from the pandemic.
In addition to having pegged its key rate near zero since March of last year, the Fed has been buying $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bonds to try to hold down longer-term rates to encourage borrowing and spending.
The Fed officials are widely believed to have begun discussing a reduction in those monthly bond purchases at the policy meeting that ended Wednesday — a first step in pulling back on its efforts to stimulate the economy.
There was no mention of paring those bond purchases in the written statement the Fed issued after the meeting. But the topic is sure to come up at Powell’s news conference later Wednesday.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/16/business/fed-sees-faster-time-frame-rate-hikes-inflation-rises/

LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - World stock markets treaded water near record highs on Wednesday as investors braced for any hawkish signals from the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, and oil prices hit their highest since April 2019 on recovering demand.
Investor bullishness about the economic recovery after COVID-19 and ample stimulus from central banks and governments has propelled stocks to record highs and pushed volatility across asset classes to levels last seen before the pandemic roiled markets in March 2020.
But inflation is also rising in the United States and elsewhere. Data on Wednesday showed UK inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's 2.0% target in May and hit 2.1%, and inflation looks set to rise further as Britain reopens its economy. read more
That makes the tone and content of Wednesday's readout from the Fed's meeting more important for global markets. Officials are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit the policies introduced during the pandemic last year. read more
With markets having priced in the start of those talks about tapering but unsure whether rising inflation will encourage more aggressive action from the Fed and other central banks, some caution has crept in.
On Wednesday, the MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day.
The Euro STOXX 600 (.STOXX) was little changed. Britain's FTSE 100 (.FTSE) gained 0.24% and Germany's DAX (.GDAXI) shed 0.1%.
Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher , and Asian shares were weaker.
""The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting is highly unlikely to bring any changes to either rates or the pace of asset purchases,"" UniCredit analysts said.
""However, we expect the Fed to signal that, if the economy continues to recover strongly, it will likely be appropriate to begin to discuss a plan for tapering the pace of asset purchases at some point in upcoming meetings.""
Key will be Fed members' projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only seven out of 18 had seen such a move.
INFLATION PROJECTIONS
There could also be some upward movement in inflation projections for this year and next, as the last two readings on consumer prices surprised to the high side.
BofA's latest survey of fund managers suggests most are sanguine on the outlook. Some 72% said inflation was transitory. Only 23% saw it as permanent.
""Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,"" said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness.
Bond investors remain sanguine about the prospect of a shift in policy thinking.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields held at 1.494%, a quarter of a percentage point below 2021 highs, while the European Union raised 20 billion euros in 10-year debt yielding less than 0.1% amid near-record demand.
The only signs of investor nervousness were evident in currency markets where the dollar held near a one-month high .
Sterling gained 0.2% versus the dollar but at just above $1.41 remained within recent ranges. The euro traded at $1.213 .
In commodity markets, gold was pinned at $1,859 an ounce and not far from a one-month trough of $1,843.
Copper lost some ground as China confirmed it would release some reserves of the base metal, as well as aluminium and zinc to help contain recent price rises in commodities. read more
Oil prices continued their bullish run to hit their highest in more than two years amid signs of stronger demand and still tight supplies.
Brent climbed 37 cents to $74.36 a barrel and was aiming for the 2019 peak of $75.63, while U.S. crude added 54 cents to $72.66.
Cryptocurrency prices were calm, with Bitcoin holding a little above $40,000 .

SYDNEY, June 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares retreated slightly on Wednesday with investors wary of any hint of hawkishness from the U.S. Federal Reserve given lofty asset valuations rely so heavily on an endless supply of super-cheap money.
A looming data dump on Chinese retail sales and industrial production offered another reason for caution, with some modest slowdown in annual growth expected.
Moves were mostly modest, apart from the oil market where Brent hit the highest since April 2019 on a potent mix of post-pandemic demand and restricted production.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) dipped 0.3%, while Chinese blue chips (.CSI300) fell 1.1%.
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) eased 0.5%, but South Korean stocks (.KS11) rose 0.6% to a record high after five months of effort.
Both S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were little changed. EUROSTOXX 50 futures were also flat, while FTSE futures edged up 0.1%.
Dealers exercised caution ahead of the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting later in the session. read more
Trading could be choppy around the event as forecasts from Fed members might read as hawkish, while the news conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell has tended to sound dovish.
""We think Chair Powell will indicate officials discussed talking about tapering, but tapering itself is still someway off given the Fed remains well short on making substantial progress on employment with payrolls still 7.3 million below pre-pandemic levels,"" said NAB economics director Tapas Strickland.
Key will be Fed members' projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only 7 out of 18 had seen such a move.
There could also be some upward movement in inflation projections for this year and next, given the last two readings on consumer prices surprised to the high side.
BofA's latest survey of fund managers suggests most are sanguine on the outlook. Some 72% said inflation was transitory, while only 23% saw it as permanent.
""Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,"" said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness.
The bond market certainly seemed untroubled with 10-year Treasury yields holding at 1.50%, just above a recent four-month low of 1.428%.
The Fed's dogged dovishness has kept the dollar generally restrained, though it did eke out a one-month top overnight against a basket of currencies. The dollar index was last at 90.519 .
The dollar was a shade firmer on the yen at 110.09 , but short of resistance around 110.33. The euro was holding at $1.2128 , having found support near $1.2090.
In commodity markets, gold was pinned at $1,858 an ounce and not far from a one-month trough of $1,843.
Copper lost some ground as China confirmed it would release some reserves of copper, aluminium and zinc to help contain recent price rises in commodities.
Oil prices continued their bullish run to hit their highest in more than two years amid signs of stronger demand and still tight supplies.
Brent climbed 61 cents to $74.60 a barrel and was aiming for the 2019 peak of $75.63, while U.S. crude added 54 cents to $72.66.

NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Futures on the federal funds rate, which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Wednesday raised bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in early 2023 after Fed projections showed at least two rate increases that year.
The fed funds market showed a roughly 90% chance of a rate hike by January 2023. Prior to the Fed statement, the market fully priced in a rate increase by April 2023.
New projections saw 11 Fed officials, a majority, pencil in at least two quarter-point interest rate increases for 2023, even as officials in their statement pledged to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery. read more
""That's enough of a hawkish surprise for the bond market and it's getting all of the attention,"" said Frances Donald, global chief economist, Manulife Investment Management, in Toronto, reacting to the Fed's rate projections, or the so-called ""dot plot.""
""There has not been a material change of tone. This statement has only a few adjustments. The market is reacting to a few strands of information in the dot plot,"" said Donald.
In his press conference after the meeting, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said Fed projections do not represent a committee decision or plan.
For some context, on the ""dot plot,"" DRW Trading market strategist Lou Brien said Powell is not a fan of the dots as a rate forecast, but has said that ""they are useful in signaling Fed sentiment.""
Brien noted, for instance, that the December 2018 dot plot showed a U.S. rate forecast to near 3% by end-2019 during the Fed's hiking cycle. But rates never ticked higher and stood at 1.75% at the end of 2019.

Dollar Index at highest since May 6
LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped to a near six-week high on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve brought forward its projections for the first post-pandemic interest rate hikes into 2023, citing an improved health situation and dropping a long-standing reference that the crisis was weighing on the economy. read more
The dollar index , which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.63% at 91.103, its highest since May 6.
A majority of 11 Fed officials penciled in at least two quarter-point interest rate increases for 2023, even as officials in their statement pledged to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery.
The projections showed the outlook for inflation jumping this year, though the price increases were still described as ""transitory."" Overall economic growth is expected to hit 7%.
""The interesting thing is that the Fed has gone beyond simply acknowledging that inflation is rising and that the U.S. economy has a lot of momentum, and it has essentially shifted to a much more hawkish stance in this set of projections,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.39% to 110.49 yen, its highest since April 6.
The dollar, which slumped through much of 2020, staged a rebound earlier this year, but that relief rally appeared to run out of steam through May as investors remained convinced that the Fed will keep interest rates lower for longer as it seeks to support the economy.
While the Fed's new language does not mean a change in policy is imminent it does provide more support for the greenback, analysts said.
""I think we're back to talking about a mild rally in the U.S. dollar and the data becoming very important over the summer period prior to Jackson Hole and September's meeting,"" said Simon Harvey, senior FX market analyst at Monex Europe.
Risk-sensitive currencies logged a sharp reversal following the Fed announcement, with the New Zealand dollar down 0.98% at $0.7049 and the Australian dollar - which is seen as a proxy for risk appetite - up 0.95% at $0.7612 .
Sterling, which had strengthened against the dollar on Wednesday after data showed British inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's 2% target in May, gave up those gains to trade down 0.49%.
Meanwhile, bitcoin's recent rally appeared to run out of steam, as the world's largest cryptocurrency fell 4.34% to $38,430.03.

The Fed cited an improved economic outlook, with overall economic growth expected to hit 7% this year.
With inflation rising faster than expected and the economy bouncing back quickly, the market had been looking for clues of when the Fed may alter the policies put into place last year to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, including a massive bond-buying program.
The Fed reiterated its promise to await ""substantial further progress"" before beginning to shift to policies tuned to a fully open economy. It also held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and said it will continue to buy $120 billion in bonds each month to fuel the economic recovery.
However, investors interrepted the Fed's comments on rates as more hawkish than before.

Fed's Powell scheduled to hold news briefing
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday are expected to at least flag the pending start of talks about when and how to exit from the crisis-era policies the U.S. central bank put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year.
With U.S. inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic.
Balanced against the improving economic terrain: The United States is still 7.5 million jobs short of where it was in early 2020, and the reopening of schools, concert venues and a host of other public areas remains a work in progress.
Daily coronavirus infections and deaths have plummeted, but only about half of those over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated, short of what epidemiologists feel is needed to squelch the virus for good and eliminate the risk of future localized outbreaks.
Any actual change in monetary policy is, as a result, likely months down the road as the Fed balances a variety of risks.
The central bank's latest policy statement, due to be released with fresh economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), is expected to err on the side of continuing the Fed's support for the economy until more workers are back on the job. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference to elaborate on the two-day meeting.
Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates.
""This is about getting the ball rolling,"" in a process that may take months to complete, and in a way that avoids any rapid shift in sentiment among investors or consumers that could damage the recovery in the meantime, wrote Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors and a University of Oregon professor focused on Fed policy.
LIFTOFF
The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers' views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024.
U.S. job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving ""transitory,"" and hiring to accelerate as the nation's economic reopening continues.
The Fed has laid out an explicit test for any rate hike - including the need for inflation to not just reach but exceed the central bank's 2% target ""for some time"" in order to make up for years of inflation that was too low. The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed's preferred inflation measure to 3.6%. While that was the highest in 13 years, it was only one monthly reading and driven by factors officials feel will fade over time.
Still, the timing for the initial ""liftoff"" of rates could shift into 2023 if only two or three officials feel the improved outlook, or a too-fast-return of inflation, would warrant faster action - a change investors may read as particularly ""hawkish.""
Deutsche Bank's chief U.S. economist, Matthew Luzzetti, wrote last week that he felt it a ""close call"" whether the Fed's updated ""dot plot"" of interest rate projections would advance an initial rate hike into next year, but that ultimately the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would see continued near-zero rates as more consistent with the path of the recovery and the management of the twin inflation and employment goals.
“With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed’s transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed’s views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,” Luzzetti said.

June 16 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq drifted just below record highs on Wednesday, with investors on edge before potential hints from the Federal Reserve on when it would taper its massive monetary stimulus.

WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it did not expect the Federal Reserve's projections for earlier post-pandemic interest rate hikes to significantly alter its own forecasts for longer-term rates and the cost of borrowing to fund planned investments.
A White House official welcomed the Fed's forecast for 7% growth in the U.S. economy given an improved health situation, saying it showed that President Joe Biden's push to accelerate vaccinations and get people back to work was paying off.
Fed officials on Wednesday projected an accelerated timetable for interest rate increases, beginning in 2023 instead of 2024, and said the 15-month health emergency was no longer a core restraint on U.S. commerce. read more
The White House official said the Biden administration would update its own economic forecasts in coming months to reflect an improving economy, but still believed that real debt service rates on the U.S. debt would remain negative to very slightly positive over the next decade.
That was still well below historic norms, and meant Biden's budget plans remained fiscally prudent, the official said.
Biden last month sent Congress a $6 trillion budget plan that would ramp up spending on infrastructure, education and combating climate change, arguing it made good fiscal sense to invest now, when the cost of borrowing was cheap. read more
While rates on U.S. Treasury securities have increased from record lows seen at the height of the pandemic last year, the government's borrowing costs should stay ""well below"" historical levels over the coming decade, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Wednesday.
The White House official also welcomed what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's forecast for a ""very strong labor market"" and his observation that economists had consistently underestimated the amount of capacity during the last expansion and recovery.
Getting people back to work quickly was the guiding principle behind the president's economic strategy to ""get shots in arm and checks in pockets,"" the official said, adding that those short-term measures would be strengthened through longer-term planned investments in child care and paid leave.

June 16 (Reuters) - The three main Wall Street indexes all closed down on Wednesday, as U.S. Federal Reserve officials unnerved investors with indications that the central bank could begin rising interest rates in 2023, a year earlier than expected.
New projections saw a majority of 11 of 18 U.S. central bank officials pencil in at least two quarter-percentage-point rate increases for 2023. Officials also pledged to keep policy supportive for now to encourage an ongoing jobs recovery.
The Fed cited an improved economic outlook, with overall economic growth expected to hit 7% this year. Still, investors were surprised to learn officials were mulling rate hikes earlier than 2024.
“At first blush, the dot plot which projected two hikes by 2023 was more hawkish than expected, and markets reacted as such,” said Daniel Ahn, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose on the Fed news, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose to a six-week peak.
With inflation rising faster than expected and the economy bouncing back quickly, the market had been looking for clues of when the Fed may alter the policies put into place last year to combat the economic fallout from the pandemic, including a massive bond-buying program.
The Fed reiterated its promise to await “substantial further progress” before beginning to shift to policies tuned to a fully open economy. It also held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and said it will continue to buy $120 billion in bonds each month to fuel the economic recovery.
“Chair Powell has signaled, while the committee is not yet ready to taper, it is now in the minds of the committee. They’ve retired the phrase ‘thinking about thinking about tapering’, and we expect that in the next few meetings, the committee will likely formally start discussions of tapering,” BNP’s Ahn said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.66 points, or 0.77%, to 34,033.67, the S&P 500 lost 22.89 points, or 0.54%, to 4,223.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33.17 points, or 0.24%, to 14,039.68.
Only two of the S&P’s 11 main sector indexes ended in positive territory: consumer discretionary and retail.
The decliners were led by utilities, materials, and consumer staples.

72,"Australia, NZ dlrs on the defensive in case Fed, RBA make policy waves",2021-06-16T03:54:23Z,"The Australian and New Zealand dollars were on the defensive on Wednesday in case a policy meeting of the Federal Reserve produces even a whisper of stimulus reduction, which could also threaten the recent rally in bonds.","SYDNEY, June 16 (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealand dollars were on the defensive on Wednesday in case a policy meeting of the Federal Reserve produces even a whisper of stimulus reduction, which could also threaten the recent rally in bonds.
The Aussie steadied at $0.7693, having slipped as far as $0.7675 overnight. Major support is not far away at the June low of $0.7646 and a breach would risk a retreat to $0.7580.
The kiwi was looking vulnerable at $0.7136, after briefly breaking support at $0.7116 overnight. It risks a return to $0.7070 or even $0.7000.
Much depends on whether Fed members lift forecasts for rates and inflation, and whether Chair Jerome Powell stays dovish in his post-meeting news conference.
“From a market perspective, the key will be whether the FOMC began ‘talking about talking’ about tapering its asset purchases,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “We think that is a strong likelihood.”
“However, we think Fed Chair Powell will strongly emphasise that this is just the beginning of an extended discussion,” he added. “Indeed, we suspect that he will reiterate that the recent jump in inflation is ‘transitory’.”
Market thinking on domestic policy could also change when Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe gives a speech on the economy on Thursday.
Minutes of its June meeting showed it would consider a number of possible revisions to its bond buying campaign at its July policy meeting. “Given the sharp V-shaped recovery that is now evident, we think it appropriate to pull back a little on unusually aggressive policy accommodation, and we think the governor should set out a carefully crafted case for doing so,” argued Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst.
He expects the RBA will not extend its yield target to November 2024, but will set another round of bond buying albeit at a slower pace than the present A$5 billion s week.
Expectations that the yield target will remain tied to the April 2024 bond led to a sharp shift in three-year bond futures when the June contract expired on Tuesday.
The September contract is trading at 99.660, implying a yield of 0.34%, while the June contract had ended at 99.846 for a yield of 0.154%.
The move in 10-year bond futures was more modest, with the September contract at 98.4500 compared to the June close at 98.5510. Cash 10-year yields held at 1.49% having rallied to a four-month low of 1.418% last week.

A looming data dump on Chinese retail sales and industrial production offered another reason for caution, with some modest slowdown in annual growth expected.
Moves were modest, except in the oil market where prices hit the highest since April 2019 on a potent mix of post-pandemic demand and restricted production.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan barely moved, while Chinese blue chips dipped 0.3%.
Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.2%, but South Korean stocks rose 0.6% to a record high after five months of effort.
Both S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were all but unchanged. EUROSTOXX 50 futures rose 0.1% and FTSE futures 0.3%.
For dealers, discretion was the better part of valour ahead of the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day meeting later in the session.
Trading could be choppy around the event as forecasts from Fed members might read as hawkish, while the news conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell has tended to sound dovish.
“We think Chair Powell will indicate officials discussed talking about tapering, but tapering itself is still someway off given the Fed remains well short on making substantial progress on employment with payrolls still 7.3 million below pre-pandemic levels,” said NAB economics director Tapas Strickland.
Key will be Fed members’ projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023. Previously only 7 out of 18 had seen such a move.
There could also be some upward movement in inflation projections for this year and next, given the last two readings on consumer prices surprised to the high side.
BofA’s latest survey of fund managers suggests most are sanguine on the outlook. Some 72% said inflation was transitory, while only 23% saw it as permanent.
“Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,” said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness.
The bond market certainly seemed untroubled with 10-year Treasury yields holding at 1.50%, just above a recent four-month low of 1.428%.
The Fed’s dogged dovishness has kept the dollar generally restrained, though it did eke out a one-month top overnight against a basket of currencies. The dollar index was last at 90.519 and going nowhere for now.
The dollar was a shade firmer on the yen at 110.09, but short of resistance around 110.33. The euro was holding at $1.2122, having found support near $1.2090.
In commodity markets, gold was pinned at $1,854 an ounce and not far from a one-month trough of $1,843.
Oil prices continued their bullish run to hit their highest in more than two years amid signs of stronger demand and still tight supplies.

The dollar index stood at 90.528, having hit a one-month high of 90.677 on Tuesday despite mixed U.S. economic data.
U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May but sales in April were revised sharply up and are way above their pre-pandemic level.
With spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to travel and engage in other activities, the data cemented the perception of a strong recovery in the economy.
Separate data showed wholesale price inflation accelerated to 6.6%, the largest gain since November 2010.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to acknowledge the first conversations among its policymakers about when and how fast to pare back the massive bond-buying program launched in 2020 when it concludes a policy meeting later in the day.
Yet most investors think the Fed will refrain from any hints of starting tapering its stimulus in the near future.
“The Fed has said they’re going to be reactionary to the data, ....and they’ve said they want to see extended inflationary conditions before they make any commitment to tapering or hikes,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank.
Wakabayashi said the dollar should rally if the Fed drops any hint that tapering will be brought forward or rate hikes are going to be looked at sooner, but added, “I think they’ll stick to the same tagline, and it will probably end up being a non-event.”
Some market players also noted the dollar could rise by default as other major currencies appear to be losing momentum.
“We have to note that the U.S. dollar is strengthening now even as U.S. debt yield has dropped below 1.5%,” said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
“Today’s currency market suggests there is strong potential pressure to lift the dollar, should there be some sort of surprises from the Fed.”
The euro stood at $1.2126, little changed on the day but struggling to recover from its fall last week after the European Central Bank pledged to keep stimulus steady over the summer.
The yen was flat at 110.08 yen per dollar, near its two-month low of 110.325 touched earlier this month, with the Bank of Japan expected to extend some of its pandemic relief measures this week.
The British pound, a strong performer so far this year, hit a one-month low of $1.4035 on Tuesday despite stronger-than-expected employment data. It last stood at $1.4085.
The number of employees on British company payrolls surged by a record amount in May while pay growth marked its biggest rise since 2007 in April although statisticians warned that this was distorted by comparisons with depressed wages a year ago and greater job losses among low-paid staff.
While UK job recovery looks set to continue as the economy reopens, the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, which forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to delay his plans to lift lockdown, is seen as a risk.
The Australian dollar lacked traction after the country’s central bank signalled on Tuesday its willingness to extend its bond purchase programme next month.
The currency changed hands at $0.7685, not far from a seven-week low of $0.7646 touched earlier this month.
In crypto markets, bitcoin traded at $40,305, having hit a near one-month high of $41,341 on Tuesday, aided by the promise of fresh investment from major backer MicroStrategy and an upbeat tweet from Tesla boss Elon Musk.

76,COLUMN-Faster U.S. wage rises will help entrench inflation: Kemp,2021-06-16T01:00:48Z,"The result should be a strong and sustained expansion in consumer spending and business activity over the next year, which will be welcomed by policymakers at the central bank and in the White House. However, it will also fuel faster inflation and probably force the Federal Reserve to scale back its bond buying programme and raise interest rates earlier than top policymakers have indicated so far.","U.S. employees are feeling confident enough to push for better pay and conditions, despite the high level of unemployment after the pandemic, a sign the balance of power is shifting in the job market. The result should be a strong and sustained expansion in consumer spending and business activity over the next year, which will be welcomed by policymakers at the central bank and in the White House.
However, it will also fuel faster inflation and probably force the Federal Reserve to scale back its bond buying programme and raise interest rates earlier than top policymakers have indicated so far. The total number of non-farm employees is still down by more than 7.5 million compared with February 2020, the last month before the first wave of the pandemic hit the economy.
But in April, the proportion of employees who quit their jobs voluntarily rose to the highest rate for more than two decades, according to separations data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The seasonally-adjusted quit rate rose to 2.7%, up from 2.3% in the same month two years ago, before the pandemic, and the highest since this time series started in 2001 (https://tmsnrt.rs/3wwWbGE).
In response, employee compensation has started to rise faster as businesses and other private-sector organisations try to hold on to experienced workers by raising wages, salaries and other benefits. For private employees, total compensation costs have risen by 2.9% over the last year and at a compound annual rate of 2.8% over the last two years, according to a separate survey by the BLS.
Compensation is rising at the fastest rate since the strong economy of 2018 and before that the pre-financial crisis economy of 2008 (https://tmsnrt.rs/3iFsoY7). RUNNING HOTTER
Strategy for both the Federal Reserve and the White House is dominated by the need to avoid a repeat of the unusually low quit rates and weak compensation growth between 2010 and 2016. More labour market turnover and faster compensation growth will therefore be welcomed by policymakers anxious to repeat the subdued business cycle expansion after the last recession and the ensuing populist revolt.
Quit rates are critical to compensation growth. In general, most employees achieve larger wage gains when moving from one organisation to another rather than when they stay within the same organisation. More turnover should therefore compel employers to raise pay faster, with benefits for households in the lower half of the income distribution, which depend more heavily on income from wages and salaries.
Both the central bank and White House want to run the economy relatively hot to maximise employment opportunities, job switching, and therefore wage and income gains for lower-income households. ""Economic ‘heat’ does not necessarily equate with overheating,"" the White House Council of Economic Advisers noted in April, in a lengthy statement designed to forestall fears about a temporary rise in inflation.
FASTER INFLATION Accelerating compensation growth is likely to generate faster inflation by increasing consumer incomes and spending power, as well as raising business costs, encouraging firms to restore margins through price increases.
The Federal Reserve and the White House have been relatively sanguine about this scenario; both have said that somewhat faster inflation is a policy objective, after the below-target rates earlier in the decade. Compensation increases running at 2.8% per year should be fast enough to accommodate inflation rates of 2.50-2.75% per year, probably in line with the Fed’s undeclared target.
The problem will come if compensation increases continue to accelerate, sustain a faster rate of inflation and perhaps even push it higher. THE LAST CYCLE
The Fed and the White House are focused on avoiding a repeat of the problems following the recession of 2008/09, but the current recovery looks nothing like the previous one. Like the proverbial generals fighting the last war, central bank officials may have absorbed lessons from the last economic cycle just as the nature of the problem has changed.
The Fed’s commitment to continue buying bonds and holding interest rates near zero throughout 2022 into 2023 is an insurance policy against an anticipated weak and inconsistent economic upswing. So far, however, the expansion is proving strong, as households have boosted spending on merchandise, and the end of pandemic control measures is unleashing pent-up demand in the service sector.
The Fed therefore has a time-consistency problem. If fiscal and monetary stimulus succeed in generating a strong recovery, heat will turn to overheating, and stimulus will have to be withdrawn or reversed earlier than officials have indicated. If stimulus has to be continued through to 2023, as the Fed says it expects, that would be a sign the fiscal and monetary measures have not been effective, and the economy remains stuck in a low gear.
COMMODITY PRICES The combination of a strong recovery in the United States with income gains among lower income households and lots of fiscal and monetary stimulus should keep demand for merchandise high.
Faster growth in merchandise consumption will keep global supply chains and freight transportation systems stretched through the remainder of this year and 2022. Prices for a broad range of energy and non-energy commodities are already rising rapidly and are likely to continue escalating as the global economic cycle matures.
The longer the Fed maintains maximum stimulus now to insure against any loss of momentum in the early stages of the recovery, the greater the risk of overheating as the cycle progresses. More policy support now could translate into a more abrupt and disruptive turnaround later, a point made by several of the Fed’s most prominent critics, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
In the meantime, the combination of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus in the United States and Europe is creating near-ideal conditions for a big rise in commodity consumption and prices in the short term. Related columns:
