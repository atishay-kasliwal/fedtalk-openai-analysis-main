197,"It will be important to see “the totality of data (jobs and inflation), the evolving outlook and the balance of risks or consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labour market”, he added."
198,"“If that test is met, the reduction of policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell added while hinting at a rate cut in September."

200,"The last interest rate cut in the US took place on March 15, 2020."

203,"On inflation, the US central bank said it “has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated”."
204,"In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 per cent inflation objective."

206,The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.
207,"The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
208,The US central bank has been holding the interest rates for the past one year since July 2023.
209,"Before that, between March 2022 and July 2023, the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by 525 basis points to control inflation, which hit a multi-decade high amid the Ukraine-Russia war and COVID restrictions."

 8 minutes
 (Bloomberg) — Stocks staged a powerful rebound amid a rally in beaten-down chipmakers, with the latest economic data bolstering bets the Federal Reserve will signal a rate cut in September."
221,"Following a selloff that put the Nasdaq 100 on the brink of a correction, the tech-heavy gauge climbed 3%."
222,Nvidia Corp. surged 12% after being renamed the top US chip pick by Morgan Stanley analysts.
223,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. jumped on a bullish outlook.
224,"As Meta Platforms Inc. gets ready to report earnings, investors hope it can do a better job than Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in convincing Wall Street that lofty spending on AI will pay off."
225,It’s Fed day — which looms over a busy period for earnings and a heavy newsflow that just won’t let up.
226,"The central bank isn’t expected to lower rates Wednesday, despite calls from some former policymakers."
227,"Even if officials generally believe rates should be lower, they could spook the market by moving suddenly."
228,"If they wait, they need to have a clear reason why."
229,"“If you say you’re waiting until the next meeting because you want to see some data between now and the next meeting, that makes markets wonder ‘OK, well, what is it that could derail a rate cut between now and the next meeting?’,” Former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg Television."
230,"“If you do react to that data, that’s kind of data-point dependent.”
 To Thierry Wizman at Macquarie, the Fed will need to “thread a needle.”
 “A too-strong signal of a coming September rate cut may scare traders into thinking that the Fed sees abrupt economic weakness ahead,” he noted."
231,"“A too-weak signal, where a rate cut hinges on the data ‘evolving as we expect’ in the context of lingering attentiveness to inflation may not sound satisfactory to the bulls.”
 The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%."
232,A Bloomberg gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps jumped 3%.
233,The $22 billion VanEck Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SMH) climbed 6%.

 The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.5%."
240,"Oil jumped after Hamas said Israel killed its political leader, stoking geopolitical risks."
241,The yen rallied as the Bank of Japan raised interest rates and announced plans to cut bond purchases.
242,"Fed officials are likely to move closer to lowering rates from a two-decade high by signaling a potential rate cut in September, though they may stop short of providing details beyond that."
243,The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2 p.m. in Washington.
244,Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.
245,"Powell’s press conference is the usual “wild card,” according to Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
 “While risks are skewed that Powell leans dovish, we do not expect him to validate the aggressive easing that’s priced in by the markets,” they noted."
246,A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 75% of investors believe that officials will first cut because of a soft landing and that inflation is on a Fed-friendly path toward sub-3%.
247,So there will be a cut because policy doesn’t need to be as restrictive.
248,“This is 11% higher than when we asked last month.
249,"Investor confidence around a soft-landing is increasing,” said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V."
250,"In addition, 44% of the investors polled by 22V expect the Fed meeting/presser to be “mixed/negligible,” 38% believe “risk-on” and 18% “risk-off.”

251,American companies added the fewest number of workers since the start of the year and wage growth slowed.
252,"Separately, pending home sales rose for the first time in three months."
253,"“The Fed could justify a rate cut today based on current data on the job market and inflation, as well as the plausible case for both to cool in the near term,” said Bill Adams at Comerica Bank."
254,"“But the Fed is also concerned about their credibility, which they fear may have been dented by inflation’s overshoot in the last three years.”
 The road ahead for investors is looking rough right now as policy gatherings by the world’s most important central banks come at the start of what’s historically the worst two months for US stock returns."
255,"In the past three decades, the S&P 500 in August and September has averaged respective losses of 0.5% and 0.7%, data compiled by Bloomberg show."
256,Those seasonal patterns create another headache for traders since the broadening of this year’s powerful stock-market rally hangs on what the Fed signals about interest rates once its two-day meeting wraps up this afternoon.
257,"“We continue to see a favorable backdrop for US equities and advise investors to maintain a full allocation to the US market,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management."
258,"“We believe AI beneficiaries should continue to account for a substantial part of portfolios as the technology drives further growth in the years ahead, but we also see opportunities in other quality companies, including those exposed to secular trends like the energy transition, blue economy, and water scarcity.”

 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady Wednesday while opening the door to a September cut if inflation continues to show progress."
591,The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday while opening the door to a September cut if inflation continues to show progress.
592,Investors will be watching for clues about the path forward in a post-meeting statement from Fed officials and a 2:30 pm ET press conference with Fed Chair Jay Powell.
593,The Fed could make some changes to its policy statement touting more progress toward the central bank's 2% inflation goal.
594,it could also acknowledge a recent cooling in the job market.
595,"Powell could also decide at his press conference to provide a stronger signal about monetary policy, perhaps even reinforcing market expectations of a likely cut at the Fed's next meeting on September 17-18."
596,"ADVERTISEMENT
 ""We think Chair Powell will offer that the latest inflation readings add to the Fed’s confidence that inflation will head towards the 2% inflation target,"" said Morgan Stanley chief economist Ellen Zetner."
597,"At the same time, ""we think he will again note that the labor market is in better balance,"" she added."
598,Traders and investors will be listening closely today for any clues about the future direction of monetary policy.

 Some key Fed officials have been emphasizing in the weeks leading up to Wednesday's meeting that they are getting closer to having confidence inflation is sustainably dropping to their 2% goal."
600,"They have also made it clear they are paying more attention to rising unemployment, another sign that cuts may be nearing."
601,"Most Fed watchers say the central bank still needs just a bit more time to be sure, while also preparing the markets for the significant action to come."
602,The latest reassurance that a cut could be nearing came Friday when a new reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — showed its lowest annual gain in more than three years.
603,The 2.6% annual increase in the month of June was the same level as May and down from 2.8% in April.
604,"On a three-month annualized rate, core PCE dropped back to 2.3% from 2.9%."
605,"Story continues
 Another inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has also shown progress."
606,"On a ""core"" basis — which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control — CPI rose 3.3% year over year in the month of June."
607,That was down from 3.4% in May and 3.6% in April.
608,"Some Fed watchers do argue the Fed has the basis to support a cut at its meeting this week, even as they note they don’t expect it to happen."
609,"""I don't see a reason within the economic data that they should not cut this meeting,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley."

 The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months."
618,"Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months."
619,The move would pave the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
620,"While the central bank said it will continue to hold rates at current levels, Fed officials are now wary of any risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement."
621,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked up inflation’s recent progress in his post-meeting news conference, saying “the second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.” He also conveyed that since the job market seems to be back to a pre-pandemic normal, any additional cooling could be concerning for the Fed."
622,The Fed’s latest policy statement also suggested that officials view inflation as less of an issue now than at their June meeting.
623,"This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs."
624,"Powell doubled down on his point that determining when to cut rates will be “a very difficult judgement call.” There are consequences both if the Fed cuts too soon, and if it cuts too late."
625,"Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged."
626,"That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point."
627,"In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment."
628,"Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest meeting, news conference and policy statement."
629,"Powell cheers inflation’s slowdown and the economy’s resilience
 It’s crucial for the Fed’s top policymaker to sound confident about inflation before the central bank can begin cutting interest rates, and confident he sounded."
630,"Powell said “inflation has eased notably over the past few years, but remains somewhat elevated from our longer run goal of 2%.” The Fed’s statement also described inflation as “somewhat” elevated, which wasn’t a word that had been used before to describe inflation since the Fed began to lift rates in early 2022."
631,"The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target."
632,"The Fed is still very much wary about inflation, but a bit less so now."
633,"Powell even said that “we don’t need to be 100% focused on inflation.” Indeed, the second quarter really gave Fed officials a huge relief."
634,"That wasn’t just because inflation resumed a downward trend, but also because economic growth remained solid."
635,"The government’s latest report on gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions."
636,Powell called that a “historically unusual” development.
637,"“This is such a welcome outcome for the people we serve,” Powell said."
638,"“What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?"
639,"And this is part of that.”
 All eyes on America’s job market
 The future of the job market is now top of mind for the Fed."
640,"Employers aren’t hiring at the same pace they have in recent years, it’s become a lot tougher for unemployed Americans to find a new job, demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%."
641,The Fed is responsible for keeping the labor market intact.
642,"Powell described that slower momentum as an “ongoing gradual normalization,” considering the job market was once running red-hot after it rebounded mightily from the pandemic-induced recession in 2020."
643,"But he noted that any significant weakening would be concerning since the job market is “back to where it was on the eve of the pandemic,” he said."
644,"“I wouldn’t say we don’t want to see any other cooling; it would have to be a material difference: If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to,” he said."
645,"“I think we’re in a good place here.”
 The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US job market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday."
646,"A highly unusual economic cycle
 It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist."
647,"The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom."
648,"Powell said it’s highly unclear how the economy will unfold, adding that effects from the Covid-19 pandemic have undermined conventional wisdom, but he said “history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
 Plus, it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy."
649,"For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart."
650,"Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences."
651,"In theory, American shoppers should be tapping out soon, which could spell trouble for the job market."
652,"However, last year, the economy’s sheer resilience shocked economists who widely expected a recession, which never happened."
653,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that greater progress has been made in reducing inflation to its 2% target, a sign that the central bank is moving closer toward cutting its key interest rate for the first time in four years."
654,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that greater progress has been made in reducing inflation to its 2% target, a sign that the central bank is moving closer toward cutting its key interest rate for the first time in four years."
655,"In a statement issued after it concluded its two-day meeting, the Fed also said that “job gains have moderated” and acknowledged that the unemployment rate has risen."
656,"The Fed is required by Congress to pursue stable prices and maximum employment, and the statement said the central bank is “attentive to the risks” to both goals, a shift after several years of focusing exclusively on combatting inflation."
657,"Fed policymakers also chose to keep their key rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%, even as many Democratic elected officials and some economists have pushed for lower rates to bolster the economy and prevent job cuts."
658,"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have argued that a rate cut before the election would appear politically motivated."
659,"Before the Fed's decision, financial market traders had priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets."
660,The Fed typically seeks to avoid surprising investors with its rate decisions.
661,"The Fed is seeking to strike a delicate balance: It wants to keep rates high enough for long enough to quell inflation, which has fallen to 2.5% from a peak two years ago of 7.1%, according to its preferred measure."
662,But it also wants to avoid keeping borrowing costs so high that it triggers a recession.
663,"So far, it is on track for a so-called “soft landing,” in which inflation falls to 2% without a recession."
664,"Yet with the unemployment rate ticking higher for three months in a row, some economists have raised concerns that the Fed should have cut rates Wednesday or should cut them more quickly later this year."
665,"“The finish line is in sight and it would be tragic for the Fed to stumble and fall, with one-tenth of a mile left in the marathon, which is what I think they would be doing if they don’t start cutting,” Bharat Ramamurti, an advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project and former economist in the Biden White House, said on a call with reporters."
666,"Also Wednesday, three Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, urged Chair Jerome Powell in a letter to cut rates."
667,The letter charged that a failure to reduce borrowing costs soon would suggest the Fed is “giving in to bullying” and would itself be a political move.
668,"In the latest piece of good news on price increases, last Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure."
669,"That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate."
670,"At the same time, the unemployment rate has risen by nearly a half-percentage point this year to a still-low 4.1% and hiring has slowed."
671,"Powell and other Fed officials have highlighted they are increasingly focused on the risk that the job market could falter, another reason markets expect rate cuts soon."
672,"The government will issue the latest jobs numbers this Friday, and economists forecast that it will say employers added 175,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained 4.1%."

 US Federal Reserve Meet: Stay updated on the US Fed meeting today and the anticipated interest rates outcome."
843,Learn how changes in the Fed's policy may impact the economy and markets.
844,US Fed Meeting LIVE Updates: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 per cent.
845,This is in line with market expectations.
846,"The two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate-setting authority in the US, concluded on Wednesday."
847,US Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted at a rate cut in September.
848,"Addressing reporters post the FOMC decision, US Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his speech on Wednesday said, “Inflation has eased notably over the past two years”."
849,"However, he added that reducing interest rates too soon may reverse the progress on inflation."
850,"It will be important to see “the totality of data (jobs and inflation), the evolving outlook and the balance of risks or consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labour market”, he added."
851,"“If that test is met, the reduction of policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell added while hinting at a rate cut in September."
852,The next US Fed’s FOMC meeting will take place on September 17-18.
853,"The last interest rate cut in the US took place on March 15, 2020."
854,"“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 per cent,” the US Federal Reserve said in a statement on Wednesday."
855,"On future rate decisions, it said that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC “will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks”."
856,"On inflation, the US central bank said it “has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated”."
857,"In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 per cent inflation objective."
858,The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
859,The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.
860,"The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
861,The US central bank has been holding the interest rates for the past one year since July 2023.
862,"Before that, between March 2022 and July 2023, the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by 525 basis points to control inflation, which hit a multi-decade high amid the Ukraine-Russia war and COVID restrictions."
863,A basis point is 100th of a percentage point.
864,"However, now, the retail inflation in the US has fallen steadily closer to the Fed’s 2% target for the past several months."
865,"According to the latest data, yearly inflation in the US fell to 2.5% in July."
866,The separate latest data showed that the US economy also grew faster than expected at 2.8 per cent in the second quarter solid gains in consumer spending and business investment.
867,The Q2 GDP growth was double the 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter.
868,"What Does It Mean for the Indian Markets, Gold Prices?"
869,The status quo by the US Federal Reserve has already been factored in by the markets.
870,"However, the possibility of a rate cut in September will have a positive impact on the Indian market, which has been hovering near the magical 25,000 on Nifty for the last few days."
871,"The possibility of a rate cut in September will cause gold and equity prices to rise, said Amit Goel, co-founder & chief global strategist, Pace 360."
872,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks staged a powerful rebound amid a rally in beaten-down chipmakers, with the latest economic data bolstering bets the Federal Reserve will signal a rate cut in September."

 8 minutes
 (Bloomberg) — Stocks staged a powerful rebound amid a rally in beaten-down chipmakers, with the latest economic data bolstering bets the Federal Reserve will signal a rate cut in September."
874,"Following a selloff that put the Nasdaq 100 on the brink of a correction, the tech-heavy gauge climbed 3%."
875,Nvidia Corp. surged 12% after being renamed the top US chip pick by Morgan Stanley analysts.
876,Advanced Micro Devices Inc. jumped on a bullish outlook.
877,"As Meta Platforms Inc. gets ready to report earnings, investors hope it can do a better job than Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in convincing Wall Street that lofty spending on AI will pay off."
878,It’s Fed day — which looms over a busy period for earnings and a heavy newsflow that just won’t let up.
879,"The central bank isn’t expected to lower rates Wednesday, despite calls from some former policymakers."
880,"Even if officials generally believe rates should be lower, they could spook the market by moving suddenly."
881,"If they wait, they need to have a clear reason why."
882,"“If you say you’re waiting until the next meeting because you want to see some data between now and the next meeting, that makes markets wonder ‘OK, well, what is it that could derail a rate cut between now and the next meeting?’,” Former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg Television."
883,"“If you do react to that data, that’s kind of data-point dependent.”
 To Thierry Wizman at Macquarie, the Fed will need to “thread a needle.”
 “A too-strong signal of a coming September rate cut may scare traders into thinking that the Fed sees abrupt economic weakness ahead,” he noted."
884,"“A too-weak signal, where a rate cut hinges on the data ‘evolving as we expect’ in the context of lingering attentiveness to inflation may not sound satisfactory to the bulls.”
 The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%."
885,A Bloomberg gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps jumped 3%.
886,The $22 billion VanEck Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SMH) climbed 6%.
887,The Russell 2000 of small firms added 1%.

 The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.5%."
893,"Oil jumped after Hamas said Israel killed its political leader, stoking geopolitical risks."
894,The yen rallied as the Bank of Japan raised interest rates and announced plans to cut bond purchases.
895,"Fed officials are likely to move closer to lowering rates from a two-decade high by signaling a potential rate cut in September, though they may stop short of providing details beyond that."
896,The decision will be announced via a post-meeting statement at 2 p.m. in Washington.
897,Jerome Powell will hold a press conference 30 minutes later.
898,"Powell’s press conference is the usual “wild card,” according to Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
 “While risks are skewed that Powell leans dovish, we do not expect him to validate the aggressive easing that’s priced in by the markets,” they noted."
899,A survey conducted by 22V Research shows 75% of investors believe that officials will first cut because of a soft landing and that inflation is on a Fed-friendly path toward sub-3%.
900,So there will be a cut because policy doesn’t need to be as restrictive.
901,“This is 11% higher than when we asked last month.
902,"Investor confidence around a soft-landing is increasing,” said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V."
903,"In addition, 44% of the investors polled by 22V expect the Fed meeting/presser to be “mixed/negligible,” 38% believe “risk-on” and 18% “risk-off.”
 In economic news, a broad gauge of US labor cost growth closely watched by the Fed cooled in the second quarter by more than forecast."
904,American companies added the fewest number of workers since the start of the year and wage growth slowed.
905,"Separately, pending home sales rose for the first time in three months."
906,"“The Fed could justify a rate cut today based on current data on the job market and inflation, as well as the plausible case for both to cool in the near term,” said Bill Adams at Comerica Bank."
907,"“But the Fed is also concerned about their credibility, which they fear may have been dented by inflation’s overshoot in the last three years.”
 The road ahead for investors is looking rough right now as policy gatherings by the world’s most important central banks come at the start of what’s historically the worst two months for US stock returns."
908,"In the past three decades, the S&P 500 in August and September has averaged respective losses of 0.5% and 0.7%, data compiled by Bloomberg show."
909,Those seasonal patterns create another headache for traders since the broadening of this year’s powerful stock-market rally hangs on what the Fed signals about interest rates once its two-day meeting wraps up this afternoon.
910,"“We continue to see a favorable backdrop for US equities and advise investors to maintain a full allocation to the US market,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management."
911,"“We believe AI beneficiaries should continue to account for a substantial part of portfolios as the technology drives further growth in the years ahead, but we also see opportunities in other quality companies, including those exposed to secular trends like the energy transition, blue economy, and water scarcity.”

 The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months."
1271,"Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months."
1272,The move would pave the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
1273,"While the central bank said it will continue to hold rates at current levels, Fed officials are now wary of any risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement."
1274,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked up inflation’s recent progress in his post-meeting news conference, saying “the second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.” He also conveyed that since the job market seems to be back to a pre-pandemic normal, any additional cooling could be concerning for the Fed."
1275,The Fed’s latest policy statement also suggested that officials view inflation as less of an issue now than at their June meeting.
1276,"This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs."
1277,"Powell doubled down on his point that determining when to cut rates will be “a very difficult judgement call.” There are consequences both if the Fed cuts too soon, and if it cuts too late."
1278,"Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged."
1279,"That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point."
1280,"In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment."
1281,"Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest meeting, news conference and policy statement."
1282,"Powell cheers inflation’s slowdown and the economy’s resilience
 It’s crucial for the Fed’s top policymaker to sound confident about inflation before the central bank can begin cutting interest rates, and confident he sounded."
1283,"Powell said “inflation has eased notably over the past few years, but remains somewhat elevated from our longer run goal of 2%.” The Fed’s statement also described inflation as “somewhat” elevated, which wasn’t a word that had been used before to describe inflation since the Fed began to lift rates in early 2022."
1284,"The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target."
1285,"The Fed is still very much wary about inflation, but a bit less so now."
1286,"Powell even said that “we don’t need to be 100% focused on inflation.” Indeed, the second quarter really gave Fed officials a huge relief."
1287,"That wasn’t just because inflation resumed a downward trend, but also because economic growth remained solid."
1288,"The government’s latest report on gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions."
1289,Powell called that a “historically unusual” development.
1290,"“This is such a welcome outcome for the people we serve,” Powell said."
1291,"“What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?"
1292,"And this is part of that.”
 All eyes on America’s job market
 The future of the job market is now top of mind for the Fed."
1293,"Employers aren’t hiring at the same pace they have in recent years, it’s become a lot tougher for unemployed Americans to find a new job, demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%."
1294,The Fed is responsible for keeping the labor market intact.
1295,"Powell described that slower momentum as an “ongoing gradual normalization,” considering the job market was once running red-hot after it rebounded mightily from the pandemic-induced recession in 2020."
1296,"But he noted that any significant weakening would be concerning since the job market is “back to where it was on the eve of the pandemic,” he said."
1297,"“I wouldn’t say we don’t want to see any other cooling; it would have to be a material difference: If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to,” he said."
1298,"“I think we’re in a good place here.”
 The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US job market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday."
1299,"A highly unusual economic cycle
 It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist."
1300,"The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom."
1301,"Powell said it’s highly unclear how the economy will unfold, adding that effects from the Covid-19 pandemic have undermined conventional wisdom, but he said “history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
 Plus, it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy."
1302,"For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart."
1303,"Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences."
1304,"In theory, American shoppers should be tapping out soon, which could spell trouble for the job market."
1305,"However, last year, the economy’s sheer resilience shocked economists who widely expected a recession, which never happened."
1306,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that greater progress has been made in reducing inflation to its 2% target, a sign that the central bank is moving closer toward cutting its key interest rate for the first time in four years."
1307,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that greater progress has been made in reducing inflation to its 2% target, a sign that the central bank is moving closer toward cutting its key interest rate for the first time in four years."
1308,"In a statement issued after it concluded its two-day meeting, the Fed also said that “job gains have moderated” and acknowledged that the unemployment rate has risen."
1309,"The Fed is required by Congress to pursue stable prices and maximum employment, and the statement said the central bank is “attentive to the risks” to both goals, a shift after several years of focusing exclusively on combatting inflation."
1310,"Fed policymakers also chose to keep their key rate at a 23-year high of 5.3%, even as many Democratic elected officials and some economists have pushed for lower rates to bolster the economy and prevent job cuts."
1311,"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have argued that a rate cut before the election would appear politically motivated."
1312,"Before the Fed's decision, financial market traders had priced in 100% odds that the central bank will reduce its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to futures markets."
1313,The Fed typically seeks to avoid surprising investors with its rate decisions.
1314,"The Fed is seeking to strike a delicate balance: It wants to keep rates high enough for long enough to quell inflation, which has fallen to 2.5% from a peak two years ago of 7.1%, according to its preferred measure."
1315,But it also wants to avoid keeping borrowing costs so high that it triggers a recession.
1316,"So far, it is on track for a so-called “soft landing,” in which inflation falls to 2% without a recession."
1317,"Yet with the unemployment rate ticking higher for three months in a row, some economists have raised concerns that the Fed should have cut rates Wednesday or should cut them more quickly later this year."
1318,"“The finish line is in sight and it would be tragic for the Fed to stumble and fall, with one-tenth of a mile left in the marathon, which is what I think they would be doing if they don’t start cutting,” Bharat Ramamurti, an advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project and former economist in the Biden White House, said on a call with reporters."
1319,"Also Wednesday, three Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, urged Chair Jerome Powell in a letter to cut rates."
1320,The letter charged that a failure to reduce borrowing costs soon would suggest the Fed is “giving in to bullying” and would itself be a political move.
1321,"In the latest piece of good news on price increases, last Friday the government said that yearly inflation fell to 2.5% in July, according to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure."
1322,"That is down from 2.6% the previous month and the lowest since February 2021, when inflation was just starting to accelerate."
1323,"At the same time, the unemployment rate has risen by nearly a half-percentage point this year to a still-low 4.1% and hiring has slowed."
1324,"Powell and other Fed officials have highlighted they are increasingly focused on the risk that the job market could falter, another reason markets expect rate cuts soon."
1325,"The government will issue the latest jobs numbers this Friday, and economists forecast that it will say employers added 175,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained 4.1%."

1503,"It will be important to see “the totality of data (jobs and inflation), the evolving outlook and the balance of risks or consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labour market”, he added."
1504,"“If that test is met, the reduction of policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell added while hinting at a rate cut in September."
1505,The next US Fed’s FOMC meeting will take place on September 17-18.
1506,"The last interest rate cut in the US took place on March 15, 2020."

1508,"On future rate decisions, it said that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC “will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks”."
1509,"On inflation, the US central bank said it “has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated”."
1510,"In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee’s 2 per cent inflation objective."
1511,The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.
1512,The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.
1513,"The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
1514,The US central bank has been holding the interest rates for the past one year since July 2023.
1515,"Before that, between March 2022 and July 2023, the US Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by 525 basis points to control inflation, which hit a multi-decade high amid the Ukraine-Russia war and COVID restrictions."
1516,A basis point is 100th of a percentage point.
1517,"However, now, the retail inflation in the US has fallen steadily closer to the Fed’s 2% target for the past several months."
1518,"According to the latest data, yearly inflation in the US fell to 2.5% in July."
1519,The separate latest data showed that the US economy also grew faster than expected at 2.8 per cent in the second quarter solid gains in consumer spending and business investment.
1520,The Q2 GDP growth was double the 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter.
1521,"What Does It Mean for the Indian Markets, Gold Prices?"
1522,The status quo by the US Federal Reserve has already been factored in by the markets.
1523,"However, the possibility of a rate cut in September will have a positive impact on the Indian market, which has been hovering near the magical 25,000 on Nifty for the last few days."
1524,"The possibility of a rate cut in September will cause gold and equity prices to rise, said Amit Goel, co-founder & chief global strategist, Pace 360."

1531,It’s Fed day — which looms over a busy period for earnings and a heavy newsflow that just won’t let up.
1532,"The central bank isn’t expected to lower rates Wednesday, despite calls from some former policymakers."
1533,"Even if officials generally believe rates should be lower, they could spook the market by moving suddenly."
1534,"If they wait, they need to have a clear reason why."
1535,"“If you say you’re waiting until the next meeting because you want to see some data between now and the next meeting, that makes markets wonder ‘OK, well, what is it that could derail a rate cut between now and the next meeting?’,” Former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg Television."
1536,"“If you do react to that data, that’s kind of data-point dependent.”
 To Thierry Wizman at Macquarie, the Fed will need to “thread a needle.”
 “A too-strong signal of a coming September rate cut may scare traders into thinking that the Fed sees abrupt economic weakness ahead,” he noted."
1537,"“A too-weak signal, where a rate cut hinges on the data ‘evolving as we expect’ in the context of lingering attentiveness to inflation may not sound satisfactory to the bulls.”
 The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%."
1538,A Bloomberg gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps jumped 3%.
1539,The $22 billion VanEck Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SMH) climbed 6%.

1921,"Now that inflation is cooling again, officials may be more open to two cuts before 2024 is over."
1922,"The Fed will announce its policy decision Wednesday at 2 pm ET, followed by Chair Powell’s press conference at 2:30 pm ET."

1924,"Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months."
1925,The move would pave the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
1926,"While the central bank said it will continue to hold rates at current levels, Fed officials are now wary of any risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement."
1927,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked up inflation’s recent progress in his post-meeting news conference, saying “the second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.” He also conveyed that since the job market seems to be back to a pre-pandemic normal, any additional cooling could be concerning for the Fed."
1928,The Fed’s latest policy statement also suggested that officials view inflation as less of an issue now than at their June meeting.
1929,"This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs."
1930,"Powell doubled down on his point that determining when to cut rates will be “a very difficult judgement call.” There are consequences both if the Fed cuts too soon, and if it cuts too late."
1931,"Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged."
1932,"That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point."
1933,"In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment."
1934,"Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest meeting, news conference and policy statement."
1935,"Powell cheers inflation’s slowdown and the economy’s resilience
 It’s crucial for the Fed’s top policymaker to sound confident about inflation before the central bank can begin cutting interest rates, and confident he sounded."
1936,"Powell said “inflation has eased notably over the past few years, but remains somewhat elevated from our longer run goal of 2%.” The Fed’s statement also described inflation as “somewhat” elevated, which wasn’t a word that had been used before to describe inflation since the Fed began to lift rates in early 2022."
1937,"The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target."
1938,"The Fed is still very much wary about inflation, but a bit less so now."
1939,"Powell even said that “we don’t need to be 100% focused on inflation.” Indeed, the second quarter really gave Fed officials a huge relief."
1940,"That wasn’t just because inflation resumed a downward trend, but also because economic growth remained solid."
1941,"The government’s latest report on gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions."
1942,Powell called that a “historically unusual” development.
1943,"“This is such a welcome outcome for the people we serve,” Powell said."
1944,"“What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?"
1945,"And this is part of that.”
 All eyes on America’s job market
 The future of the job market is now top of mind for the Fed."
1946,"Employers aren’t hiring at the same pace they have in recent years, it’s become a lot tougher for unemployed Americans to find a new job, demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%."
1947,The Fed is responsible for keeping the labor market intact.
1948,"Powell described that slower momentum as an “ongoing gradual normalization,” considering the job market was once running red-hot after it rebounded mightily from the pandemic-induced recession in 2020."
1949,"But he noted that any significant weakening would be concerning since the job market is “back to where it was on the eve of the pandemic,” he said."
1950,"“I wouldn’t say we don’t want to see any other cooling; it would have to be a material difference: If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to,” he said."
1951,"“I think we’re in a good place here.”
 The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US job market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday."
1952,"A highly unusual economic cycle
 It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist."
1953,"The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom."
1954,"Powell said it’s highly unclear how the economy will unfold, adding that effects from the Covid-19 pandemic have undermined conventional wisdom, but he said “history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
 Plus, it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy."
1955,"For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart."
1956,"Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences."
1957,"In theory, American shoppers should be tapping out soon, which could spell trouble for the job market."
1958,"However, last year, the economy’s sheer resilience shocked economists who widely expected a recession, which never happened."
