 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the 
 U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment 
 and price stability goals."
1,"With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic 
 activity and employment have continued to strengthen."
2,"The sectors most adversely 
 affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer’s rise in 
 COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery."
3,"Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting 
 factors that are expected to be transitory."
4,"Supply and demand imbalances related to 
 the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price 
 increases in some sectors."
5,"Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in 
 part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. 
 households and businesses."
6,The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus.
7,"Progress 
 on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued 
 gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation."
8,"Risks 
 to the economic outlook remain."
9,"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate 
 of 2 percent over the longer run."
10,"With inflation having run persistently below this 
 longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 
 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term 
 inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent."
11,"The Committee expects to 
 maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are 
 achieved."
12,"The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate

 at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until 
 labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s 
 assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on 
 track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."
13,"In light of the substantial further 
 progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, 
 the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases 
 by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed 
 securities."
14,"Beginning later this month, the Committee will increase its holdings of 
 Treasury securities by at least $70 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed 
 securities by at least $35 billion per month."
15,"Beginning in December, the Committee 
 will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $60 billion per month and 
 of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $30 billion per month."
16,"The 
 Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely 
 be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if 
 warranted by changes in the economic outlook."
17,"The Federal Reserve’s ongoing 
 purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market 
 functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of 
 credit to households and businesses."
18,"In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will 
 continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic 
 outlook."
19,"The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy 
 as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s 
 goals."
20,"The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of 
 information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation 
 pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments."
