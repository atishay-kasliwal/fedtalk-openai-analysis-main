0,The Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady and Is Not Quite Ready to Cut Them.,2024-01-31T17:03:15Z,"Federal Reserve officials, seeking more progress on the fight against inflation, hinted that their next move will be a cut in interest rates — just not yet.","Federal Reserve officials held interest rates at their highest level in more than two decades at their first meeting of 2024 and hinted that their next move will be to lower borrowing costs — even as policymakers made clear they are not yet ready to make that cut.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chair, said that the country had “six good months” of moderating inflation, but officials wanted to see continued progress before lowering rates.
“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Mr. Powell said. He added that when it comes to gaining enough confidence to move borrowing costs lower, “we want to see more good data.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/business/what-to-watch-at-the-fed-meeting-today.html

7,Federal Reserve expected to hold rates steady as consumer confidence improves,2024-01-31T14:38:12Z,The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at their current levels on Wednesday amid improving consumer confidence and a declining inflation rate.,"The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at their current levels on Wednesday amid improving consumer confidence and a declining inflation rate.
At 2 p.m. ET, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to announce its decision, which could see the federal funds rate left unchanged at 5.33%.
In the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, some Fed officials have been signaling that the current rate has been enough to knock inflation down toward the central bank's 2% target.
The federal funds target rate has remained at 5.25% to 5.5% since last summer, following 11 increases that began in March 2022. The rate sets a benchmark for other interest rates throughout the economy — everything from credit cards to mortgages, and business and auto loans.
Some economists believe these higher rates have helped pull down inflation.
In December, the main measure of consumer-focused inflation, the 12-month consumer price index, came in at at 3.3% — little changed from the previous month's 3.1% measurement.
And the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, came in even lower, at 2.6%.
In remarks this month, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that slowing inflation, combined with continued steady employment gains had led to an economic landscape that was “almost as good as it gets.”
“The progress I have noted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2%,” he said in written remarks to the Brookings Institution, according to The Associated Press.
Meanwhile, two gauges of consumer confidence show that Americans are starting to feel more upbeat about the economy. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index reached a two-year high on what the business group said was ""surging views of current conditions"" and ""declining pessimism about [the] future.""
That followed a reading earlier this month from the University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey that reached its highest level since 2021.
Yet, there are already some signals that post-pandemic economic growth has peaked. On Tuesday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that fewer Americans quit their jobs last year compared with 2022, while the seasonally adjusted level in December fell to the lowest monthly level in nearly three years.
Economists believe that workers are more inclined to leave their jobs if they believe a better opportunity awaits them.
""On balance, the different labor market indicators show that the labor market is holding up well, but there are signs of weakness such as lower hiring rates and rising unemployment rate,"" analysts with Citibank said in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We will continue to watch jobless claims data as one of the more timely indicators for the labor market.""
At 3.7%, the unemployment rate is now back to pre-pandemic levels, though it has crept higher from the post-pandemic low of 3.4% seen in January 2023. The four-month moving average of weekly initial jobless claims has not seen a meaningful increase in the entire post-pandemic era.
But January has seen a slew of layoff announcements, especially in more white-collar industries such as tech and media.
""Increasing reports of localized layoffs confirm that labor market conditions are not as strong as they were a year ago and that some pockets of weakness have emerged,"" Lydia Boussour, senior economist at the consulting firm EY, said in a note to clients Tuesday.
Still, traders believe the economy remains strong enough that they have estimated the probability of the Fed's first rate cut happening in March at 61.5% — down from a 73% likelihood a month ago. If the Fed does indeed reduce interest rates in March, it will have been two years since it first began raising them to fight inflation.
Not everyone is that optimistic about an imminent rate cut.
""We think markets are overly optimistic that we’ll see a Fed interest rate cut in March,"" Vanguard chief global economist Joe Davis said in a note to clients Tuesday.
""It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-january-2024-increase-decrease-rcna136429
8,"Stock market today: Nasdaq sinks after early Big Tech bust, with Fed on deck",2024-01-31T14:36:54Z,The Federal Reserve takes center stage while Wall Street evaluates any lingering impact from the first batch of tech earnings.,"US stocks turned mostly lower Wednesday, with the Nasdaq falling more than 1% at the open after the first batch of results from tech giants largely failed to satisfy investors. Wall Street was also bracing for the Federal Reserve's first interest rate decision of the year.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 1.1% early Wednesday. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) traded about 0.5% lower after slumping slightly below its record high on Tuesday. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), meanwhile, ticked slightly above the flatline.
""Magnificent Seven"" names Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with chipmaker AMD (AMD), took center stage on the earnings docket Tuesday. All three stocks were hit Wednesday, with over 5% drops from the Google parent and AMD outpacing Microsoft's modest decline.
The poor start from the tech mega-caps, which are expected to do much of the heavy lifting for the S&P 500 this earnings season, could unnerve Wall Street — at least until Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) get their turn on Thursday.
Or until Wednesday afternoon, when the Fed gets its turn in the spotlight in a busy week. The Fed is largely expected to hold interest rates steady at multi-decade highs, but investors are turning their attention to any signs of when — and how much — the central bank will turn to rate cuts, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports.
Boeing (BA) was the highlight of the Wednesday morning earnings docket amid a string of safety concerns related to its planes. The company beat Wall Street's expectations for the fourth quarter but the plane maker suspended its 2024 guidance.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-nasdaq-sinks-after-early-big-tech-bust-with-fed-on-deck-124311469.html

Compensation as measured by the government's Employment Cost Index rose 0.9% in the October-December quarter, down from a 1.1% increase in the previous quarter, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, compensation growth slowed to 4.2% from 4.3%.
The increase in wages and benefits was still mostly healthy, but the slowdown could contribute to the cooling of inflation and will likely be welcomed by Federal Reserve policymakers. The Fed is expected to keep its key short-term rate unchanged after its latest policy meeting concludes Wednesday. It may signal, however, that it’s getting closer to cutting its rate later this year.
“Not great news for our pay checks, but good news for inflation and the prospect of meaningful"" interest rate cuts by the Fed, said James Knightley, chief international economist for European bank ING.
While Fed officials have signaled they will lower their benchmark rate this year, they haven't signaled when they will begin, a decision eagerly awaited by Wall Street investors and many businesses. The slowing wage gains could make the Fed more comfortable cutting its rate as early as March, economists said. Still, most analysts expect the first cut will occure in May or June.
When the Fed reduces its rate, it typically lowers the cost of mortgages, auto loans, credit card rates and business borrowing.
The pace of worker compensation plays a big role in businesses’ labor costs. When pay accelerates especially fast, it increases the labor costs of companies, which often respond by raising their prices. This cycle can perpetuate inflation, which the Fed is assessing in deciding when to adjust its influential benchmark rate.
Since the pandemic, wages on average have grown at a historically rapid pace, before adjusting for inflation. Many companies have had to offer much higher pay to attract and keep workers. Yet hiring has moderated in recent months, to levels closer those that prevailed before the pandemic. The more modest job gains have reduced pressure on companies to offer big pay gains.
The Federal Reserve considers the ECI one of the most important gauges of wages and benefits because it measures how pay changes for the same sample of jobs. Other measures, such as average hourly pay, can be artificially boosted as a result of, say, widespread layoffs among lower-paid workers.
Even as wage increases slow, inflation has fallen further, leaving Americans with better pay gains after adjusting for rising prices. After taking inflation into account, pay rose 0.9% in last year's fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, up from a 0.6% annual gain in the previous quarter.
Growth in pay and benefits, as measured by the ECI, peaked at 5.1% in the fall of 2022. Yet at that time, inflation was rising much faster than it is now, thereby reducing Americans’ overall buying power. The Fed’s goal is to slow inflation so that even smaller pay increases can result in inflation-adjusted income gains.

Fed Gov. Waller: 'As Good As It Gets'
The best guide to Fed policy in recent months has been the comments of Fed Gov. Christopher Waller, who had been a fixture of the hawkish consensus until late last year. Odds of one last Fed rate hike collapsed in mid-October after Waller and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield was doing the Fed's work for it by tightening financial markets.
Then, on Nov. 28, in a speech titled ""Something Appears To Be Giving,"" Waller said that rate cuts would be warranted if inflation continued to ease over the next three to five months. That pretty much cemented the outlook for a rate cut by the May 1 Fed meeting.
Waller continued to toe a dovish line with his Jan. 16 speech, ""Almost as Good as It Gets ... But Will It Last?""
""The data we have received the last few months is allowing the Committee to consider cutting the policy rate in 2024,"" Waller said at the time.
Yet Waller's seemingly dovish pronouncement was premised on his expectation that Q4 GDP growth would come in between 1% and 2% — not the 3.3% rate reported on Jan. 25.
Even if growth had moderated, Waller indicated changes in Fed policy needed to be ""carefully calibrated and not rushed."" But with the GDP report and surging S&P 500 casting doubt on whether an economic moderation is at hand, the Fed may not see a need to begin lowering its key rate.
The Real Fed Policy Rate
Actually, the economy is displaying a near-ideal combination of strong growth and falling inflation. In the second half of 2023, real GDP grew at a 4.1% pace, as the Fed's primary measure of core inflation ran at just a 2% rate — in line with the Fed's target. That brought the 12-month core inflation rate down to 3.15% from 4.6% midyear.
That means the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate, now set between 5.25% and 5.5% is at about 2.2 percentage points above the rate of inflation and that gap could grow to more than 3 percentage points if the tame recent inflation trend continues.
The upshot is that Fed policy is growing very tight in real terms. Keep in mind that the Fed's quarterly projections in December showed that policymakers think the neutral federal funds rate, one that neither accelerates nor slows economic growth, is just 0.5%.
That implies the Fed has plenty of room to cut interest rates, and it explains why markets expect five or six quarter-point rate cuts this year.
What Will Powell Say?
Powell helped light a fire under the S&P 500 on Dec. 13 when he said that the Fed is very cognizant of the risk of keeping policy tight for too long. That eased any remaining concern about a recession caused by Fed overtightening.
But with the economy still showing strength and the S&P 500 rallying to new heights — and possibly in the early stages of a 1990s-like boom led by artificial intelligence stocks — Powell will likely strike a more cautious tone.
Markets could react if he delves into the question of whether strong economic growth despite a high federal funds rate may mean that the neutral Fed policy rate is higher than believed. If the real federal funds rate is significantly higher than 0.5%, it might suggest that the 10-year Treasury yield may be stuck above 4%.
Powell also is likely to discuss coming changes to Fed quantitative tightening, the shrinking of its balance sheet as Treasuries and government-backed mortgage securities purchased early in the pandemic emergency mature. That's something Wall Street is eager to hear about. But that probably won't provide the S&P 500 a spark today.
Deutsche Bank economists wrote this week that they expect the Fed's discussion over QT to extend for a couple of meetings. They expect a tapering of balance-sheet runoff to happen in June, but for the unloading of assets to continue at a more moderate pace, rather than phaseout, at least initially.
Fed Rate Cut Odds
As of Wednesday morning, markets are pricing in 49.6% odds of a rate cut on March 20 and 89% odds of a cut by May 1.
S&P 500
S&P 500 futures slipped 0.5% in early Wednesday stock market action after earnings reports from Google and Microsoft on Tuesday afternoon.
The slightly negative tone may make markets less likely to shake off any dissonant message from Fed chair Powell. However, markets may get a lift from release of the Fed policy statement at 2 p.m., since it's likely to adopt a balanced posture, ditching its prior tightening bias as a possible prelude to rate cuts.

TSX Today: What to Watch for in Stocks on Wednesday, January 31
An intraday strength in most commodity prices helped the Canadian stock market notch its fourth consecutive winning day, taking it to new heights in over one-and-a-half years. Despite the release of mixed economic data from the United States, the S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 28 points on Tuesday to settle at 21,228.
On the one hand, sectors like healthcare, technology, and real estate stock weakness ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. On the other hand, strong gains in energy and industrial stocks kept the optimism alive, helping the TSX benchmark end another session in green territory.
Top TSX Composite movers and active stocks
Filo, New Gold, Orla Mining, and MEG Energy were the top-performing TSX stocks yesterday, as they inched up by more than 5% each.
On the flip side, shares of Ballard Power Systems, NovaGold Resources, BRP, and BlackBerry dived by at least 4% each, making them the day’s bottom performers on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Metro (TSX:MRU) also trended downward after announcing its quarterly financial results. In the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended in December), the Montréal-based food and pharmacy retailer’s total revenue rose 6.5% year over year to $4.97 billion. Last quarter, its same-store sales for food and pharmacy segments increased by 6.1% and 3.9%, respectively.
With this, Metro posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.02 per share, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $0.99 per share. In its latest earnings report, however, the company also warned investors that it’s facing “significant headwinds” in the fiscal year 2024 with modest growth due to new automation investments but remains optimistic about long-term growth. This warning could be the main reason why MRU stock fell 1.6% in the last session to $70.10 per share, despite its quarterly earnings beat.

Jan. 31 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve Board will deliver its first policy decision on interest rates in 2024 amid weakening inflation and a strengthening economy, while Wall Street expected the central bank to leave the current rate unchanged. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will make his customary announcement at 2:30 p.m. EST following a two-day meeting of monetary policymakers on whether interest will be raised, lowered or maintained in the near term.

The interest rate decision comes amid improving inflation in the United States, reflected in a 0.2% rise in the personal consumption expenditures price index since December, and a 2.9% increase over the past year -- the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation.
In remarks, Powell will provide details about the latest interest rate decision, as well as the central bank's outlook for the coming months.

Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to hold rates steady, between 5.25% and 5.5%, as it did during the last policy meeting in December, and to delay the first interest cut of the year until at least March, according to CBS News, citing financial data provider FactSet.
Many economists expected the Fed to wait even longer to cut rates, possibly until May, as the central bank was wary about inflation regaining steam if it moved too hastily to lower interest.
As a result, the Fed was likely to avoid making any decisive move on interest during Wednesday's announcement.
""The Fed is being very cautious as it navigates the potential for future rate cuts,"" LendingTree economist Jacob Channel told CBS. ""While it doesn't want to leave rates high forever, it also doesn't want to cut them prematurely and risk inflation spiking again.""
The Fed issued 11 consecutive benchmark rate increases with the goal of bringing inflation down to 2%.
But in the latter half of 2023, the nation's central bank began keeping interest rates unchanged to sustain the economy's upward trajectory.
At the last policy meeting, the Fed indicated that it might start slashing interest rates again after the new year as inflation had dipped to about 3.7% toward the end of 2023.

However, Powell said it was too soon to say when the reductions might occur, warning that any speculation about the timing of interest rate cuts was premature.
""It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease,"" Powell said on Dec. 1.
""We have made considerable progress in reducing high inflation while maintaining a strong labor market,"" he continued. ""The Federal Open Market Committee is strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2% over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.""
Economists are now hopeful for the first interest rate cut in more than two years, while some predict the Fed could potentially issue five reductions throughout 2024 -- bringing relief to borrowers who have struggled to pay off high-interest mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.
Meanwhile, 10-year Treasury yields declined Wednesday to 4.0241%, while the 2-year Treasury yield was more than three points lower at 4.3221%, according to CNBC.
This follows a post-pandemic boom on the bond note that electrified Wall Street in 2023.

Here’s what might,2024-01-31T13:08:19Z,"The Federal Reserve makes its first interest rate decision of the year on Wednesday but with practically all of Wall Street in agreement that no changes will be made, investors are focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s afternoon press conference where he’ll answer questions about his outlook for monetary policy.","A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

New York CNN —
The Federal Reserve makes its first interest rate decision of the year on Wednesday. But with practically all of Wall Street in agreement that no changes will be made, investors are focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s afternoon press conference where he’ll answer questions about his outlook for monetary policy.
And if past performance is any indicator of future results, there’s a lot resting on Powell’s guidance. We can guess what might happen: If he hints that cuts are coming, markets will likely respond with glee. If he suggests that interest rates will stay higher for longer, we can expect stocks to sink.
But analysts say that Powell isn’t as influential as we’ve been led to believe.
Researchers at Bespoke Investment Group mapped the performance of the S&P 500 index against the probability of a rate cut at the March meeting and found the two aren’t very correlated.
The odds that the central bank cuts rates in March, based on federal funds futures, have halved since late December. But over that same period, the S&P 500 has risen by more than 3.5%.
That might be because inflation rates are once again approaching the Fed’s target of 2%.
“Once inflation gets down below 5%, it disappears from the headlines,” Johns Hopkins economist and central bank scholar Laurence Ball previously told Before the Bell. “People go back to worrying about budget deficits or climate change or other public issues there are.”
The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index — the inflation gauge that the Fed uses as its target rate — was up 2.6% annually in December, closing out 2023 with a far softer punch than the 5.4% gain a year prior, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. December’s inflation reading was just 0.6 percentage points from the central bank’s goal of 2%.
At this point in the cycle, Fed decisions mean very little for the market’s trajectory, said Kevin Gordon, a strategist at Charles Schwab, in a note to investors on Tuesday.
Gordon tracked the market back to the early 1900s and found that on average, the S&P 500 went up by 2% in the periods between the Fed’s last rate hike and the first cut. However, that average doesn’t tell the full story because markets have swung wildly, between 27% lower and 26% higher, during those periods — ending higher only 50% of the time.
When inflation eases, investors turn their attention to other pressing matters. There are plenty of those right now: conflict in the Middle East and Europe, rising trade tensions between the US and China, and China’s slowing economy, for example.
But traders are also focused on the resilience of the US economy through all of it. Unemployment remains low, and US job openings grew in December. The US economy, as measured by gross domestic product, is stronger than expected, and consumers continue to spend.
“The Fed’s next decision should not be the centerpiece of anyone’s investing thesis,” said Gordon.
There’s a lot to take in, and studying TV subtitles as Jay Powell speaks Wednesday might not be Wall Street’s best use of time.
Tensions around the Red Sea could lead inflation higher
The drone strike that killed three US service members and injured dozens in Jordan has increased fears on Wall Street of escalating war in the Middle East.
The Sunday attack was the first time American troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the beginning of the Gaza war in October. Asked by CNN’s Arlette Saenz whether he has decided how to respond, US President Joe Biden said, “Yes,” but declined to provide further details.
Markets have so far mostly shrugged off worries about more fighting, but oil prices have edge up as Americans brace for the US response to the attacks.
West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, gained $1.04, or 1.35% on Tuesday, settling at $77.82 a barrel. Brent, meanwhile, rose 47 cents, or 0.57%, and finished the day at $82.87.
Conflict in the Middle East and the Red Sea in particular “poses a risk to global trade,” said EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour on Tuesday.
Many cargo ships are now avoiding the Suez Canal because of repeated attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. That’s a huge blow to trade: As much as 15% of global trade and 25%-30% of global container shipments transit through the waterway.
That increases the chance of inflation pressure as shipping costs surge, a risk the International Monetary Fund also highlighted in its World Economic Outlook Tuesday.
“For now, we don’t expect the situation in the Red Sea to substantially alter the outlook for global inflation and global monetary policy this year,” said Boussour. “However, a prolonged conflict with shipping costs staying as high through 2024 could add up to 0.7 percentage points to global inflation this year.”
Microsoft profits climb 33% as AI business thrives
Microsoft recently became only the second company ever worth $3 trillion as the artificial intelligence boom sent shares of the company’s stock soaring.
On Tuesday afternoon, the company reported fourth quarter earnings that contained further fodder for bullish investors.
Net profit for the final quarter of the year grew by 33%, the company reported, largely due to its investments in the artificial intelligence sector.
The company reported earnings per share of $2.93, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.79. Revenue was up 18% from last year at just over $62 billion.
“We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”

27,"With the economy looking bright enough, the Federal Reserve seems content to play the waiting game",2024-01-31T13:00:00Z,"The central bank is ‘really in risk management mode,‘ its chairman said.","If there’s one thing you can say about Fed policymakers, it’s that they don’t make decisions on a whim. When the Federal Open Market Committee met on Jan. 31, 2024, it held interest rates steady – as most observers expected. That marks six months since the Fed last changed the base rate.
And people should expect to wait a little while more: Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a rate cut was “not likely” to come at the next meeting in March. But over the course of his news conference after the meeting, he emphasized that nothing is set in stone.
The Federal Reserve has what is called a dual mandate: Its job is to achieve maximum employment and keep prices stable. Often there’s a trade-off between these goals: Cutting rates often helps with the former, while lowering them helps with the latter.
And in recent months, controlling inflation has been the focus of Fed policy. In his remarks on Jan. 31, Powell made it clear that Americans shouldn’t expect the Fed to do anything to rates until the U.S. gets closer to its target of 2% inflation. And that could take some time.
There’s a reason Powell and his fellow policymakers are focused on the 2% inflation target. So long as consumer price index inflation is above 2%, the concern is that any lowering of interest rates could stimulate the economy too much and reignite inflation.
Still, the federal funds rate, which helps determine mortgage and loan rates and quite a bit more, remains at 5.5%, higher than it’s been in 16 years. The Fed has raised rates 11 times since early 2022.
That aggressive rate-hiking has had the desired effect of putting the brakes on the economy. But it comes with some pain for borrowers – and some are now eager to bring rates back down.
Cutting rates usually makes sense when the economy is getting significantly worse, and there’s not much reason to think that’s happening now. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew 3.3% on an annualized basis, ending 2023 on a strong note. The economy added more than 2 million jobs over the course of 2023. And consumer price index inflation is running at about 3.3% in December 2023.
“This is a good situation,” Powell said during his news conference. “Let’s be honest: This is a good economy.”
So what comes next? The Fed recently indicated that it expects to cut rates three times in 2024. But as Powell was at pains to make clear, if the data changes, the Fed’s decision-making will, too.
The labor market data looks relatively sunny. There’s greater balance between the number of people who want jobs and the number of open positions than there was last year. Wage growth looks likely to continue at current rates. So unless there’s a sharp increase in unemployment, which doesn’t seem likely at the moment, there seems to be little reason to cut interest rates.
There’s always a concern that keeping rates too high for too long may tip the economy into a recession. But recent history doesn’t suggest that will happen.
Taking the long view
Taking a historical perspective can be revealing. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is about 6.6% – high by recent standards. However, back in 1998, the year I bought my first home, the rate was 6.9%. At that time, it was a real deal!
Mortgage rates have been as high as 18% if you go back to 1981. That’s not to say either I or the Fed believe there’s room to increase rates any time soon – just that rates are nowhere near record highs.
Powell did say there’s no reason for any rate increases, so the current Federal funds rate of 5.5% is likely the current cyclical peak.
The next meeting will start March 19. The odds are that the U.S. economy will continue to grow, and inflation will continue to moderate – however slowly. So I would expect the Fed to follow through on Powell’s noncommittal prediction and hold off on cutting rates until later in the year.
So there’s no soft landing yet – Powell said as much. But we look surprisingly close.",https://theconversation.com/with-the-economy-looking-bright-enough-the-federal-reserve-seems-content-to-play-the-waiting-game-222460
28,U.S. Federal Reserve likely to show little urgency to cut interest rates despite market’s anticipation,2024-01-31T11:48:29Z,Fed officials are likely to signal on Wednesday that they will wait until they’re confident that inflation is reliably moving to their 2% target before cutting rates,"Open this photo in gallery: The Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on Jan. 26, 2022.JOSHUA ROBERTS/Reuters
The Federal Reserve will likely move closer Wednesday to cutting its key interest rate after nearly two years of hikes that were intended to fight the worst inflation in decades. Yet it may not provide much of a hint about when – or how fast – it will do so.
Though Fed officials are expected to cut rates within the next few months, they’ll likely signal Wednesday that they expect to wait until they’re confident that inflation, which has tumbled from its peak, is reliably moving to their 2 per cent target. The central bank’s benchmark rate influences the cost of most consumer and business loans, and companies, investors and individuals have been eager for the central bank to ease the cost of borrowing.
The Fed is assessing the economy at a time when the intensifying presidential race is pivoting in no small part on voters’ perceptions of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship. Republicans in Congress have tried to tie Biden to the high inflation that gripped the nation beginning in 2021. But the most recent surveys indicate rising confidence in the economy.
Most Fed watchers think the central bank’s first rate reduction will occur in May or June. Late last year, Wall Street investors had bet that a rate cut in March was a near-certainty. But cautionary comments by a number of Fed officials have dispelled most expectations for a cut that soon.
Collectively, the policymakers likely feel little urgency to start cutting rates, a point that Chair Jerome Powell may stress in a news conference Wednesday. The economy remains healthy and doesn’t appear to need the stimulative benefits of a rate cut, which can spur more borrowing and spending and could even re-ignite inflation.
In addition, the stock market is near a record high, and the yield on the influential 10-year Treasury note, at just above 4 per cent, is well below its peak of nearly 5 per cent last fall. Average long-term mortgage rates, which typically track the 10-year yield, have dropped from nearly 8 per cent to about 6.7 per cent.
“The Fed’s probably thinking they’re not really in any rush, there’s no need to really rush into cutting rates,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale, a French bank. “That’s why the markets started to question the March rate cut.”
The economy expanded faster than expected in the final three months of the year, the government said last week. Its report showed that growth reached a surprisingly strong 3.3 per cent annual rate, far higher than expected, after a 4.9 per cent pace of expansion in the July-September quarter.
Consumers powered much of last quarter’s growth, with Americans opening their wallets for holiday shopping and spending freely on such major purchases as cars, appliances and furniture. That spending is benefiting companies like General Motors, which reported Tuesday that its revenue grew 10 per cent last year and that it made $10-billion in profit despite a six-week strike by the United Auto Workers union.
Public sentiment has also improved. Consumer confidence rose in January for a third straight month, according to the Conference Board, a business research group, to the highest level in two years. Growth has been robust even as inflation has sunk ever closer to the Fed’s 2 per cent target.
Measured over the past six months, in fact, inflation excluding volatile food and energy costs has slowed to a 1.9 per cent annual rate, according to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Compared with a year earlier, overall prices rose 2.6 per cent in December.
A year ago, many analysts were predicting that widespread layoffs and sharply higher unemployment would be needed to cool the economy and curb inflation. Yet solid hiring has persisted. The unemployment rate, at 3.7 per cent, isn’t far above a half-century low.
Yet some cracks have begun to appear in the job market and, if they worsen, could spur the Fed to cut rates more quickly. For several months, for example, most of the job growth has occurred in just a few sectors – health care, government and hotels, restaurants and entertainment. Any weakening in those areas of the economy could threaten hiring and the overall expansion.
And a report Tuesday showed that the number of workers who quit in December reached its lowest level in three years. That suggested that fewer Americans are being recruited for new, higher-paying jobs or are willing to search for and take new positions. Though quits remain at a level consistent with a solid job market, they have fallen about one-third from their peak in mid-2022.
Still, the U.S. economy is outpacing its counterparts overseas. During the October-December quarter, the 20 countries that share the euro currency barely avoided a recession, posting essentially no growth. Still, as in the United States, unemployment is very low in the euro area, and inflation has slowed to a 2.9 per cent annual rate. Though the European Central Bank could cut rates as soon as April, many economists think that might not happen until June.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-us-federal-reserve-likely-to-show-little-urgency-to-cut-interest-rates/

Investors are betting on five cuts in 2024, and that they will begin in either March or May.
The Fed has signaled that it will cut rates three times this year, without saying when it will happen. Policymakers have also made it clear in the last month that they are not in a rush and still need more confirmation that inflation is dropping sustainably to the Fed’s 2% target.
The good news for the Fed is that inflation continues to cool. The Fed’s favored inflation measure — the core Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices — clocked in at 2.9% for the month of December, down from 3.7% in September and 4.3% in June.
What was even more encouraging was that the core PCE inflation rate fell to 1.5% on a three-month annualized basis, its lowest since late 2020. On a six-month basis, it was 1.9% for the second month in a row.
The challenge for the Fed is that economic growth continues to surprise to the upside, clocking in at 3.3% for the fourth quarter.
That has some questioning whether inflation could reaccelerate. The strong economic numbers could also cause the Fed to hold rates at current levels for longer, as could a run up in the stock market that convinces consumers to spend more.
The Fed last hiked rates in July 2023 to a 22-year high and has elected to keep interest rates unchanged the past three policy meetings in a range of 5.25%-5.50%.

31,The Federal Reserve Meets Wednesday. Here’s What to Watch.,2024-01-31T10:02:41Z,Officials are likely to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of their January meeting. Here’s a look at what might come next.,"Federal Reserve officials will conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday, and they are widely expected to keep interest rates steady at a two-decade high when they release their policy decision at 2 p.m.
But investors are likely to closely watch the meeting — particularly Chair Jerome H. Powell’s 2:30 p.m. news conference — for hints of when policymakers might begin to lower interest rates. The Fed has held its policy rate in a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent since July, and officials projected in December that they might lower borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point over the course of 2024.
But both the timing and the magnitude of those rate cuts remain uncertain. On the one hand, inflation has come down more swiftly than many economists had expected in recent months. On the other, economic growth is proving stronger than anticipated, which could give companies the wherewithal to keep raising prices into the future.
Here’s what to know about this meeting.
The Fed’s statement could change.
The Fed’s post-meeting policy statement has suggested that officials will watch economic data “in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate.” Now that further rate increases are looking less and less likely, that language may be in for a tweak.",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/business/economy/federal-reserve-january-meeting.html

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.1% to 7,680.70 after a survey showed Australia’s inflation rate fell to a two-year low in the December quarter, with the consumer price index at 4.1%, leading to bets that the Reserve Bank may consider an interest rate cut in the next move.

Treasury yields were also mixed in the bond market following reports that showed the economy remains stronger than expected. One said confidence among consumers is climbing, while another suggested the job market may be warmer than forecast.
U.S. employers advertised 9 million job openings at the end of December, which was a touch more than economists expected and slightly above November’s level. Traders were expecting the data to show a cooldown in the number of openings.

A drawdown would have fit more neatly into the trend that’s carried Wall Street to a record: a slowdown in the economy’s growth strong enough to keep a lid on inflation but not so much that it will create a recession.
Hopes for a continued such trend are what have Wall Street foaming about the possibility of several cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year. Cuts would mark a sharp turnaround from the Fed's dramatic hikes to rates over the last two years, and the reductions would give a boost to the economy and investment prices.

The Federal Reserve began its latest policy meeting on interest rates Tuesday, but virtually no one expects it to cut rates this time. That won’t stop economists and traders from parsing every word coming out of the Fed Wednesday after its meeting finishes. They’ll be searching for clues that a rate cut may arrive at its next meeting in March.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, fell to 4.03% from 4.06% late Tuesday.

34,European markets,2024-01-31T05:30:27Z,European stocks opened higher Wednesday as global markets look ahead to the latest monetary policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.,"Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis on Wednesday reported 10% growth in net sales and 18% higher core operating income.
However, core net income came in below consensus analyst expectations.
Switzerland-listed shares were 4% lower at 8:23 a.m. in London.
The company said it expected net sales growth by a mid-single digit and core operating income to growth by a high single digit this year.
""A lot of great growth drivers are performing really well. So right now we have about 10 different products that had positive Phase III readouts last year, that gives us a lot of momentum,"" Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan told CNBC's Silvia Amaro.
""The difference in 2024 is we do face some products losing exclusivity. So we have three products ... which we expect to lose exclusivity in the United States. So that creates a little bit of headwinds for us. But overall, when you look at the underlying growth of our growth drivers, they are growing at double digits, and that should continue.""
The U.S. remains a key focus for the company, Narasimhan said, where it is targeting 50% of its sales.

The central bank's benchmark rate influences the cost of most consumer and business loans, and companies, investors and individuals have been eager for the central bank to ease the cost of borrowing.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve will likely move closer Wednesday to cutting its key interest rate after nearly two years of hikes that were intended to fight the worst inflation in decades. Yet it may not provide much of a hint about when — or how fast — it will do so.

The Fed is assessing the economy at a time when the intensifying presidential race is pivoting in no small part on voters’ perceptions of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship. Republicans in Congress have tried to tie Biden to the high inflation that gripped the nation beginning in 2021. But the most recent surveys indicate rising confidence in the economy.

Most Fed watchers think the central bank’s first rate reduction will occur in May or June. Late last year, Wall Street investors had bet that a rate cut in March was a near-certainty. But cautionary comments by a number of Fed officials have dispelled most expectations for a cut that soon.
Collectively, the policymakers likely feel little urgency to start cutting rates, a point that Chair Jerome Powell may stress in a news conference Wednesday. The economy remains healthy and doesn’t appear to need the stimulative benefits of a rate cut, which can spur more borrowing and spending and could even re-ignite inflation.
In addition, the stock market is near a record high, and the yield on the influential 10-year Treasury note, at just above 4%, is well below its peak of nearly 5% last fall. Average long-term mortgage rates, which typically track the 10-year yield, have dropped from nearly 8% to about 6.7%.

“The Fed’s probably thinking they’re not really in any rush, there’s no need to really rush into cutting rates,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale, a French bank. “That's why the markets started to question the March rate cut.”
The economy expanded faster than expected in the final three months of the year, the government said last week. Its report showed that growth reached a surprisingly strong 3.3% annual rate, far higher than expected, after a 4.9% pace of expansion in the July-September quarter.
Consumers powered much of last quarter’s growth, with Americans opening their wallets for holiday shopping and spending freely on such major purchases as cars, appliances and furniture. That spending is benefiting companies like General Motors, which reported Tuesday that its revenue grew 10% last year and that it made $10 billion in profit despite a six-week strike by the United Auto Workers union.
Public sentiment has also improved. Consumer confidence rose in January for a third straight month, according to the Conference Board, a business research group, to the highest level in two years. Growth has been robust even as inflation has sunk ever closer to the Fed’s 2% target.
Measured over the past six months, in fact, inflation excluding volatile food and energy costs has slowed to a 1.9% annual rate, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. Compared with a year earlier, overall prices rose 2.6% in December.

A year ago, many analysts were predicting that widespread layoffs and sharply higher unemployment would be needed to cool the economy and curb inflation. Yet solid hiring has persisted. The unemployment rate, at 3.7%, isn't far above a half-century low.
Yet some cracks have begun to appear in the job market and, if they worsen, could spur the Fed to cut rates more quickly. For several months, for example, most of the job growth has occurred in just a few sectors — health care, government and hotels, restaurants and entertainment. Any weakening in those areas of the economy could threaten hiring and the overall expansion.
And a report Tuesday showed that the number of workers who quit in December reached its lowest level in three years. That suggested that fewer Americans are being recruited for new, higher-paying jobs or are willing to search for and take new positions. Though quits remain at a level consistent with a solid job market, they have fallen about one-third from their peak in mid-2022.
Still, the U.S. economy is outpacing its counterparts overseas. During the October-December quarter, the 20 countries that share the euro currency barely avoided a recession, posting essentially no growth. Still, as in the United States, unemployment is very low in the euro area, and inflation has slowed to a 2.9% annual rate. Though the European Central Bank could cut rates as soon as April, many economists think that might not happen until June.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/31/business/federal-reserve-is-likely-show-little-urgency-cut-interest-rates-despite-markets-anticipation/
36,GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia stocks head for monthly loss as China drags; FOMC looms,2024-01-31T02:29:10Z,"Asian shares fell broadly on Wednesday, while the Australian dollar slid after surprisingly soft domestic inflation data and short-dated Treasury yields stayed elevated ahead of a rate decision from the Federal Reserve.

Chinese markets wobbled after an official factory survey showed China's manufacturing activity in January contracted for a fourth straight month. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.5% and was heading for a monthly loss of 5%, snapping a two-month winning streak.
That was in part due to a steep selloff in Chinese markets amid angst over the lack of large stimulus moves by authorities to shore up the economy and waning investor confidence. Concerns over the country's beleaguered property sector also continued to weigh, as investors wait to see how the liquidation of property giant China Evergrande Group will play out.
China's blue-chip index, which earlier this month sank to its lowest since 2019, was 0.7% lower on the day and down roughly 6% for January, marking its sixth straight monthly decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed more than 1%, weighed down by property and tech names, and was on track for its worst January performance since 2016.
Beijing has stepped in to put a floor under its sliding stock market, including a deep cut to banks' reserve requirements. ""There's a patently clear sign in my mind (that) they don't want the market to go down anymore,"" Mark Matthews, Bank Julius Baer's head of research for Asia, said at an outlook briefing in Singapore on Tuesday.
""Up until last week, they somehow thought that they could get away with just little dribs and drabs, and somebody must have decided somewhere that actually, no, we have to do more."" Japan's Nikkei, which has meanwhile been one of Asia's standouts, looked set to end the month with a more than 7% gain, its best January performance in over a decade.
The index was last down 0.5%, as expectations mount for an imminent BOJ pivot on monetary policy. A summary of opinions at the central bank's January policy meeting, released on Wednesday, showed that policymakers discussed the likelihood of a near-term exit from negative interest rates and possible scenarios for phasing out the bank's massive stimulus programme.
The yen extended its gains following the release of the minutes and was last marginally higher at 147.62 per dollar. Still, the currency was headed for a monthly loss of more than 4%, on the back of a resurgence in the dollar and as stark interest rate differentials remain between Japan and the U.S.
The Aussie dollar was last 0.6% lower at $0.6564 after data on Wednesday showed Australian consumer price inflation slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter to a two-year low, ramping up bets on imminent rate cuts. FED WATCH
Other market moves were largely subdued as traders stayed on guard ahead of the Fed's rate decision later in the day, with expectations that the central bank will keep rates on hold. The focus, however, will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, as well as any hints from policymakers on how soon the Fed could begin easing rates.
""It is too early to claim victory on inflation ... Therefore, we expect some persisting hints of tough language at this week's FOMC,"" said Benoit Anne, managing director in the investment solutions group at MFS Investment Management. ""But there is nothing to worry about. The macro backdrop is as good as we have seen in a very long time, characterised by diminished recession risks and favourable disinflation dynamics.""
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in December and data for the prior month was revised higher, pointing to a still-resilient labour market that is likely to give the Fed room to keep rates higher for longer. That propped up the two-year Treasury yield, which typically reflects near-term interest rate expectations. It was last at 4.3345%, having risen more than eight basis points for the month.
The U.S. dollar similarly held broadly steady, with the euro down 0.18% at $1.0823. Sterling fell 0.17% to $1.26795. Among commodities, oil prices dipped after climbing in the previous session as tensions linger in the Middle East.
Brent futures slipped 38 cents to $82.49 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 32 cents to $77.50 per barrel. Gold last bought $2,033.94 an ounce, retreating from a two-week top hit in the previous session.
