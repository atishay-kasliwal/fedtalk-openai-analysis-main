0,Will Biden stick with Powell at the Fed?,2021-04-28T16:44:01Z,President Joe Biden has a lot on his plate right now. But he'll soon need to make an important decision about the future of the Federal Reserve — a choice that will help shape his administration's economic policy in the coming years.,"New York (CNN Business) President Joe Biden has a lot on his plate right now. But he'll soon need to make an important decision about the future of the Federal Reserve — a choice that will help shape his administration's economic policy in the coming years.
It should seemingly be an easy decision for Biden to renominate Powell. But there's also a case to be made for Biden to follow the lead of his immediate predecessor and go with his own man or woman for Fed chair
On the ""keep Powell"" side, the central bank chief has won praise from Wall Street and economists for how the Fed quickly launched new lending programs and bond purchases last year to help prevent the economy from plunging into an even deeper recession due to Covid-19.
And there's precedent for Biden to stick with Powell so he can continue to manage the central bank's response to this economic crisis: After all, Biden's former boss, President Barack Obama, did exactly that when he re-nominated Ben Bernanke for a second term as Fed chair during the aftermath of the Great Recession.

""I'm not sure Biden wants to change horses midstream. There is a nasty history of new Fed chairs getting tested early in their first term and I don't think Biden wants to court that,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist with Interactive Brokers. ""I also don't think Biden is unhappy with Powell. You can't argue with what Powell has done for the economy overall, not just the stock market.""
Still, it's possible Biden will choose to put his own stamp on the Fed. President Donald Trump chose not to renominate Bernanke's successor, Janet Yellen, instead going with Powell. (Yellen is now Biden's Treasury secretary.)
If Biden does want to make a change, he has plenty of options.
A new Fed chair could further increase diversity in DC
Wall Street would probably be on board with current Fed governor Lael Brainard , former Fed vice chair and current TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson or Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic — all of whom had been rumored as potential picks for Treasury secretary.
And each one of them could make history if Biden tapped them to lead the Fed.
Brainard would be only the second woman (after Yellen) to be Fed chair and the nomination would send a strong message if Biden chose to have women in two of Washington's most powerful economic roles. And either Ferguson, who is set to soon retire from TIAA, or Bostic, would be the first Black chair in the Fed's more than 100-year history.
Sosnick told CNN Business that there is ""no need for change for change's sake"" at the Fed. Many other market observers believe that Powell will get a second term — provided he wants it.
But if not, investors would likely be comfortable with Brainard, Ferguson or Bostic. Strategists say none of them would be likely to change Powell's policies that dramatically and each would likely urge the Fed to keep interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future.
Certainly none of the trio is poised to be the second coming of the late Paul Volcker, the inflation-fighting Fed chair from the 1980s (and predecessor to Alan Greenspan) who raised rates numerous times during his tenure.
""There is nobody that Biden would pick who would operate the Fed much differently than Powell,"" said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.
And if the economy continues to recover, then it's only logical for Powell to get one more term as Fed chair.
""The pandemic has altered the calculus. As long as the Fed continues to support Biden's economic policies with low interest rates and higher asset purchases, Biden will be comfortable with Powell at the Fed,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
'Path of least resistance' for economy and market
Arone added that replacing Powell makes sense only if the economy drastically starts to cool off, which could make Wall Street more receptive to a new Fed chair.
""Biden has to think about how disruptive a change would be to the markets and economy"" Arone said. ""Powell is the path of least resistance.""
But if the recovery stalls out, ""Powell could be the scapegoat and it would be an easy change to name Brainard or Ferguson, which would also fit into the broader Biden diversity agenda,"" Arone said.
The clock on Biden's Fed decision is starting to tick. For context, President Obama announced in August of his first term that he would renominate Bernanke. President Trump nominated Powell in November 2017. So Biden will have to make a choice in the coming months.
The White House had no comment for CNN when asked about whether Biden has made any decision regarding Powell.
Powell has also repeatedly declined to discuss his future when asked about it, and he is likely to do so again when he holds a press conference later Wednesday to discuss monetary policy.
Even if Powell sticks around, experts say Brainard, Ferguson or Bostic may not be warming the bench for long. If Biden is re-elected in 2024 (or if Vice President Kamala Harris runs and wins) any of the three still make sense as a Fed chair to replace Powell in 2026.",https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/28/economy/federal-reserve-jerome-powell-successor/index.html

The U.S. central bank’s policy statement is expected to largely follow the mold established in December, when the Fed said it would not change monetary policy until there was “substantial further progress” in meeting its maximum employment and 2% inflation goals. The statement is due at 2 p.m. EDT.
“Investors are obviously looking for a continuation of the policy, which is very accommodative,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC, New Jersey.
“They don’t want to hear, ‘We are going to raise rates’. If something goes wrong, investors want to know the Fed will be there.”

The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Monday completed a full recovery from its 11% correction that began in February, largely supported by a rise in mega-cap stocks and ebbing inflation fears.
Microsoft Corp met quarterly sales expectations and beat profit estimates, but its shares fell 3.3% and pressured the Nasdaq due to skepticism about one-off benefits included in the results and high hopes after a year-long rally.
Biotech Amgen Inc’s 7.5% decline weighed on the Dow after it said its first-quarter sales and profit fell due to a 7% drop in its net drug prices and a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Boeing Co fell 3.4% after posting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and pausing 737 MAX deliveries over an electrical issue that has partly re-grounded the fleet.

(Reuters) - Financial firms swimming in reserves are parking more of their cash overnight at the New York Federal Reserve’s reverse repo facility.
Usage of the reverse repurchase facility, which gives firms somewhere to temporarily place their cash in exchange for a small return, surged in recent days. Firms stored $142 billion overnight with the facility on Tuesday and $101 billion on Monday, the largest operations since roughly a year ago.
The higher demand for the facility, which typically sees little take-up, is increasing speculation that the Fed may need to make some technical adjustments soon to keep short-term rates from falling too low.
“The problem of excess front-end cash is only going to worsen over the next few months,” John Canavan, lead analyst for Oxford Economics wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
Short-term interest rates are drifting lower in part because of the Fed’s $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, a surge in bank reserves and a drop in the government’s cash stockpile as it pays out pandemic relief payments and tax refunds.
The Fed’s options include adjusting the Fed’s overnight reverse repo rate for non-banks, which is currently at 0%, or raising the interest it pays banks for excess reserves (IOER) from 0.10%.
But some analysts, including Canavan, say the Fed may not necessarily act at this week’s meeting. The central bank has historically only made such technical adjustments, when the effective federal funds rate is within 5 basis points of the top or bottom of the target range, which is currently 0-0.25%. The Fed funds rate has held steady at 0.07% since mid-February, except for a temporary dip to 0.06% at the end of March.
With the tool working “for the time being,” the Fed could also choose to keep such adjustments separate from monetary policy decisions, Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery of BMO Capital Markets wrote in an emailed note on Tuesday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-reverse-repo/demand-surges-for-new-york-feds-reverse-repo-facility-idUSL1N2ML1W4

No major policy changes are expected at the meeting, but investors are awaiting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments for any signs that the bank may start talking about tapering its bond buying. The Fed has promised it will continue purchases at their current pace until ""substantial further progress"" is made in an economic recovery from the pandemic.
Benchmark Treasury yields have stabilized in April after suffering their worst quarterly performance since 2009, when expectations that a vast U.S. fiscal stimulus would reignite economic growth and inflation pushed yields, which move inversely with prices, sharply higher. But the stabilization has started to lose steam this week, with 10-year yields up 8 basis points over the last two sessions.
German bonds, which are closely correlated with Treasuries, caught up with the Treasury sell-off on Wednesday. Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro area, was up 2 basis points to -0.23%, after rising to its highest since late February at -0.203%.
Italy's 10-year bond yield broke another seven-month high at 0.864%, though the sell-off in German bonds helped bring down the closely watched risk premium Italy pays on top of Germany down to around 106 bps. It had touched 108 bps on Tuesday, the highest since early February. Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank, said the negative open to the European bond market was expected, given Treasury yields mostly rose following the European close on Tuesday. Bond yields rise when prices fall.
""The upward move in U.S. Treasury yields is driven by the expectations for a more upbeat Federal Reserve committee as well as the solid rise in the consumer confidence,"" Sorensen said, referring to U.S. data for April that jumped to a 14-month high on Tuesday. In contrast, German consumer morale deteriorated unexpectedly heading into May, given rising COVID-19 infections and a re-tightening of restrictions in many areas of Europe's largest economy.
In the primary market, Germany raised 2.132 billion euros from the re-opening of a 15-year bond.

11,TREASURIES-Yields erase earlier rise to be little changed before Fed meeting statement,2021-04-28T13:56:16Z,"U.S. Treasury yields gave back earlier gains on Wednesday before the Federal Reserve is due to conclude its two-day meeting, with investors focused on whether the U.S. central bank will give any hints towards removing its unprecedented accommodation as the American economy...","(Adds quotes, details on Fed, Biden calendar, economic outlook) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields gave back earlier gains on Wednesday before the Federal Reserve is due to conclude its two-day meeting, with investors focused on whether the U.S. central bank will give any hints towards removing its unprecedented accommodation as the American economy improves. Business reopenings from COVID-19-related shutdowns have accelerated this month, and investors are also pricing for higher inflation as fiscal spending increases. “With the reopening process, it seems to have hit a higher gear in April,” said Tom Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. Investors will be watching to see whether the Fed indicates that it may taper its bond purchases as the economy bounces back, though the Fed is viewed as unlikely to give any firm signals that tightening is near. “There has to be an acknowledgement that its somewhere out there on the timeline, but I think that’s about as far as we’re going to go,"" Simons said. ""It’s more likely at the next meeting we get something more concrete on that front. “It’s going to be more or less a tightrope walk trying to acknowledge what’s gone on in the economy over the inter-meeting period, which has pretty much all been positive, while also not really saying that the Fed is any closer to pulling back on accommodation,” he added. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have pulled back from one-year highs of 1.776% reached last month, and have been trading at the bottom end of their recent range before rising this week. The 10-year yields were last little changed on the day at 1.627%, after earlier rising to 1.652%. Inflation expectations, meanwhile, hit eight-year highs, with breakeven rates on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities pricing in average annual inflation of 2.43% for the next decade. Gross domestic product data on Thursday is expected to show strong growth in the first quarter, while next week’s employment data for April should also show an improving labor market. U.S. President Joe Biden will address Congress on Wednesday with his plans to spend $1.5 trillion on childcare and college education and raise taxes on wealthy Americans to pay for it. That is on top of a $2 trillion jobs-and-infrastructure plan paid for by raising taxes on U.S. companies. Market participants will also watch to see whether the U.S. central bank raises the interest it pays on excess reserves (IOER) and overnight reverse repurchase agreements as borrowing rates in repo intermittently trade negative and short-term bill yields approach zero.

Stocks look set for a slightly lower open Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve’s policy decision.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have dropped 77 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures were little changed, and Nasdaq Composite futures have declined 0.16%.
The market isn’t moving, and the Fed almost certainly won’t be either. It’s expected to keep policy as is, leaving the benchmark lending rate near 0% and maintaining the size of its bond purchasing program. But investors are looking for hints that the Fed will begin reducing the size of that program sooner rather than later, as the economy has recovered more quickly than expected.
“Wednesday’s FOMC statement is arguably the most important statement so far this year, as investors are increasingly trying to figure out when the Fed may start to pare back its Covid-19-related stimulus, since the economy is recovering at a faster-than-expected rate,” said Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence.
Why does that matter? A smaller asset purchasing program drives fewer dollars into bonds, which would lower prices and lift yields, all else being equal. And that, in turn, could make bonds more attractive to investors relative to stocks.
Here are five stocks making moves in Wednesday’s premarket action:
Microsoft (MSFT) stock fell 2.8% after reporting a profit of $1.95 a share, beating forecasts for $1.78 a share, on sales of $41.7 billion, above expectations for $41 billion.
Alphabet (GOOGL) stock rose 5% after reporting a profit of $26.29 a share, beating forecasts for $15.64 a share, on sales of $55.31 billion, above expectations for $51.66 billion.
Boeing (BA) stock fell 1.7% after reporting a loss of $1.53 a share, larger than the $1.16 loss forecast by Wall Street, on sales of $15.22 billion, above expectations for $15 billion.
ViacomCBS (VIAC) stock dropped 1% even after getting upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup.
Spirit Airlines (SAVE) stock dropped 3.5% after getting downgraded to In-line from Outperform at Evercore.

Microsoft Corp met quarterly sales expectations and beat profit estimates, but its shares fell 2.7% in premarket trading on skepticism about one-off benefits included in the results and high hopes after a year-long rally.
Google parent Alphabet Inc jumped 5.1% on reporting record profit for the second consecutive quarter and a $50 billion share buyback but warned a surge in usage and ad sales during the pandemic may slow as people resume in-person activities.
Meanwhile, the U.S. central bank’s policy statement is expected to largely follow the mold established in December, when the Fed said it would not change monetary policy until there had been “substantial further progress” in meeting its maximum employment and 2% inflation goals. The statement is due at 2 p.m. EDT.
“Investors will get what they are expecting, which is continued super dovish comments from the Fed,” said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management in Cleveland.
“If there is any change from that stand, it’ll be a big deal for the markets, but that is unlikely.”

The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Monday completed a full recovery from its 11% correction that began in February, largely supported by a rise in megacap stocks and ebbing inflation fears.

LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Copper eased from 10-year highs on Wednesday ahead of a policy announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but analysts at Goldman Sachs joined others predicting a rally to record levels.
Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.3% at $9,823.50 a tonne in official trading after reaching $9,965 on Tuesday, the highest since 2011.
Prices have more than doubled since March 2020 as the world economy rebounds and the shift to greener, more copper intensive energy raises the prospect of supply shortages.
“It is only a question of time before it exceeds the psychologically important $10,000 mark,” said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann, adding that the all-time high of $10,190 would be likely be breached shortly afterwards.
But he said the rally looked overstretched a sharp correction was likely before copper rises further in the years ahead.
GOLDMAN: Goldman Sachs forecast copper would average $9,675 a tonne in 2021, $11,875 a tonnes in 2022 and $12,000 a tonne in 2023.
CHILE: The threat of strikes at copper mines in Chile receded after the country allowed another drawdown in pensions, pleasing workers.
SUPPLY OUTLOOK: Ample supplies next year and in 2023 will keep the market balanced, but miners need to start investing in new capacity now to meet a pick up in demand growth.
MARKETS/FED: World shares were near record highs and the dollar and global bond yields nudged higher. Markets will be watching for signs that the Fed will tighten policy in a statement due at 1800 GMT.
TIN: LME tin was up 2.1% at $27,706 a tonne after reaching $27,850, its highest since 2011. Supplies are short, with stockpiles in LME-registered warehouses at just 1,300 tonnes. MSNSTX-TOTAL

The broad expectation is that it won’t want to unsettle markets for now, and with a packed day of corporate earnings, economic data and U.S. President Joe Biden’s first address before a joint Congress session, there was plenty to navigate.
MSCI’s broadest index of world shares was sidestepping towards its best month of the year so far, with Europe’s bourses fighting for modest gains [.EU] and S&P 500 futures flat after Wall Street’s more than 5% April spurt. [.N]
In the FX markets, the dollar was on course for its first unbroken two-day run of gains of the month - April is currently set to be its cruellest month since last July. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, whose swift rise earlier in the year caught markets off guard, touched their highest in nearly two weeks at 1.647%.
“The thing that we are going to watch most closely is if the Fed says anything along the lines of tapering of asset purchases,” said Jim Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
“As long that doesn’t get mentioned, we are all good,” he said, explaining that with the coronavirus pandemic still worsening in many parts of the world, investors would view any move towards tapering as premature.
Most Fed watchers expect Chairman Jerome Powell to repeat the bank’s recent message that its low interest rates and support programmes will remain in place for a long time yet.
Biden will also address Congress and is likely to underscore his administration’s plans for mass infrastructure and stimulus spending.
These developments would normally be positive for stocks, but analysts say so much economic optimism is already priced into the equity market that it is difficult to budge equities further from current levels.
Otherwise, Europe’s traders were waiting to hear from ECB President Christine Lagarde and other top policymakers. Economic data releases showed an unexpected drop in Germany’s GfK consumer confidence reading for May though an equivalent in France at least stayed steady for April.

The greenback edged up slightly against the yen and the British pound, but trading is expected to be subdued until Powell speaks after the Fed meeting.
Pound followers are also watching next week’s UK regional elections, especially in Scotland where the pro-independence SNP and Green parties look on course to take firm control Scotland’s Holyrood parliament.
“With the pro-independence parties likely to secure a majority in the May 6 Holyrood election, we see a 15% chance of independence,” investment bank Morgan Stanley said in a research note to clients, adding there was a 30% chance that a new referendum would be held.
As well as the rise in Treasury yields helping the dollar higher, break-even rates on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, a measure of expected annual inflation for the coming decade, rose to 2.41%, the highest since 2013.

21,FOREX-Dollar drifts higher before Fed decision,2021-04-28T11:19:29Z,The U.S. dollar drifted higher on Wednesday as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy statement and a speech by Joe Biden later in the day where the U.S. president is set to announce more stimulus plans.,"The U.S. dollar drifted higher on Wednesday as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy statement and a speech by Joe Biden later in the day where the U.S. president is set to announce more stimulus plans. Though the greenback recovered from a one-month low hit earlier this week, investors expect the U.S. central bank to maintain its policy settings and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is seen as likely to repeat his dovish message.
While currency markets were generally calm, signs of nervousness were evident in the bond markets where yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose above 1.60% after tepid auction results. With the consensus broadly that the Fed will remain on hold, any small shift in rhetoric could trigger an outsized move in markets.
The dollar index rose 0.2% at 91.047, bouncing from Monday's low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3, though investors were not convinced a recent downtrend had ended. ""The Fed has been fighting a rearguard action against calls for higher rates in the face of extremely strong data and the prospects of more stimulus, and most likely they will keep the same phrasing as before,"" said John Marley, CEO of forexxtra, a London-based FX consultancy.
Investors' inflation expectations, measured by the break-even inflation rate calculated from U.S. inflation-linked bonds, rose above 2.40% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2013. The euro slipped 0.2% to $1.2070, off Monday's two-month high of $1.2117.
The dollar stood at 108.97 yen, having jumped 0.59% overnight and extending its recovery from a seven-week low of 107.48 touched last week, in tandem with rises in U.S. bond yields. Biden is expected to roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including the largest-ever increase in levies on investment gains, in order to fund about $1 trillion in childcare and other social spending.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.77415 after the country's consumer price index came in weaker than expected.

22,Global Stocks Mixed Ahead of Fed Decision and Another Batch of Earnings,2021-04-28T10:02:00Z,"Investors are taking to the sideline, as a policy decision from the Federal Reserve awaits, plus more big-name earnings from Boeing and Apple, to name a few.","Text size
Global stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with U.S. equity futures mostly lower, as bond yields rose ahead of a policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee. Investors are absorbing a batch of earnings news, with results from Boeing and Apple ahead.
Asian stocks mostly gained across the board, though the KOSPI fell 1%, with SK Hynix shares slumping 3.7%, after the South Korean memory-chip maker’s net profit missed consensus. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was flat, despite a flood of earnings news, with shares of Deutsche Bank soaring after the best quarter in years.
Dow industrial and Nasdaq-100 futures edged lower, while S&P 500 futures were flat, after a largely flat to lower day for stocks. Investors are waiting on a policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on Wednesday, with a news conference to follow by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
Rising yields were in the spotlight again, with those of the 10-year Treasury note up 3 basis points to 1.6423%, following the biggest daily jump in four weeks on Tuesday. Investors appeared to be positioning ahead of the Fed’s decision, even though most analysts aren’t anticipating any big shift in either tone or a major policy move.
“Though the broad consensus is that Jerome Powell and the rest of the FOMC will keep things unchanged this evening, there have been some reports suggesting that the topic of tapering bond purchases could be broached. If that is the case, then the markets could be about to end April on a bum note,” said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, in a note to clients.
As well, stocks have logged a strong April, with the S&P 500 up over 5% and the Nasdaq Composite up more than 6%.
“The fact that benchmarks are already trading close to record levels is weighing on market sentiment with investors needing further bullish catalysts to remove fears of a correction and drive prices further up,” said Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades, in a note to clients.
President Joe Biden ‘s first major speech to Congress later on Wednesday may also attract attention.
“The core of that [speech] will be him laying out the specifics of the American Families Plan, his commitment to child care, to education,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week, “and ensuring that there’s an investment in economic security from the federal government.”
Investors will be keeping a close eye on earnings, notably from the technology sector, with Apple, Facebook and PayPal all due to report after the market close, along with chip and telecommunications equipment maker Qualcomm and online auctioneer eBay.
Ahead of those results, aircraft giant Boeing will report, though analysts aren’t expecting a big earnings beat or terribly upbeat guidance. E-commerce group Shopify will also report, along with amusement park owner Six Flags.
Shares of Microsoft dropped 5% in premarket trading, as the technology giant’s better-than-expected results may have still disappointed some, given shares have climbed 11% in the past month.
Alphabet’s shares climbed 5%, after the parent of Google reported a profit that nearly doubled Wall Street expectations, while sales were also a solid beat. As well, the company said the board of directors authorized an additional $50 billion in buybacks of its Class C shares.
Pinterest was another company that fell short of a high investor bar. Despite beating earnings expectations in its first quarter, shares of the social-media group fell sharply. The stock has gained 290% in the past year.
In Europe, Deutsche Bank reported higher-than-expected profit and revenue, helped by a strong performance by its investment bank. The German lender boosted its year-outlook for revenue, as well as for its investment-bank unit. Shares climbed nearly 7%, with analysts at Citigroup noting it was the best quarter for Deutsche Bank in eight years.
WPP shares also climbed in Europe, after becoming the latest advertising group to post forecast-beating results as the industry rebounds from the Covid-19 pandemic.",https://www.barrons.com/articles/global-stocks-mixed-as-investors-await-a-fed-decision-and-more-earnings-51619604147
23,"EMERGING MARKETS-Rising dollar, yields keep lid on emerging stocks, currencies",2021-04-28T09:31:19Z,A jump in U.S. Treasury yields and a firmer dollar kept emerging market currencies in check and stymied developing market stocks on Wednesday as investors awaited a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.,"* U.S. Treasury yields jump to two-week high
* Russia’s rouble gains 0.4% ahead of OFZ auction
* Most central European currencies soften against euro
April 28 (Reuters) - A jump in U.S. Treasury yields and a firmer dollar kept emerging market currencies in check and stymied developing market stocks on Wednesday as investors awaited a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
MSCI’s indexes of emerging currencies and stocks slipped 0.1% ahead of the Fed meeting. Markets are hoping for confirmation that policymakers have no appetite to tinker with support for the economy following a recent run of good U.S. data.
“We expect more of the same from Fed at the upcoming meeting, framing the story of no rate hike until 2024 and that Fed will be patient of inflation overshoots and be behind the curve in terms of tightening policy,” analysts at Maybank wrote in a note to clients.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden will also address Congress later in the day and is likely to underscore his administration’s plans for mass infrastructure and stimulus spending.
An improving U.S. economy and expectations for big fiscal spending are causing more investors to question the levels of quantitative easing through bond purchases and how much inflation policymakers would tolerate.
The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield climbed to a two-week high and the dollar index gained 0.2%, leaving limited breathing space for emerging currencies.
South Africa’s rand weakened 0.2% while the Turkish lira climbed 0.4% in a third day of gains, with local bankers crediting locals buying lira for advances in recent days.
Russia’s rouble strengthened 0.4% to trade below 75 to the dollar with steady crude oil futures providing support. The gains came ahead of an OFZ treasury bond auction, which will be keenly watched after U.S. imposed sanctions that will affect foreign buying of Russian debt.
Russia’s return to a neutral monetary policy with its latest increase in interest rates will not hamper economic recovery, Central Bank First Deputy Governor Ksenia Yudayeva said.
Yudayeva added that inflationary expectations in Russia are “very high” and keep rising, explaining the rationale behind the central bank’s decision to hike the benchmark rate to 5% last week.
Most central European currencies also dropped against the euro, with Hungary’s Forint, Polish zloty and the Czech crown falling between 0.5% and 0.2%.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.3%, with travel and leisure stocks easing from all-time highs, and miners retreating after a recent rally. The region's banking sector was up 0.3% and insurers rose 0.6%.
Deutsche Bank jumped 6.5% to the top of STOXX 600, as strength at its investment bank helped the German bank post a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. Topping London's FTSE 100, Lloyds Banking Group rose 3.3% after reporting a better-than-expected profit.
Sweden's SEB and Spain's Santander inched lower after their quarterly results. ""At a market level, Europe has performed strongly year-to-date and it's clear that there has been an anticipation that the recovery will be quite sharp and strong,"" said Tom Dorner, investment director for European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""You're still seeing a rotation in the market in favour of the more cyclical names like banks and autos.""
Investors, however, stayed away from making big bets ahead of the U.S. central bank's policy announcement due at 1800 GMT. Policymakers are widely expected to reaffirm their stance to keep monetary policy loose until enough economic progress has been made. Earnings at European companies in the first quarter of 2021 are expected to surge 71.3% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data, up from last week's forecast of a 61.2% jump.
The world's biggest advertising company WPP rose 2.9% on returning to underlying growth in the first quarter, as clients launched new products and brands. German food delivery company Delivery Hero jumped 5.9%, as it expects revenues to more than double in 2021.
Among decliners, Lysol maker Reckitt Benckiser Group fell 1.4%, even as the company backed its full-year outlook. British supermarket chain Sainsbury's dropped 2.5%, after it reported a 39% fall in annual underlying profit.

The broad expectation is that it won’t want to unsettle markets for now, and with a packed day of corporate earnings, economic data and U.S. President Joe Biden’s first address before a joint Congress session, there was plenty to navigate.
MSCI’s broadest index of world shares was sidestepping towards its best month of the year so far as Europe’s bourses struggled to hang on to some modest early gains and S&P 500 futures went flat.
In the FX markets, the dollar was on course for its first unbroken two-day run of gains of the month - April is currently set to be its worst month since last July. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, whose swift rise earlier in the year caught markets off guard, touched their highest in nearly two weeks at 1.647%.
“The thing that we are going to watch most closely is if the Fed says anything along the lines of tapering of asset purchases,” said Jim Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley.
“As long that doesn’t get mentioned, we are all good,” he said, explaining that with the coronavirus pandemic still worsening in many parts of the world, investors would view any mention of tapering as a premature step.
Most Fed watchers expect the bank’s Chairman Jerome Powell to repeat the bank’s recent message that its low interest rates and support programmes will remain in place for a long time yet.
U.S. President Joe Biden will also address Congress and is likely to underscore his administration’s plans for mass infrastructure and stimulus spending.
These developments would normally be positive for stocks, but analysts say so much economic optimism is already priced into the equity market that it is difficult to budge stocks further from current levels.
Otherwise, Europe’s traders were waiting to hear from ECB President Christine Lagarde and a number of other top policymakers. Economic data releases include Germany’s GfK consumer confidence reading for May and France’s consumer confidence reading for April.
APPLE EYED
U.S. earnings later include tech and internet giants Apple, Facebook and Qualcomm, as well as Boeing, GlaxoSmithKline and Ford. The preliminary March reading for U.S wholesale inventories is also due.
There had been mixed bag of earnings from Tesla, 3M, Microsoft, and Google-parent Alphabet on Tuesday.
In the FX markets, the dollar index rose 0.2% at 91.047, bouncing from Monday’s low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3.
The greenback edged up slightly against the yen and the British pound, but trading is expected to be subdued until Powell speaks after the Fed meeting.
As well as the rise in Treasury yields helping the dollar higher, break-even rates on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, a measure of expected annual inflation for the coming decade, rose to 2.41%, the highest since 2013.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was knocked lower after disappointing data on consumer prices and in the cryptocurrency market there was excitement as the European Investment Bank said it would sell a two-year digital bond worth 100 million euros ($120.80 million) on the ethereum blockchain network.
Rival cryptocurrency Bitcoin edged lower to $55,618.
In commodities, Brent crude futures fell a touch to $66.40 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 0.03% to $62.92 per barrel due to worries about energy demand.
Benchmark copper edged back from a decade high of $9,965 a tonne hit on Tuesday due to some concerns about a possible softening of demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the metal.

The dollar index stood at 91.004, bouncing from Monday’s low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3, though investors were not convinced a recent downtrend had ended.
“The backdrop for the (dollar index) is an unappetising one,” Westpac strategists wrote in a note, predicting the gauge will drop toward 90 this week.
The greenback’s decline stemmed largely from receding bets that the Federal Reserve could start laying the ground work for future policy tightening soon as the U.S. economy rapidly recovers.
On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank is widely expected to maintain its policy settings and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is seen as likely to repeat his dovish message.
But some analysts say signs of rising inflation expectations could nudge the Fed to abandon its rhetoric that a policy tightening is still a long way off.
Investors’ inflation expectations, measured by the break-even inflation (BEI) rate calculated from U.S. inflation-linked bonds, rose above 2.40% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2013.
“In a way, the rise in the BEI above 2% is what the Fed has been wishing for. Still, if it goes too far it could raise alarm at the Fed. The Fed will probably not be able to overlook a rise in BEI above 2.5%,” said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Federal Reserve said last year it aims to bring average inflation to around 2% and to allow it to overshoot above 2%, rather than trying to cap it around 2%.
The euro slipped 0.2% to $1.2073, off Monday’s two-month high of $1.2117.
The dollar stood at 108.855 yen, having jumped 0.59% overnight and extending its recovery from a seven-week low of 107.48 touched last week, in tandem with rises in U.S. bond yields.
The yen was on the back foot as Japan’s economic recovery is being hampered by recent surges in COVID-19 cases and after the Bank of Japan acknowledged that inflation will fail to reach its key 2% target through early 2023.
“When you look around, the Bank of Canada already started tapering. The Bank of England could come next. The ECB (European Central Bank) might drop a hint of tapering in June. And we will hear from the Fed today. Compared with all that, there’s a sense that the BOJ is quite behind,” said Jun Arachi, forex strategist at Rakuten Securities.
The Japanese currency slipped even against low-yielding European currencies, hitting a 2-1/2-year low versus the euro, at 131.57 per euro and a five-year low on the Swiss franc, at 119.08 per franc.
Besides the Fed, investors are looking to President Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress, also scheduled later on Wednesday.
Biden is expected to roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including the largest-ever increase in levies on investment gains, to fund about $1 trillion in childcare.
News reports about his tax hike plan dented markets’ risk appetite only briefly on Friday, but analysts think there could be a bigger reaction if the plan becomes more concrete.
“In addition to tax policies that have resurfaced as a market focus, his stance on diplomacy should attract some attention given recent tensions with China and Russia,” said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar dropped 0.3% to $0.77415 after the country’s consumer price index came in weaker than expected.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan declined 0.12%. Australian stocks rose 0.47%, but shares in China slipped 0.06%. South Korean stocks fell 0.99%. Stocks in Tokyo edged 0.46% higher.
S&P 500 e-mini stock futures rose 0.14%.
Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.25%, German DAX futures up 0.16%, FTSE futures up 0.31%, pointing to a positive start to European trading.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected later on Wednesday to reaffirm that easy monetary policy will remain in place for a prolonged period and dismiss any suggestions of tapering bond purchases.
U.S. President Joe Biden will also address a joint session of Congress, where he may make additional comments about infrastructure and stimulus spending.
These developments would normally be a positive for stocks, but analysts say so much economic optimism is already priced into the equity market that it is difficult to buy stocks further from current levels.
“We expect the Fed’s tone on the economy to be more positive than at the March FOMC meeting, reflecting the ongoing pickup in the data, but we don’t expect any substantive new signal yet on tapering,” analysts at TD Securities wrote in a research note.
“While we do not expect much price action due to the Fed decision, Biden’s remarks could continue to suggest more incoming supply, bear steepening the (Treasury yield) curve.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01%, but the S&P 500 lost 0.02%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.34% as investors digested a mixed bag of earnings from Tesla Inc, 3M Co, Microsoft Corp, and Google-parent Alphabet overnight.
Some investors were also reluctant to move before earnings from heavyweights Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, and Amazon.com Inc due later this week.
An improving U.S. economy, rising coronavirus vaccination rates, and expectations for big fiscal spending are causing more investors to question when the Fed will start slowing its bond purchases and how much inflation policymakers will tolerate.

The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.4853 per dollar prior to market open, 71 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.4924 and the strongest such guidance since March 12. The spot market opened at 6.4880 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.4868 at midday, 38 pips weaker than the previous late session close. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.4827 per dollar. The dollar, which gained against its peers for a third day, is set to take its cues from the Federal Reserve's policy statement and a speech by President Joe Biden on Wednesday. It seeks to extend a recovery from an eight-week low touched earlier in the week against a basket of currencies. Traders said the yuan remained rangebound as the dollar index traded mainly below the 91 level ahead of the Fed meeting, and the possibility could not be ruled out that the dollar index continues to slide after the meeting. ""The recent yuan rebound was mainly due to the weakness in the dollar index,"" said a trader at a foreign bank. ""I believe the dollar index would remain weak, giving the yuan appreciation room."" Investors will be scrutinising the Fed's comments at the close of its policy meeting later on Wednesday, for insight into its thinking on inflation, bond purchases and risks to the financial system posed by soaring asset prices. CIB Research said in a report the yuan would maintain strength given the global resurgence of the coronavirus. The resilience of the Chinese economy will also bolster the yuan. China's economic rebound from a pandemic-induced slump is forecast to be the strongest this year, the Asian Development Bank said on Wednesday. The economy was forecast to grow 8.1%, driven by strong domestic demand and exports, before moderating to 5.5% in 2022. The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 96.72, firmer than 96.68 previously.

World shares cosied up close to record highs and the dollar and global bond yields nudged up on Wednesday, as traders waited to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve utters the dreaded 'T' word later - tapering of its mass stimulus programme.
The broad expectation is that it won't want to unsettle markets for now, and with a packed day of corporate earnings, economic data and U.S. President Joe Biden's first address before a joint Congress session read more , there was plenty to navigate.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares (.MIWD00000PUS) was sidestepping towards its best month of the year so far as Europe's bourses struggled to hang on to some modest early gains and S&P 500 futures went flat.
In the FX markets, the dollar was on course for its first unbroken two-day run of gains of the month - April is currently set to be its worst month since last July. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, whose swift rise earlier in the year caught markets off guard, touched their highest in nearly two weeks at 1.647%.
""The thing that we are going to watch most closely is if the Fed says anything along the lines of tapering of asset purchases,"" said Jim Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley.
""As long that doesn't get mentioned, we are all good,"" he said, explaining that with the coronavirus pandemic still worsening in many parts of the world, investors would view any mention of tapering as a premature step.
Most Fed watchers expect the bank's Chairman Jerome Powell to repeat the bank's recent message that its low interest rates and support programmes will remain in place for a long time yet.
U.S. President Joe Biden will also address Congress and is likely to underscore his administration's plans for mass infrastructure and stimulus spending. read more
These developments would normally be positive for stocks, but analysts say so much economic optimism is already priced into the equity market that it is difficult to budge stocks further from current levels.
Otherwise, Europe's traders were waiting to hear from ECB President Christine Lagarde and a number of other top policymakers. Economic data releases include Germany’s GfK consumer confidence reading for May and France’s consumer confidence reading for April.
APPLE EYED
U.S. earnings later include tech and internet giants Apple, Facebook and Qualcomm, as well as Boeing, GlaxoSmithKline and Ford. The preliminary March reading for U.S wholesale inventories is also due.
There had been mixed bag of earnings from Tesla (TSLA.O), 3M (MMM.N), Microsoft (MSFT.O), and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) on Tuesday.
In the FX markets, the dollar index rose 0.2% at 91.047 , bouncing from Monday's low of 90.679, its weakest level since March 3.
The greenback edged up slightly against the yen and the British pound , but trading is expected to be subdued until Powell speaks after the Fed meeting.
As well as the rise in Treasury yields helping the dollar higher, break-even rates on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities , a measure of expected annual inflation for the coming decade, rose to 2.41%, the highest since 2013.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was knocked lower after disappointing data on consumer prices and in the cryptocurrency market there was excitement as the European Investment Bank said it would sell a two-year digital bond worth 100 million euros ($120.80 million) on the ethereum blockchain network.

38,"Fed keeps key rate near zero, sees inflation as ‘transitory’",2021-04-28T04:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is keeping its ultra-low interest rate policies in place, a sign that it wants to see more evidence of a strengthening economic recovery before it would consider easing its support.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is keeping its ultra-low interest rate policies in place, a sign that it wants to see more evidence of a strengthening economic recovery before it would consider easing its support.
In a statement Wednesday, the Fed expressed a brighter outlook, saying the economy has improved along with the job market. And while the policymakers noted that inflation has risen, they ascribed the increase to temporary factors.
The Fed also signaled its belief that the pandemic’s threat to the economy has diminished, a significant point given Chair Jerome Powell’s long-stated view that the recovery depends on the virus being brought under control. Last month, the Fed had cautioned that the virus posed “considerable risks to the economic outlook.” On Wednesday, it said only that “risks to the economic outlook remain” because of the pandemic.
The central bank left its benchmark short-term rate near zero, where it’s been since the pandemic erupted nearly a year ago, to help keep loan rates down to encourage borrowing and spending. It also said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that it would keep buying $120 billion in bonds each month to try to keep longer-term borrowing rates low.
And at a news conference, Powell made explicitly clear that the Fed is in no hurry to pull back on the pace of its bond buying. The policymakers, Powell stressed, first want to see evidence of sustained and substantial improvements in the job market and the overall economy.
The U.S. economy has been posting unexpectedly strong gains in recent weeks, with barometers of hiring, spending and manufacturing all surging. Most economists say they detect the early stages of what could be a robust and sustained recovery, with coronavirus case counts declining, vaccinations rising and Americans spending their stimulus-boosted savings.
In March, employers added nearly 1 million jobs — an unheard-of figure before the pandemic. And in April, consumer confidence jumped to its highest level since the pandemic flattened the economy in March of last year.
The quickening pace of growth, on top of additional large spending packages proposed by President Joe Biden, have raised fears among some analysts that inflation, long quiescent, could rise uncomfortably fast. Raw materials and parts, from lumber to copper to semiconductors, have spiked in price as demand has outstripped the ability of suppliers and shippers to keep up.
Some companies have recently said they plan to raise prices to offset the cost of more expensive supplies. They include the consumer products giants Procter & Gamble and 3M as well as Honeywell, which makes industrial and consumer goods. Powell has said he expects supply bottlenecks to lead to temporary price increases, rather than to a prolonged bout of accelerating inflation.
Under a new framework the Fed adopted last summer, it will no longer raise rates in anticipation of high inflation, which had been its policy for decades. Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they want to see inflation actually exceed their 2% annual inflation target — and not just briefly — before they’d consider raising rates.
They’ve set that goal so that inflation would average 2% over time, to offset the fact that it has been stuck below 2% for nearly the entire past decade. Fed policymakers favor price gains at that level as a cushion against deflation — a prolonged drop in prices and wages that typically makes people and companies reluctant to spend.
One reason Powell has said he thinks the inflation pressures building in the U.S. economy will prove temporary is that, for now, most Americans don’t expect prices to rise much in the long run.
At his news conference, Powell was asked how the Fed would respond if inflation expectations were to increase before the economy had achieved something approximating full employment.
“For inflation to move up in a persistent wait that moves inflation expectations up,” the chairman said, “that would take some time, and you would think it would be quite likely we would be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening.”
Once expectations for inflation do rise, they can be self-fulfilling: Workers start demanding higher pay to offset expected price gains, and retailers begin raising prices to offset increased wages and supply costs. This can set off a wage-price spiral, something the United States last experienced in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Apart from inflation, the Fed’s new framework includes a sweeping definition of maximum employment that includes fully recovering the jobs lost to the pandemic, including among many people of color and low-income workers, before it even considers a rate hike. Powell has also indicated that the Fed would like the roughly 4 million Americans who stopped looking for work after being laid off in the past year to be hired before it considers tightening rates.
The Fed’s policymakers themselves have turned more optimistic about the recovery. Last month, they significantly upgraded their forecasts for growth and inflation. They estimated that the economy will expand 6.5% this year, up sharply from their previous projection in December of 4.2%. And they raised their forecast for inflation by the end of this year from 1.8% to 2.4%.

At the end of a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed, as expected, held interest rates unchanged but did acknowledge the improvement in the U.S. economy.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in remarks after the central bank statement, said it was not the time to talk about tapering its asset purchases. That triggered a further slide in the dollar.
The greenback had rallied in conjunction with the rise in U.S. Treasury yields on the view that a successful vaccination program and strengthening economic data would prompt the Fed to talk about reducing its bond purchases sooner rather than later.
""Powell threw cold water on talking about tapering,"" and that has been the main driver in the move lower in the dollar, said Ron Simpson, managing director, global currency analysis at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
U.S. 10-year yields slipped to 1.618% in the wake of Powell's comments.
""The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy and risks to the economic outlook remain."" read more

The euro rose 0.3% to $1.2126 , while the dollar slipped 0.1% against the Japanese currency to 108.59 yen .
""As it stands, there is nothing here to change our view that the Fed won't begin to taper its monthly asset purchases until the start of next year and won't begin to raise interest rates until late 2023,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note sent after the Fed statement.
Powell also reiterated that the rise in inflation this year was transitory and that would not meet the standard for raising interest rates.
Still, the eurodollar and fed funds markets , which track short-term interest rate expectations, on Wednesday have fully priced Fed tightening in March 2023. Eurodollar futures also show a more than 90% chance of a Fed hike by December 2022.
That was the same expectation before the Fed statement.
""At some point, U.S. inflation will pick up and Powell was very clear about that,"" said Action Economics' Simpson. ""But I don't think it's going to happen overnight and when it does, that's the time when Treasury yields will be moving higher again,"" and the dollar will move higher with them.

In a statement Wednesday, the Fed expressed a brighter outlook, saying the economy has improved along with the job market. And while the policymakers noted that inflation has risen, they ascribed the increase to temporary factors.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is keeping its ultra-low interest rate policies in place, a sign that it wants to see more evidence of a strengthening economic recovery before it would consider easing its support.

The central bank left its benchmark short-term rate near zero, where it's been since the pandemic erupted nearly a year ago, to help keep loan rates down to encourage borrowing and spending. It also said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that it would keep buying $120 billion in bonds each month to try to keep longer-term borrowing rates low.
The U.S. economy has been posting unexpectedly strong gains in recent weeks, with barometers of hiring, spending and manufacturing all surging. Most economists say they detect the early stages of what could be a robust and sustained recovery, with coronavirus case counts declining, vaccinations rising and Americans spending their stimulus-boosted savings.
In March, employers added nearly 1 million jobs — an unheard-of figure before the pandemic. And in April, consumer confidence jumped to its highest level since the pandemic flattened the economy in March of last year.
The quickening pace of growth, on top of additional large spending packages proposed by President Joe Biden, have raised fears among some analysts that inflation, long quiescent, could rise uncomfortably fast. Raw materials and parts, from lumber to copper to semiconductors, have spiked in price as demand has outstripped the ability of suppliers and shippers to keep up.

Some companies have recently said they plan to raise prices to offset the cost of more expensive supplies. They include the consumer products giants Procter & Gamble and 3M as well as Honeywell, which makes industrial and consumer goods. Powell has said he expects supply bottlenecks to lead to temporary price increases, rather than to a prolonged bout of accelerating inflation.
Under a new framework the Fed adopted last summer, it will no longer raise rates in anticipation of high inflation, which had been its policy for decades. Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they want to see inflation actually exceed their 2% annual inflation target — and not just briefly — before they’d consider raising rates.
They’ve set that goal so that inflation would average 2% over time, to offset the fact that it has been stuck below 2% for nearly the entire past decade. Fed policymakers favor price gains at that level as a cushion against deflation — a prolonged drop in prices and wages that typically makes people and companies reluctant to spend.
One reason Powell has said he thinks the inflation pressures building in the U.S. economy will prove temporary is that, for now, most Americans don’t expect prices to rise much in the long run.

Once expectations for inflation do rise, they can be self-fulfilling: Workers start demanding higher pay to offset expected price gains, and retailers begin raising prices to offset increased wages and supply costs. This can set off a wage-price spiral, something the United States last experienced in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Apart from inflation, the Fed’s new framework includes a sweeping definition of maximum employment that includes fully recovering the jobs lost to the pandemic, including among many people of color and low-income workers, before it even considers a rate hike. Powell has also indicated that the Fed would like the roughly 4 million Americans who stopped looking for work after being laid off in the past year to be hired before it considers tightening rates.
The Fed’s policymakers themselves have turned more optimistic about the recovery. Last month, they significantly upgraded their forecasts for growth and inflation. They estimated that the economy will expand 6.5% this year, up sharply from their previous projection in December of 4.2%. And they raised their forecast for inflation by the end of this year from 1.8% to 2.4%.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/28/business/fed-keeps-key-rate-near-zero-sees-inflation-transitory/

FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was down 0.5% at $1,767.76 per ounce by 0131 GMT. U.S. gold futures were down 0.5% at $1,770.00 per ounce. * Palladium fell 0.6% to $2,924.12 per ounce, after hitting an all-time high of $2,962.50 on Tuesday. * Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose to their highest since April 15, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. * The dollar index rose 0.1% against its rivals, making gold less appealing for other currency holders. * Market participants awaited the U.S. Fed's statement due later in the day, for cues on the central bank's monetary policy. * Japanese retail sales rose at the fastest pace in five months in March as consumer demand recovered from the huge hit it took from the COVID-19 pandemic last year. * U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 14-month high in April as increased vaccinations against COVID-19 and additional fiscal stimulus allowed for more services businesses to reopen, boosting demand and hiring by companies. * Analysts and traders have slashed their gold price forecasts, with many believing a return to last year's record highs is unlikely as economic recovery tarnishes the safe-haven metal's appeal, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. * Senior U.S. officials on Tuesday pledged sustained support for India in helping it deal with the world's worst current surge of COVID-19 infections. * Silver fell 0.9% to $26.00 per ounce.

The dollar index stood at 90.968, bouncing from Monday’s low of 90.679, its lowest level since March 3, though investors are not convinced if its downtrend since late March has ended.
The greenback’s decline stemmed largely from receding bets that the Federal Reserve could start laying the ground work for a future policy tightening soon.
On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank is widely expected to maintain its policy settings and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is seen as likely to repeat his dovish message.
But some analysts say signs of rising inflation expectations could nudge the Fed to abandon its rhetoric that a policy tightening is still a long way off.
Investors’ inflation expectations, measured by break-even inflation (BEI) rate calculated from U.S. inflation-linked bonds, rose above 2.40% on Tuesday, the highest level since 2013.
“In a way, the rise in the BEI above 2% is what the Fed has been wishing for. Still, if it goes too far it could raise alarm at the Fed. The Fed will probably not be able to overlook a rise in BEI above 2.5%,” said Makoto Noji, chief FX strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Federal Reserve said last year it aims to bring average inflation around 2% and to allow it to overshoot above 2%, rather than trying to cap it around 2%.
The euro traded at $1.2089, off Monday’s two-month high of $1.2117.
The dollar stood at 108.89 yen, having jumped 0.59% overnight and extending its recovery from a seven-week low of 107.48 touched last week.
The dollar/yen pair edged up in tandem with rises in U.S. bond yields on the back of U.S. inflation expectations.
The yen was on the back foot also as Japan’s economic recovery was hampered by recent surges in COVID-19 cases and after the Bank of Japan acknowledged that inflation will fail to reach its key 2% target through early 2023.
Japan last week declared a third state of emergency for Tokyo, Osaka, and two other prefectures to contain the pandemic, clouding prospects for a fragile recovery and the yen’s outlook.
The Japanese currency slipped even against lower-yielding European currencies, hitting a 2-1/2-year low versus the euro, at 131.515 per euro and a five-year low on the Swiss franc, at 119.20 per franc.
Besides the Fed, investors are looking to U.S. President Joe Biden’s first address to a joint session of Congress, also scheduled later on Wednesday.
Biden is expected to roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including the largest-ever increase in levies on investment gains, to fund about $1 trillion in childcare.
News reports about his tax-hike plan dented markets’ risk appetite only briefly on Friday but analysts think there could be a bigger reaction if the plan becomes more concrete.
“In addition to tax policies that have resurfaced as a market focus, his stance on diplomacy should attract some attention given recent tensions with China and Russia,” said Shinichiro Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays.
