32,"But even if such a move was delayed until December or January, it wouldn't matter much to markets, which have already priced in a policy change, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in emailed comments."

34,"Taper time

36,It's the Fed's job to keep prices stable and achieve maximum employment.

39,"""For me it would not take a knock-out great [September] employment report,"" Powell added, even though other members of the policy committee still wanted to see further improvements."
40,Investors have long expected the Fed to clamp down on its monthly stimulus as the recovery was coming along nicely over the summer.

50,"The growth rate for 2022, however, was revised upwards to 3.8% from 3.3%."
51,"Similarly, the Fed now expects unemployment to be slightly higher -- at 4.8% -- than previously thought at the end of this year."

85,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to clear the way on Wednesday for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year and show in updated projections whether higher-than-expected inflation or a resurgent coronavirus pandemic is weighing more on the economic outlook.

87,"Graeme Jennings/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo
 Fed policymakers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July - signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation - and been conflicted among themselves about how to react."
88,"Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year."
89,"But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the “taper” might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created."
90,"The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome."
91,"The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the “substantial further progress” the Fed has said it wants to see in the labor market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis."
92,"While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May."
93,"Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well, and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be “conditional on a solid September employment gain.”
 The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic."
94,More then 60% of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December.
95,"Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program."
96,"Financial markets have been roiled in the last week by concerns about spillover effects from the potential collapse of a large Chinese property developer, China Evergrande Group, and the S&P 500 index kicked off the week with its largest daily loss in four months."
97,"Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers appear no closer to resolving a partisan standoff in Congress over lifting the federal debt ceiling, with the potential for a partial shutdown of the federal government rising by the day."
98,"INFLATION WATCH
 When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates."
99,"Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed’s Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates."
100,It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
101,"Policymakers’ new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials penciling in an initial increase for next year."
102,The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2% on an annualized basis.
103,"That is double the central bank’s 2% target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank’s new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates."
104,Leaning in the other direction: The surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
105,"Since June, when the Fed noted the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and said the economy’s performance appeared to be separating from the pandemic, the seven-day average of new daily infections had ballooned five-fold to 66,000 by the central bank’s July 27-28 meeting."
106,It has roughly doubled again since then.
107,"Some measures of service activity have dipped, prompting forecasters to mark down their outlooks for economic growth this year."
108,The Fed may well follow suit.

 Property giant and Asia’s biggest junk bond issuer Evergrande said it “resolved” one payment due on Thursday via a private negotiation, easing concerns of default and possible contagion risk, while the People’s Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan into the banking system to support markets."
132,"“Being able to make tomorrow’s bond coupon payment, that definitely lifted risk sentiment overnight and you saw a typical follow-through reaction in risk currencies, so Canadian dollar high, Aussie dollar higher, Kiwi dollar higher - that was kind of an understandable reaction,” said Erik Bregar, an independent FX analyst in Toronto."

135,The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback at 6.4628 per dollar.
136,All eyes will be on the Fed later in the session for its policy announcement for signs of when the U.S. central bank plans to begin trimming its monthly asset purchases as well as any insight into the timing of a possible rate hike.
137,"“There is definitely a more clear consensus going into this meeting, vis-a-vis the previous one, people are looking for a more clear timeline on taper, we have all heard these expectations about a signal to start in November then the actual pace of purchase start declining in September, you could argue expectations are a tad hawkish coming in,” Bregar said."

 The Federal Reserve is expected to clear the way on Wednesday for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year and show in updated projections whether higher-than-expected inflation or a resurgent coronavirus pandemic is weighing more on the economic outlook."
231,"Fed policy-makers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July – signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation – and been conflicted among themselves about how to react."
232,"Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120-billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year."
233,"Story continues below advertisement
 But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the “taper” might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created."
234,"The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome."
235,"The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the “substantial further progress” the Fed has said it wants to see in the labour market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis."
236,"While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May."
237,"Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well, and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be “conditional on a solid September employment gain.”
 The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic."
238,More than 60 per cent of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December.
239,"Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program."

242,"INFLATION WATCH
 When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates."
243,"Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed’s Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates."
244,It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
245,"Policy-makers’ new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials pencilling in an initial increase for next year."
246,The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2 per cent on an annualized basis.
247,"That is double the central bank’s 2 per cent target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank’s new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates."

335,"Image The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, has been carefully telegraphing the central bank’s progress toward the so-called taper, in hopes that the Fed can avoid surprising and roiling markets."
336,"Credit... Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters
 The Federal Reserve is finishing up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and officials are expected to signal that they will soon slow their large bond-buying program — the central bank’s first step in weaning the economy off the support it has offered since shortly after the pandemic began."
337,This Fed meeting is shaping up to be among the most closely watched of the year.
338,"Central bank officials are in the process of teeing up their plans to slow large-scale purchases of government-backed debt, which they have been using to keep longer-term interest rates low and many types of borrowing cheap."
339,"The Fed has been carefully broadcasting its progress toward the so-called taper, in hopes that it can avoid surprising and roiling markets."
340,Officials could provide further details on the expected timing and pace.
341,The Fed — which will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. — will also provide fresh economic projections.
342,"Those will include policymakers’ predictions of when they might lift their main interest rate from near-zero, a move that officials have signaled is still months or even years away."
343,"“The Fed has been very clear on their intentions,” said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, noting that officials want to get moving on the bond program so that they can separate it from the path ahead for the federal funds rate."
344,"“That’s one of the reasons they want to get the taper underway — they just want it on the back burner.”
 Most economists expect the Fed to formally announce the tapering plan at its November meeting, and few expect officials to signal a precise timeline this week."
345,"Instead, they will probably say that they hope to slow bond purchases before the end of the year, and may offer hints about how quickly the purchases will draw to a close."
346,"“Their goal is just to keep inching toward the taper,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities."
347,"“Why pre-commit yourself?” Indeed, there’s a reason for all the tiptoeing."
348,"In 2013, when a former Fed Chair suggested that a post-financial-crisis bond purchase program would slow, it roiled global markets in what became known as the “taper tantrum.” Jerome H. Powell, the current Fed chair, has managed to avoid a similar fate so far, but the stakes right now are particularly high."
349,Markets have been rocky this week as investors have fretted about stress in China’s real estate sector and the Fed’s plans.
350,"That risk is probably not enough to dissuade central bankers from sticking to the course they have charted, economists said."
351,"“It’s taken some effort to get Fed officials all on the same page, and to get the Fed and the markets on the same page,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said in an email Monday."
352,“I’d be surprised if they want to upend that for something that may be fleeting.” The Fed is also wrestling with more long-lasting questions about the economic outlook.
353,"Inflation has been elevated this year as the economy has begun to reopen from the pandemic and supply has struggled to keep pace with rapid consumer demand, and some measures of consumer inflation expectations are creeping higher."
354,"If that continues, rapid price gains could become more permanent."
355,That would run counter to one of the Fed’s two main goals.
356,The central bank is in charge of keeping inflation low and steady — it aims for 2 percent annual increases in prices on average over time — while fostering maximum employment.
357,But full employment also remains elusive.
358,"Millions of jobs are still missing, even after months of historically rapid employment gains, and officials want to avoid lifting interest rates to cool off the economy before the labor market has fully healed."
