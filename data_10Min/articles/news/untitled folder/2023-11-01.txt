The Federal Reserve is widely predicted to leave rates steady for a second consecutive meeting, but not to rule out another increase in the coming months.
Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will announce their latest decision on interest rates on Wednesday, and although they are expected to keep rates steady, their assessment of the economy often moves markets, with implications for borrowers and savers.
The Fed last raised its benchmark rate, the federal funds rate, in July to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent. A series of rate increases that began in March last year was intended to rein in inflation, which has cooled but remains elevated, leading Fed officials to suggest that they will keep rates high for a prolonged period of time.
That means the cost of credit cards and mortgages may remain relatively high, making it more difficult for people who want to pay down debt — as well as those who want to take out new loans to renovate their kitchen or buy a new car. In recent weeks, the long-term market rates that influence many types of consumer and business loans have drifted higher, even as the Fed left its key rate on hold.
“We were very spoiled for a while with low rates, and that lulled us into a false sense of security in terms of what the true cost of debt can be,” said Anna N’Jie-Konte, president of Re-Envision Wealth, a wealth management firm.
Here’s how different rates are affected by the Fed’s decisions — and where they stand now.
Credit Cards
Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, which means consumers with revolving debt have seen those rates rise over the past year — and quickly (increases usually occur within one or two billing cycles).
The average credit card rate was 20.72 percent as of Oct. 25, according to Bankrate.com, up from around 16 percent in March last year, when the Fed began its series of rate increases.
People carrying credit card debt should focus on paying it down and assume rates will continue to rise. Zero-percent balance transfer offers can help when used carefully (they still exist for people with good credit, but come with fees), or you might try negotiating a lower rate with your card issuer, said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. His research found that such a tactic often works.
Car Loans
Higher loan rates have been dampening auto sales, particularly in the used-car market, because loans are more expensive and prices remain high, experts said. Qualifying for car loans has also become more challenging than it was a year ago.
“The vehicle market has challenges with affordability,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm.
The average rate on new car loans in September was 7.4 percent, up slightly from the start of the year, according to Edmunds.com. Used-car rates were even higher: The average loan carried an 11.4 percent rate in September, matching a high set earlier in the year.
Car loans tend to track the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate — but that’s not the only factor that determines how much you’ll pay. A borrower’s credit history, the type of vehicle, loan term and down payment are all baked into that rate calculation.
Mortgages
Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark rate, but instead generally track the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations around inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react to all of it.
Mortgage rates are running at the highest levels in more than two decades. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 7.79 percent as of Oct. 26, according to Freddie Mac, compared with 6.7 percent for an identical loan the same week in 2022.
Other home loans are more closely tethered to the Fed’s moves. Home-equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages — which each carry variable interest rates — generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed’s rates. The average rate on a home-equity loan was 8.88 percent as of Oct. 25, according to Bankrate.com, up from 7.3 percent a year ago.
Student Loans
Borrowers who already hold federal student loans are not affected by the Fed’s actions because that debt carries a fixed rate set by the government. (Payments on most of these loans have been paused for the past three years as part of a pandemic relief measure, and became due again in October.)
But batches of new federal student loans are priced each July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May. And those loan rates have climbed: Borrowers with federal undergraduate loans disbursed after July 1 (and before July 1, 2024) will pay 5.5 percent, up from 4.99 percent for loans disbursed in the year-earlier period. Just three years ago, rates were below 3 percent.
Graduate students taking out federal loans will also pay about half a point more than the rate a year earlier, or about 7.05 percent on average, as will parents, at 8.05 percent on average.
Borrowers of private student loans have already seen those rates climb thanks to the prior increases. Both fixed- and variable-rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate.
Savings Vehicles
Savers seeking a better return on their money have had an easier time: Rates on online savings accounts, along with one-year certificates of deposit, have reached their highest levels in more than a decade. But the pace of those increases is slowing.
“Consumers now have several options to earn over 5 percent yield on their cash,” said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, part of LendingTree.
A higher Fed rate often means that banks pay more interest on their deposits, though it does not always happen right away. They tend to raise their rates when they want to bring more money in.
The average yield on an online savings account was 4.4 percent as of Oct. 1, according to DepositAccounts.com, up from 2.1 percent a year ago. But yields on money market funds offered by brokerage firms are even more alluring because they have tracked the federal funds rate more closely. The yield on the Crane 100 Money Fund Index, which tracks the largest money market funds, was recently 5.19 percent.
Rates on certificates of deposit, which tend to track similarly dated Treasury securities, have also been ticking higher. The average one-year C.D. at online banks was 5.18 percent as of Oct. 1, up from 3.15 percent a year earlier, according to DepositAccounts.com.


U.S. stocks on Wednesday rose ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision
U.S. stocks on Wednesday rose ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision. Equities extended their gains from the last two days of October into the new month, as markets continued their rebound from correction territory.
Meanwhile, bonds rallied after the U.S. Treasury announced a quarterly long-term debt sales amount that came in lower than expected.
By mid-day, the Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) led the three major averages, rising 0.74% to 12,946.92 points. The tech-heavy index got a boost from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which surged after touting more than $2B in sales next year from its artificial intelligence MI300 chip.
The S&P 500 (SP500) was higher by 0.59% to 4,218.72 points. The index notched a three-month losing streak on Halloween yesterday, its longest such slide since the first quarter of 2020. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) gained 0.38% to 33,180.11 points.
Among other earnings-related moves, Generac (GNRC) was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 (SP500), after the maker of backup generators and solar equipment beat quarterly estimates.
Conversely, online payroll services and HR software solutions provider Paycom Software (PAYC) plummeted nearly 40% and was the top S&P percentage loser. The stock drew several analyst downgrades after disappointing quarterly guidance. Estée Lauder (EL) was another top loser, with shares slumping about 16%. The cosmetics company - which owns brands such as Aramis and Bobbi Brown - cut its full year outlook due to Asia headwinds.
The earnings season will not be the main highlight of the day, however, with all eyes on the Fed's upcoming monetary policy decision. Traders widely anticipate the central bank to hold steady on interest rates.
"The biggest market mover is likely to be any hint that Fed Chair Powell provides on whether the last 2023 hike in the Summary of Economic Projections is on or off the table," Standard Chartered's Steve Englander said. "The December FOMC has only 6bps priced in, so making it 'live' rather than dormant would be a surprise."
"A strong hint that the FOMC will hold in December would probably be read as signaling that the hiking cycle is over. However, with two CPI and labor releases between the 1 November and 13 December FOMC meetings, he is unlikely to lean strongly either way," Englander added.
A busy economic calendar also jostled for attention. There was mixed data on the labor market, with ADP's jobs report showing a lesser-than-expected rise in private employment in October. However, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for September showed a higher-than-anticipated rise in job openings.
Manufacturing data was similarly mixed, with S&P Global's gauge of U.S. manufacturing conditions inching up in October and matching estimates, but ISM's reading of economic activity in the sector for the same month contracting.
Turning to the fixed-income markets, Treasury yields were lower as investors snapped up bonds. The moves came after the U.S. Treasury's latest quarterly refunding announcement showed a slowing in the pace of increase in sales of long-term debt. The Treasury said it would sell $112B of longer-term 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities at its quarterly refunding auctions next week, below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $114B.
The 30-year Treasury yield (US30Y) was down 6 basis points to 4.96%, while the 10-year yield (US10Y) was down 7 basis points to 4.80%. The shorter-end more rate-sensitive 2-year yield (US2Y) was down 6 basis points to 5.01%.

Global stock indexes were higher and the U.S. dollar was nearly flat on Wednesday ahead of the afternoon's Federal Reserve's policy decision, while Treasury yields slipped on Treasury Department plans to "gradually" boost the size of its debt auctions to meet financing needs.
Global stock indexes were higher and the U.S. dollar was nearly flat on Wednesday ahead of the afternoon's Federal Reserve's policy decision, while Treasury yields slipped on Treasury Department plans to "gradually" boost the size of its debt auctions to meet financing needs. The Treasury Department said the size of most auctions from November to January 2024 will increase and that it will need one additional quarter of increases to meet its funding plans.
With the U.S. central bank widely expected to hold rates steady, investors will closely monitor Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech to gauge where interest rates are headed and how long they will stay higher. Data showed a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. private payrolls, which took some steam out of a still-tight labor market.
Private payrolls rose by 113,000 jobs and data for September was unrevised to show an 89,000 addition, as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls rising 150,000 last month. "For now, the Fed is very much in wait and see mode," said Niall O'Sullivan, chief investment officer, multi-asset strategies EMEA, at Neuberger Berman.
The Japanese yen recovered somewhat on Wednesday after falling sharply the day before, when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) tweaked its bond yield control policy, loosening its grip on long-term rates and pushing the currency to a one-year low against the dollar. That was followed by a fresh and sterner warning from Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Wednesday that authorities stood ready to respond to recent "one-sided, sharp" moves in the currency.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.47% versus the greenback at 150.96 per dollar. The U.S. dollar index was last up 0.07%.
On Wall Street, megacap stocks gained as bond yields eased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 162.73 points, or 0.49%, to 33,215.6; the S&P 500 gained 30.21 points, or 0.72%, to 4,224.01; and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.09 points, or 0.83%, to 12,958.33.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.83% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.78%. Japan's Nikkei rose about 2% as investors remained on red alert for yen-buying intervention from authorities.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 0.4 basis point to 4.871%. Oil prices gained ahead of the Fed decision, with investors also keeping a close eye on the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict.
U.S. crude recently rose 2.41% to $82.97 per barrel and Brent was at $86.95, up 2.27% on the day. Earlier data Wednesday showed Asia's manufacturers faced worsening pressure in October with factory activity in China slipping back into decline, clouding recovery prospects for the region's major exporters already squeezed by weaker global demand and higher prices.

Employers posted 9.6 million job openings in September, up from 9.5 million in August and a sign that the US job market remains strong even as the Federal Reserve attempts to cool the economy.
Employers posted 9.6 million job openings in September, up from a revised 9.5 million in August and a sign that the US job market remains strong even as the Federal Reserve attempts to cool the economy.
Layoffs fell to 1.5 million from 1.7 million in August, more evidence that workers enjoy an unusual degree of job security. The number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence they can find better pay elsewhere — was virtually unchanged.
The September openings are down from a record 12 million in March 2022 but remain high by historical standards. Before 2021 — when the American economy began to surge from the COVID-19 pandemic — monthly job openings had never topped 8 million. Unemployment was 3.8% in September, just a couple of ticks above a half-century low.
Openings were up by 141,000 at hotels and restaurants, which have struggled to attract and keep workers since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020.
The Federal Reserve’s inflation fighters would like to see the job market cool. They worry that strong hiring pressures employers into raising wages — and trying to pass the higher costs along with price increases that feed inflation.

The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 in an effort to contain inflation that hit a four-decade high in 2022. In September, consumer prices were up 3.7% from a year earlier, down from a peak of 9.1% in June last year but still above the Fed’s 2% target.
The combination of sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth, and decelerating inflation has raised hopes the Fed can pull off a so-called soft landing — raising rates just enough to contain price increases without tipping the economy into recession. The central bank is expected to announce later Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged for the second straight meeting as it waits to assess the fallout from its earlier rate hikes.
On Friday, the Labor Department releases its jobs report for October. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet expect that US employers added a solid 189,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate stayed at 3.8%.

The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it announces its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon.
The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates in a range on 5.25%-5.50% at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday, though possibly keep the door open to further rate hikes in the coming months.
The Fed in July raised rates to a 22-year high as it continued the most aggressive rate-hiking campaign in four decades. Its updated economic forecasts released in September suggested one additional rate hike would be needed this year to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
The Fed will announce its monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET Wednesday followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 pm ET.
Powell signaled in a speech at the Economic Club of New York last month the central bank could hold rates steady at its November policy meeting. The Fed chair also warned, however, that inflation was still too high and more rate increases are still possible if the economy stays surprisingly hot.
"Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully," Powell said.
Officials are now trying to determine whether they've raised rates enough that holding them at these levels for sometime would bring inflation back to target.

"While there isn't an expectation for a rate increase at [this] week's Fed meeting, the FOMC will acknowledge the underlying strength of the economy given a still-resilient labor market," LPL Financial strategist Quincy Krosby said. "They may find it appropriate to suggest that financial conditions are still not tight enough to quell consumer spending."
Last week, the first estimate of third quarter GDP showed growth clocked in at a whopping 4.9% annualized rate over the summer months, driven in large part by strong consumer spending, punctuated by a surge in retail sales in September.
But new spending data out for September showed consumers are spending more than they are earning.
Adjusted for inflation, consumers increased spending in each of the last three months while real disposable income fell over the same period, raising the question of how much longer spending could last at these levels.
Story continues
With no new interest rate projections or economic forecasts released this meeting, all eyes will be on Powell and his comments on the outlook for monetary policy.
Powell, speaking on October 19, noted that the economy is a story of "much stronger demand" and that it "may just be that rates haven't been high enough for long enough."
The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — "core" PCE — showed prices rose 0.3% over the prior month in September, the most in four months, while annual price increases slowed modestly to 3.7% from 3.8% in August.
The 3.7% is in line where officials expected inflation to end the year, offering the prospect inflation could be lower than officials thought by the end of this year.
Powell has also said that the central bank is closely watching a recent surge in long-term bond yields; other Fed officials have said recently that if long-term interest rates remain elevated there may be less need for the Fed to act.

The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates in a range on 5.25%-5.50% at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday, though possibly keep the door open to further rate hikes in the coming months.
The Fed in July raised rates to a 22-year high as it continued the most aggressive rate-hiking campaign in four decades. Its updated economic forecasts released in September suggested one additional rate hike would be needed this year to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
The Fed will announce its monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET Wednesday followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 pm ET.
Powell signaled in a speech at the Economic Club of New York last month the central bank could hold rates steady at its November policy meeting. The Fed chair also warned, however, that inflation was still too high and more rate increases are still possible if the economy stays surprisingly hot.
"Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully," Powell said.
Officials are now trying to determine whether they've raised rates enough that holding them at these levels for sometime would bring inflation back to target.

"While there isn't an expectation for a rate increase at [this] week's Fed meeting, the FOMC will acknowledge the underlying strength of the economy given a still-resilient labor market," LPL Financial strategist Quincy Krosby said. "They may find it appropriate to suggest that financial conditions are still not tight enough to quell consumer spending."
Last week, the first estimate of third quarter GDP showed growth clocked in at a whopping 4.9% annualized rate over the summer months, driven in large part by strong consumer spending, punctuated by a surge in retail sales in September.
But new spending data out for September showed consumers are spending more than they are earning.
Adjusted for inflation, consumers increased spending in each of the last three months while real disposable income fell over the same period, raising the question of how much longer spending could last at these levels.
Story continues
With no new interest rate projections or economic forecasts released this meeting, all eyes will be on Powell and his comments on the outlook for monetary policy.
Powell, speaking on October 19, noted that the economy is a story of "much stronger demand" and that it "may just be that rates haven't been high enough for long enough."
The Fed's preferred inflation gauge — "core" PCE — showed prices rose 0.3% over the prior month in September, the most in four months, while annual price increases slowed modestly to 3.7% from 3.8% in August.
The 3.7% is in line where officials expected inflation to end the year, offering the prospect inflation could be lower than officials thought by the end of this year.
Powell has also said that the central bank is closely watching a recent surge in long-term bond yields; other Fed officials have said recently that if long-term interest rates remain elevated there may be less need for the Fed to act.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are drifting as Wall Street waits to hear what will come out of the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement on interest rates. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% early Wednesday, coming off its third straight losing month largely because of higher yields in the bond market. The Dow was little changed, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.3%. The Fed is wrapping up its latest meeting on interest-rate policy in the afternoon. The overwhelming expectation is for it to hold its main rate steady for the second straight time. It’s already yanked the overnight rate above 5.25% from nearly zero early last year.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Wall Street futures retreated early as markets remained cautious ahead of another full slate of corporate earnings and a decision on interest rates Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Futures for the Dow slipped 0.4% before the bell and futures for the S&P fell 0.5%.
For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for. Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust.
However, Powell and his colleagues at the Fed have not taken the possibility of another rate hike off the table.
The Fed has already pulled its main overnight interest rate above 5.25% to its highest level since 2001. Officials at the U.S. central bank have been saying it will make upcoming moves based on what data say about inflation and the job market, where the worry is that too-strong growth could give inflation more fuel.
In premarket equities trading, CVS Health dipped about 1% after it posted better-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit but trimmed its adjusted per-share earnings expectations for the year.
Airbnb and DoorDash release their latest financial results after the bell, with Apple, Starbucks and a slew of others reporting Thursday.
Oil prices were higher as Israeli airstrikes leveled apartment buildings in Gaza and ground troops battled Hamas militants inside the besieged territory. In recent days, Israeli troops have advanced toward the outskirts of Gaza City from the north and east. Worries that fighting could escalate beyond the latest Israel-Hamas war, potentially disrupting supplies, have roiled oil markets in recent weeks.
U.S. benchmark crude oil advanced $1.55 early Wednesday to $82.57 a barrel. It lost 29 cents on Tuesday to $81.02. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up $1.55 to $86.57 a barrel.
Germany's DAX and the CAC 40 in Paris gained less than 0.1% while Britain's FTSE 100 ticked down less than 0.2%.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index added 2.4% to 31,601.65 a day after the Bank of Japan held back from any major changes to its near-zero interest rate policy, though it adjusted its controls on government bond yields.
The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at 151.22 yen. The euro fell to $1.0543 from $1.0575.
The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 4.88% early Wednesday from 4.92% late Tuesday.
Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong, the Hang Seng edged less than 0.1% higher, to 17,101.78. The Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1% to 3,023.08.
South Korea's Kospi advanced 1% to 2,301.56 and the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9% to 6,838.30.
Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.
More than 80% of the stocks in the S&P 500 strengthened. It closed October with a loss of 2.2% for the month. That’s its third straight monthly drop, the longest losing streak since the COVID-19 pandemic froze the global economy at the start of 2020.
Higher bond yields have taken a toll, since they knock down prices for stocks and other investments, while slowing the overall economy and adding pressure on the entire financial system. The 10-year Treasury yield, which is the centerpiece of the bond market, has jumped from less than 3.50% during the spring to more than 5% recently, touching its highest level since 2007.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he sees no reason to change the current drawdown of the central bank's still-massive balance sheet.

NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he sees no reason to change the current drawdown of the central bank's still-massive balance sheet.
The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee "is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff. It's not something we're talking about or considering," Powell said at a press conference.
While shrinking Fed holdings may have a small impact on real world borrowing costs, "I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point."
Powell spoke on the state of the central bank's holdings of cash and bonds after a meeting in which officials again held their overnight interest rate target range steady at between 5.25% and 5.5%, the same level it's been since the end of July. Fed officials have kept alive the prospect they may raise rates again and Powell said decisions on the fed funds rate would be made "meeting by meeting."

But Powell also acknowledged in his press conference that when it comes to rate rises the central bank is probably "close to the end of the cycle." A potential end to rate hikes has fueled a debate on whether the Fed should also consider winding down the process of allowing just shy of $100 billion per month in Treasury and mortgage bonds it owns to mature and not be replaced.
The Fed is trying to reduce the size of its holdings to withdraw the liquidity it added during the coronavirus pandemic crisis, which caused the size of Fed holdings to more than double to a peak of just shy of $9 trillion last summer.

Fed officials have said repeatedly that the balance sheet drawdown effort complements rate rises and runs in the background. But an increasing number of market participants are speculating the process could end sooner than some in the Fed may think.
The key, in the view of some, is the rapid decline in the Fed's reverse repo facility, which allows money market funds and others to park cash at the Fed. This Fed tool is viewed as a proxy for excess and easy to remove liquidity and it has fallen rapidly over recent weeks. After an extended stay of over $2 trillion per day in inflows, it's been hovering just above $1 trillion in recent days.

Some in the Fed as well as some private sector analysts believe that when the reverse repo facility has drained fully or stabilizes, reserve levels will begin to fall, which will then open the door to an end to the drawdown process.
The Fed wants reserves at a high enough level to ensure solid market liquidity levels and firm central bank control over short-term interest rates. In recent comments, Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, said she believes the balance sheet run-off can run for an additional year and a half to two years.

For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign.
The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust. A widely predicted recession hasn’t materialized.
But the deceleration of inflation has slowed, and solid economic growth could keep inflation elevated or even send it higher. As a result, Powell and other Fed officials aren’t yet willing to take a final rate hike off the table. At a new conference Wednesday, Powell will likely highlight the progress the central bank has made while still underscoring that inflation remains too high and that future rate hikes might be needed to finish the job of slowing inflation to the Fed’s 2 per cent target.
“The Fed has to talk tough on inflation,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “They have no other choice if they want to keep their inflation-fighting credibility intact.”.
Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its key rate from near zero to roughly 5.4 per cent in its effort to tame inflation, which reached a four-decade high in 2022 as the economy roared out of the pandemic recession. The costs of mortgages, auto loans and credit card debt have all risen in response. Annual inflation, as measured by the government’s consumer price index, has sunk from a 9.1 per cent peak in June of last year to 3.7 per cent.
Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low.
On the other hand, turbulent financial markets have sent longer-term rates on U.S. Treasurys surging, driven stock prices lower and raised corporate borrowing costs. Several of the Fed’s policy-makers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown – and, in process, ease inflation pressures – without the need for further rate hikes.
Economists at Wall Street banks have estimated that sharp losses in the stock market and higher bond yields over the past few months will have a depressive effect on the economy equal to the impact of three or four quarter-point rate hikes by the Fed.
“It’s clearly a tightening in financial conditions,” Powell said this month. “That’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve.”
Though the Fed has raised its benchmark rate to a 22-year high, it hasn’t imposed any hikes since July. Even so, the yield – or interest rate – on the 10-year Treasury note has kept rising, touching 5 per cent last week, a level it hadn’t reached in 16 years. The surge in Treasury yields has caused the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to reach nearly 8 per cent.
Market analysts say an array of factors have combined to force up Treasury yields. For one thing, the government is expected to sell potentially trillions of dollars more in bonds in the coming years to finance huge and persistent budget deficits even as the Fed is shrinking its holdings of bonds. As a result, higher Treasury rates may be needed to attract more buyers.
And with the future path of rates murkier than usual, investors are demanding higher yields in return for the greater risk of holding longer-term bonds.
What’s important for the Fed is that the yield on the 10-year Treasury has continued to zoom higher even without rate hikes by the central bank. That suggests that Treasury yields may stay high even if the Fed keeps its own benchmark rate on hold, helping keep a lid on economic growth and inflation.
Powell has said the central bank can “proceed carefully” as it weighs the impact of the tighter credit on the healthy economy. And Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board, said last month, “I believe we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive moves” on interest rates.
Wall Street traders foresee a 97 per cent probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. And they envision only a 29 per cent chance of a rate hike at the Fed’s following meeting in December.

Washington, DC CNN —
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second consecutive meeting, leaving the central bank’s benchmark lending rate at its highest level in 22 years.
Economists and financial markets had expected the pause in the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, after several Fed officials signaled they anticipate a further slowing of the US economy as it continues to absorb the effects of higher borrowing costs.
The Fed’s post-meeting statement noted that “economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter” — a recent development that has puzzled some economists.
Despite the Fed aggressively raising interest rates 11 times since March 2022 in a bid to combat inflation, the US economy has not only avoided a recession so far, but instead expanded at a blistering 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter, mostly due to solid consumer spending.
The importance of bond yields
The economy’s surprising resilience is one reason behind the recent run-up in bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hovering near the 5% threshold — though it dipped below 4.8% Wednesday morning after the Treasury Department said it would auction a slightly smaller amount of debt than investors expected.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference that the central bank is keeping a close eye on soaring bond yields, which “could matter for future rate decisions.”
“Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months,” Powell said. “Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.”
While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target. A red-hot economy could make the proverbial final mile of the Fed’s historic inflation fight more difficult, and possibly undo some of the welcome progress it has seen over the past year. But it’s unlikely that the third quarter’s robust economic strength will persist, simply because it was an anomaly. In the five years ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic, from 2014 to 2019, GDP growth averaged 2.6%, according to Commerce Department data.
US stocks jumped higher on Wednesday afternoon with the Dow rising 221 points, or 0.7%; the S&P 500 hitting a session high, up 1.1%; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 1.6% higher.
Looking for ‘below-trend growth’
Fed officials have said they need to see consistent “below-trend growth” to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%, since red-hot demand could be maintaining some upward pressure on prices.
“Everyone’s been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of a rate-hiking cycle like this one,” Powell said.
The Fed chief stressed that it “is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely” that the central bank would need to see weaker growth and a softer job market to “fully restore price stability.” It’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown. Defeating inflation without a sharp rise in unemployment would be known as a “soft landing” — and some officials are hopeful for that outcome.
The good news for the Fed is that the economy is widely expected to lose some steam under the weight of higher borrowing costs due to elevated yields, tighter budgets due to the resumption of student loan repayments, depleted pandemic savings and other economic hurdles Americans are facing.
For now, the bond-market rout is playing an important role in cooling the economy, according to public remarks from several Fed officials. The Fed’s several past policy statements have all mentioned that tighter credit conditions will likely weigh on both inflation and the broader economy, but Wednesday’s statement included “financial” conditions in that usual sentence.
All eyes on the job market
Officials are also paying close attention to hiring, wages and labor demand. A weaker job market would be well received by the Fed, since it would beget similarly weaker consumption. Softer job market conditions would also mean employers feel less pressure to jack up wages to recruit talent, which could be passed on to consumers, though the extent of wage growth fueling inflation is debated among economists.
The Employment Cost Index, a broad measure of employers’ labor costs, accelerated slightly in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, but continued to slow on a year-over-year basis over the past few quarters. Powell said he’s pleased to see that trend.
“Wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months, where they are substantially closer to a level that would be consistent with 2% inflation over time,” Powell said. Though he noted that “it’s not the case that wages have been the principal driver of inflation so far.”
Similar to growth forecasts, economists are also expecting the job market to loosen in the coming months, which could help facilitate slower inflation.
“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note.
“Looking ahead, we foresee softer labor market conditions with further hiring freezes and strategic resizing decisions along with some continued moderation in nominal wage growth,” she wrote.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases October data gauging the US job market Friday, including monthly job growth, wage gains and the unemployment rate.


The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged in its policy decision, due later in the day
Subdued stocks inched higher on Wednesday ahead of a policy decision from the Federal Reserve later in the day, while the yen was stuck near one-year lows against the dollar as Tokyo ramped up intervention warnings.
Europe’s benchmark STOXX index rose 0.46%, more positive than the 0.1% gain in MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan which has clocked three straight months of losses.
Japan’s Nikkei was 2% higher as investors remained on red alert for yen-buying intervention from authorities to try to scrape the currency off the floor after recent central bank policy tweaks failed to reverse its recent losses.
The spotlight on Wednesday will meanwhile firmly be on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, with the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady.
Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized to gauge where interest rates are headed and how long they will stay higher.
Erik Weisman, chief economist and portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management, said the Fed would keep the option of future rate hikes firmly on the table until the labour market cools considerably and inflationary pressures ease.
“Chairman Powell will also argue that the lagged effects of past hikes have not fully impacted the economy and that patience is prudent,” Weisman said.
Markets are pricing in a 29% chance of a 25 basis point hike in December and a 35% chance of a 25 bps hike in January, the CME FedWatch tool showed.
U.S. stocks looked set for a shakier start on Wednesday, with S&P e-mini futures, NASDAQ futures and DOW futures all down around 0.21%.
Treasury yields remained elevated, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up 4 basis points to 4.914%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was up 5.3 basis points to 5.077%. [US/]
The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 0.8 basis points at 5.079%.
Claudio Irigoyen, global head of economics at BofA Global Research, said the most important question for the next three to five years in the discussion about U.S. fiscal policy is whether interest rates will go back to pre-pandemic levels.
“Or if this is a new regime of higher real interest rates,” Irigoyen said. “And I think that I am more on the camp of the second option.”
YEN VIGIL
Market focus in Asia was firmly on the yen in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s decision to tweak its bond yield control policy again on Tuesday, further loosening its grip on long-term interest rates.
The move drove a broad slide in the yen on Tuesday, sending it tumbling to a one-year low against the dollar and touching a 15-year low against the euro as investors had expected a bigger BOJ step towards ending years of massive monetary stimulus.
“The market has seen the tweak to a flexible regime as clear dovish development,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
“Once again market players have been left frustrated by the lack of urgency shown by the BOJ, and either closed yen longs or flipped into outright yen shorts.”
The sharp drop in the yen prompted a fresh and sterner warning from Japan’s top currency diplomat Masato Kanda that authorities were on standby to respond to recent “one-sided, sharp” moves in the currency.
The yen strengthened 0.24% to 151.31 per dollar following the comments but remained close to one-year lows of 151.74 it hit on Tuesday and the three-decade low of 151.94 touched last year, which triggered an intervention by Tokyo at the time.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was up 0.12% at 106.79. Sterling was last at $1.2151, down 0.2% on the day.
Data on Wednesday showed Asia’s manufacturers faced worsening pressure in October with factory activity in China slipping back into decline, clouding recovery prospects for the region’s major exporters already squeezed by weaker global demand and higher prices.
Oil prices rose ahead of the Fed decision, with the market keeping a close eye on the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict, as geopolitical risks offset record production levels in the U.S.
U.S. crude rose 0.43% to $81.45 per barrel and Brent was at $85.55, up 0.62% on the day.

A surging economy has complicated the Fed's fight to cool price increases.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, despite stubborn inflation that has resisted the central bank's fight to cool price increases.
The move allows previous rate increases to take greater hold of the economy and grants the central bank time to assess whether another hike will be necessary.
Once bemoaned as a source of recession worries, the U.S. economy has become a wellspring of good news: blistering growth, robust hiring and consumers opening their wallets for everything from concert tickets to bar tabs.
The strong performance complicates the fight to dial back inflation, posing a quandary for the Fed.
Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand.
In theory, the economy should eventually falter as it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. But the economy has so far resisted a cooldown.
Inflation stands well below its peak last year of over 9%, but progress has stalled in recent months and price growth remains more than a percentage point higher than the central bank's target rate.
Gross domestic product data released last week showed that the U.S. economy expanded at a 4.9% annualized rate over three months ending in September. That breakneck pace more than doubled growth over the previous quarter and reinforced other recent indicators of sturdy performance.
A blockbuster jobs report last month exceeded economist expectations by nearly twofold. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity, surged in September, government data showed.
Speaking at a luncheon in New York City last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the unexpectedly strong economic performance in recent months.
"We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor," Powell said, adding that such growth could "put further progress on inflation at risk."
Recent economic growth, however, belies an alarm sounded by one of the most important economic indicators: the 10-year Treasury yield.
A rapid rise in U.S. government bond yields over recent weeks has elevated long-term borrowing costs for consumers seeking mortgage loans and corporations pursuing funds to expand their businesses.
The onset of some financial pain is exemplified by the housing market, where the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage briefly exceeded 8% on Monday, Mortgage News Daily data shows.
High mortgage rates have dramatically slowed the housing market, since homebuyers have balked at the stiff borrowing costs and home sellers have opted to stay put with mortgages that lock them into comparatively low rates.
Mortgage applications have fallen to their lowest level since 1996, the Mortgage Brokers Association said last month.
The Fed may consider the sharp increase in bond yields as indication that a string of previous rate hikes has begun to make its way through the economy, rendering an additional rate hike unnecessary, at least for now.
But the central bank hinted at its most recent meeting in September that it expects to raise rates one more time this year, according to projections included alongside a statement last month from the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates.
The benchmark interest rate currently stands at a range 5.25% to 5.5%, as a result of a near-historic series of rate increases.
The Fed plans to "proceed carefully" with its interest rate policy, Powell said last month, citing a "range of uncertainties."
Still, he added, the central bank will prioritize its goal of bringing inflation down to normal levels. "My colleagues and I remain resolute," he said.


U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, has sent a new letter to central bank Chair Jerome Powell complaining about what the Florida Republican sees as slow progress in shedding assets from its balance sheet.

Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, has sent a new letter to central bank Chair Jerome Powell complaining about what the Florida Republican sees as slow progress in shedding assets from its balance sheet.
Scott's letter to Powell, sent Monday, followed a barrage of letters he sent recently to the newest Fed board members - Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and governors Lisa Cook and Adriana Kugler - seeking their positions on the Fed's ongoing balance sheet reduction program.
To Powell, Scott asked why a process that has seen the Fed shed about a trillion dollars in bonds has moved more slowly than central bankers had expected.
“It is clear that your current plan to reduce the balance sheet is insufficient, and that it would never solve the problem of your massive balance sheet,” Scott wrote. “It makes no sense to me why you cannot reduce the balance sheet at the same rate you have increased it.”
Scott also asked if the Fed would move to a more “proactive” stance of balance sheet reduction.
The Fed is allowing nearly $100 billion in Treasury and mortgage bonds to mature each month without being replaced. It has not actively sold any securities, although some central bankers have weighed selling mortgage bonds at some point.
The Fed, which has long faced criticism that its asset purchases may warp financial markets, more than doubled the size of its balance sheet between the spring of 2020 and the summer of 2022, when holdings peaked just shy of $9 trillion.
In an interview, Scott said he had not received any response to his letters. A Fed spokesperson said the central bank plans a response.
Scott asked Powell for similar information in January. A spokesperson from Scott's office said Scott had not received a written response but had discussed balance sheet issues during in-person meetings with central bankers over the last several years.
Scott also pressed in his most recent letters to see whether the Fed officials support a bill he has co-sponsored with Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, to make the Fed's Inspector General a presidentially appointed post requiring Senate confirmation.
The IG is currently appointed by the Fed chair, an arrangement Scott, Warren and some outside experts have said presents a conflict of interest. The legislation, however, has made little apparent progress.
