The Federal Reserve meets this week for the first time since the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who has pledged a swift fiscal policy response by his administration to the pandemic crisis.
The Federal Reserve meets this week for the first time since the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who has pledged a swift fiscal policy response by his administration to the Covid-19 pandemic crisis.
“Biden, and Janet Yellen at the Treasury, are very eager to dispense stimulus,” said Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares. “In many ways, Yellen is an answer to Powell’s prayers.”
Although some metrics show improvement, the current economic picture is, at best, a mixed bag, with flagging job market gains, anemic retail sales and a pandemic that is still out of control in parts of the country.
“In the short term, we’re still facing a relatively difficult picture,” Giannotto said. “The implications for the future will be important for investors.”
At Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Wednesday news conference, investors will want reassurance that the central bank will continue to hold interest rates at near-zero levels for quite some time, and they expect Powell to reaffirm the Fed’s open-ended commitment to extremely accommodative policies.
“I think he might make comments to the extent that inflation has started to show some signs of budging, but nowhere to the levels that would alarm,” said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst for Commonwealth Financial Network.
Biden and Congressional Democrats have prioritized passage of additional fiscal stimulus on top of the $900 billion in aid to individuals, unemployed workers and businesses the lame-duck Congress passed just before the new year. Proponents say a robust response now is badly needed to mitigate further — and perhaps irreversible — damage to the nation’s commercial activity.
“Suddenly, the explosion for fiscal stimulus seems to ameliorate those concerns in the short term,” Giannotto said. “It went literally from one polar extreme to the other.”
If an epidemiological breakthrough changes the trajectory of the pandemic, a surge of stimulus on top of that could supercharge the economy to the extent that prices rise quickly.
The risk the Fed runs is that if an epidemiological breakthrough changes the trajectory of the pandemic, a surge of stimulus on top of that could supercharge the economy to the extent that prices rise quickly. This would pressure the Fed to revisit its stance on not raising interest rates sooner than it — and Wall Street — had planned, a recipe for market volatility.
Although skyrocketing inflation is possible — if unlikely — derailing a fragile economy with higher interest rates too soon is by far a greater threat to the recovery, Gaggar said. “The Fed would rather be late than early.”
Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management, said the Fed’s recent move to characterize its 2 percent inflation target as an average figure to be achieved over time gives officials more discretion when it comes to rate adjustments.
“I think that allows them a lot of flexibility, partly because we’ve been running below 2 percent for so long. At least for the time being, I think inflation isn't going to be the primary area of focus,” he said.
“To me, it’s a bit too early to start talking about it,” Heppenstall said, since the Covid-19 vaccine has yet to be widely available and distributed, and the emergence of new, more contagious strains of the coronavirus weigh on the nation’s reopening efforts. “I don't think, until the pandemic is more fully out of our lives, will we begin to talk about it.”
Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said Powell has to thread a needle in terms both of policy and how he communicates the Fed’s rationale behind those decisions. “We expect the Fed to continue to reiterate previous messages and signal to the market that the accommodative policy stance is in place for the foreseeable future,” he said.
Ripley said Powell is likely to stick to that narrative — going off-script can blindside Wall Street and throw cold water on investor confidence. In 2013, when then-Chair Ben Bernanke announced plans to taper the Fed’s quantitative easing program, markets were briefly thrown into disarray. “The last thing that Powell wants to see is a repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum when the economy is in recovery mode,” Ripley said.
“Maybe once vaccines get greater distribution, we’ll have a lot more flexibility there,” Giannotto said. “If they precipitate a loss of confidence, that’s far more difficult to try to repair.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to keep monetary policy locked in crisis-fighting mode on Wednesday as the U.S. central bank assesses an economy still struggling through the shock of a pandemic but looking forward to relief from a vaccination campaign and another government aid package.

The Fed, which will release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT), has used its recent meetings to roll out significant changes, linking any future increase in interest rates to a persistent rise in inflation, and tying any change in its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases to “substantial further progress” on its employment and inflation targets.
If anything, economic data since Fed officials met in the middle of December has been disappointing, and analysts say policymakers will likely fend off any suggestion that the economic boost from vaccines or a possible surge in inflation this spring will cause them to waver on the promise of continued loose monetary policy.
Major U.S. stock indexes were down about 1% in mid-morning trading, with analysts attributing the fall to concerns that vaccinations may not roll out as fast - or allow the economy to reopen as soon - as initially expected.
U.S. bond yields also dropped and a measure of longer-term market inflation expectations fell towards the Fed’s 2% target after a recent rise, evidence the recovery has not gained full traction and a pullback that, if sustained, would worry the central bank.
Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics, said she, like many economists, anticipates a “mini-boom” beginning in the spring as more of the U.S. population is vaccinated against the virus, people feel freer to travel and spend, and the Biden administration’s own spending plans move forward.
About 25 million people had received at least one of the required two doses of vaccine as of Sunday, and President Joe Biden hopes to boost the pace of daily shots to 1.5 million. He has requested an additional $1.9 trillion in government spending to speed up the vaccinations and expand benefits to U.S. businesses, workers and families hard hit by the pandemic.
Though that could fuel faster economic growth, Fed Chair Jerome “Powell will maintain his dovish tone for now,” by noting that inflation remains below the central bank’s 2% annual target and employment is still about 10 million short of its pre-pandemic level, Bostjancic wrote.
Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour after the release of the policy statement.
INFLATION TALK
Since approval of the first coronavirus vaccines in December, Fed officials have shared a general view that the U.S. economy was likely entering what one called the “endgame” of the pandemic, marked by short-term risks but likely buoyant growth in the second half of the year.
Fed policymakers, however, also have noted the large hole left in the economy, particularly the job market, after a year in which activity crashed spectacularly and then only partially rebounded. The United States actually lost jobs in December.
Many of the steps the Fed took last spring in response to the onset of recession, including slashing interest rates to zero, are now expected to remain in place for a potentially extended period of time - with policymakers not anticipating the need to raise rates for perhaps three years.
That’s designed to help push the economy onto a path of both higher employment and one that meets, after years of misses, the central bank’s 2% inflation goal.
Investors appear to have taken the Fed’s higher inflation talk seriously. The expected inflation rate over the longer term as measured by Treasury securities indexed for inflation has moved above 2%. Fed officials also have begun laying the foundation to ignore what’s expected to be a spike in prices this spring and summer, spurred by faster economic activity but also distorted by comparison to weak prices last year.
“The rebound in market-based inflation compensation measures will not alarm the Fed,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. “Instead, Fed officials are more likely to view the rise as a welcome vindication of the tweaks they made to the policy framework.”

With the virus spreading like “wildfire" in parts of the world, the first half of the year might be “lost," Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. “ Some are even concerned that vaccines may not prove useful enough to eradicate the virus. And these concerns will continue to linger over markets like a dark cloud until vaccine distributions get ironed out, and a definitive drop in contagion levels can thoroughly support the vaccine efficacy results."
The reality that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 billion stimulus package won’t be “rubber stamped” by the U.S. Senate is also weighing on sentiment, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
The fate of Biden's plan to send $1,400 to most Americans and deliver other support for the economy remains uncertain given the slim majority of the Democrats in the Senate. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are prepared to push ahead with the relief package, even if it means using procedural tools to pass the legislation without Republicans.

Stocks were broadly lower in early trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, as investors focus on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and the outlook for the economy as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.
The S&P 500 was down 1.5% in early trading, dragged lower by technology stocks like Amazon and Facebook as well as materials and energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.5% as well, while the Nasdaq composite was down 1.1%.
Investors are waiting to hear from the Federal Reserve at around 2 p.m. Eastern Time today. The Fed is expected to keep its extremely supportive policy stance unchanged given the slow progress in vanquishing the pandemic, analysts said.
Along with the Fed, this is the busiest week so far of quarterly earnings reporting season for U.S. companies. Apple and Facebook will report their quarterly results after Wednesday's closing bell.
More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to tell investors this week how they fared during the last three months of 2020. As a whole, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to say their fourth-quarter profit fell 5% from a year earlier. That’s a milder drop than the 9.4% they were forecasting earlier this month, according to FactSet.
Shares of GameStop soared 90% in early trading, as the video game retailer remains in a tug-of-war with Wall Street institutions and an activist community of mostly online investors. The online investors have bet that hedge funds have put too much money betting against the stock — a concept known as selling “short.” A pair of professional investment firms that placed big bets that GameStop’s stock would crash have largely abandoned their positions.
Markets have meandered since last week as investors weighed solid corporate earnings results against renewed worries that troubles with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the spread of new variants of coronavirus might delay a recovery from the pandemic.
With the virus spreading like “wildfire" in parts of the world, the first half of the year might be “lost," Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. “ Some are even concerned that vaccines may not prove useful enough to eradicate the virus. And these concerns will continue to linger over markets like a dark cloud until vaccine distributions get ironed out, and a definitive drop in contagion levels can thoroughly support the vaccine efficacy results."
The reality that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 billion stimulus package won’t be “rubber stamped” by the U.S. Senate is also weighing on sentiment, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
The fate of Biden's plan to send $1,400 to most Americans and deliver other support for the economy remains uncertain given the slim majority of the Democrats in the Senate. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are prepared to push ahead with the relief package, even if it means using procedural tools to pass the legislation without Republicans.

The Federal Reserve pledged on Wednesday to keep its low interest rate policies in place even well after the economy has sustained a recovery from the viral...
The Federal Reserve pledged on Wednesday to keep its low interest rate policies in place even well after the economy has sustained a recovery from the viral pandemic.
The Fed said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that the improvement in the economy and job market has slowed in recent months, particularly in industries affected by the raging pandemic. The officials kept their benchmark short-term rate pegged near zero and said they would keep buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to restrain longer-term borrowing rates and support the economy.
The policymakers also warned that the virus poses risks to the economy and removed phrases from their previous statement that had said the pandemic was weighing on the economy in the “near term” and that it posed risks “over the medium term." The removal of these phrases suggests that Fed officials aren't sure how long the uncertainty will last.
For now, the job market, in particular, is faltering, with nearly 10 million jobs still lost to the pandemic, which erupted 10 months ago. Hiring has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April. The job market has sputtered as the pandemic and colder weather have discouraged Americans from traveling, shopping, dining out or visiting entertainment venues. Retail sales have declined for three straight months.
At a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell was pressed on whether the Fed should respond to the recent speculative surge in the prices of some individual stocks, notably shares of GameStop, and whether that buying frenzy suggested a dangerous bubble in overall stock prices. Powell deflected the questions by saying the Fed's interest rate policies aren't well-suited to address speculation in the stock market.
In addition, he said, “if you look at what’s really been driving asset prices in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy. It’s expectations about vaccines and also fiscal policy. Those are the news items that have been driving asset values in recent months.”
In its statement Wednesday, the Fed added a reference to vaccinations — a sign that the policymakers, along with most economists, envision a sharp rebound in the second half of the year as the virus is brought under control by vaccines and government-enacted rescue money spreads through the economy. Americans fortunate enough to have kept their jobs have stockpiled massive savings that suggest pent-up demand that could be unleashed, with a big lift to the economy, once consumers increasingly feel safe about resuming their old spending patterns.
Asked about how the rollout of the vaccines might affect Fed policy, Powell said: “There’s nothing more important to the economy now than people getting vaccinated. If you think about the places where the economy is weak, as I mentioned bars and restaurants. That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last month, and that’s all because of the spread of the pandemic.”
He added: “We have not won this yet. We need to stay focused on it as a country and get there.”
The Fed has signaled that it expects to keep its key short-term rate at a record low between zero and 0.25% through at least 2023. Earlier this month, Vice Chair Richard Clarida said he expects the Fed's bond purchases to extend through the end of this year, which would mean continued downward pressure on long-term loan rates.
Since the Fed last met, in mid-December, there has been some good news. The distribution of an effective vaccine has begun, and a $900 billion relief package was enacted in late December. President Joe Biden has since proposed another financial support plan — a $1.9 trillion package that is larger than many economists had expected and will require congressional approval.
In recent months, Powell had repeatedly urged Congress and the White House to provide such stimulus. Some central bank officials have suggested that they might consider withdrawing Fed stimulus later this year, earlier than investors generally expect, although Powell contradicted that view in a public appearance earlier this month.
In December, the Fed said it would continue its bond purchases until “substantial further progress” had been reached toward achieving its goals of low unemployment and stable inflation of about 2% a year.
The Fed wants to avoid a repeat of 2013, when Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that the Fed was considering tapering the bond buys it was then engaged in. Bernanke’s remark caught markets unaware and sent longer-term rates jumping — an event that came to be dubbed the “taper tantrum.”
The Fed’s drive to keep long-term rates low have helped hold down mortgage rates and fueled home sales and price increases. In November, U.S. home prices jumped at their fastest pace in more than six years, surging 9% compared with 12 months earlier, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index.
The prospect of additional stimulus and ongoing vaccinations has raised some concern that as Americans eventually release pent-up demand for airline tickets, hotel rooms, new clothes and other goods and services, the economy might accelerate and annual inflation could surge above the Fed’s 2% target. If many companies don’t initially have the capacity to meet that demand, prices would pick up. Yet most Fed officials appear unconcerned about those trends potentially igniting runaway price increases.
One reason the Fed isn’t expected to raise rates anytime soon is that it adopted a framework last year that calls for inflation to average 2% over time. Given that inflation has mostly languished below that level since the Fed adopted it as a target in 2012, policymakers would have to let inflation run above 2% for some time to make up for the years of below-target price increases.

U.S. stock indexes opened lower on Wednesday as investors parsed through earnings reports from companies including Boeing and Microsoft, ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement later in the day.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes opened lower on Wednesday as investors parsed through earnings reports from companies including Boeing and Microsoft, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement later in the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.3 points, or 0.14%, at the open to 30893.78. The S&P 500 fell 12.8 points, or 0.33%, at the open to 3836.83, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 139.5 points, or 1.02%, to 13486.576 at the opening bell.

Stocks fell Wednesday even as more encouraging Covid-19 vaccination news hit the wires. Investors are also awaiting an update from the Federal Reserve on another big day for corporate earnings.
Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 361 points, or 1%. The S&P 500 was indicted to open 1.1% lower, while futures on the Nasdaq Composite were down 0.8%.
The move lower comes even as the Biden administration said it will purchase enough vaccines to inoculate most Americans by the end of the summer. For now, the administration will boost supply of vaccines to states by 16% for the next few weeks. This would catalyze reopenings and unleash pent-up demand partly spurred by fiscal stimulus.
While interest rates cannot go much lower from current levels, the Federal Reserve could indicate it may tighten policy—or act in different ways to raise interest rates—within the next year or so. Higher rates may be indicative of a strengthening economy, but they also pressure stock valuations and a move higher in rates before the economy is ready for it is detrimental to growth.
Tyler Richey of Sevens Report Research tells Barron’s that an ongoing short squeeze may also weigh on the broader market. In order to fund the ability to buy back stocks that were previously shorted, long-short hedge funds must sell existing holdings to raise cash. GameStop (ticker: GME), which had been heavily shorted, rose 45%, while AMC Entertainment (AMC) rose 220%. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) rose 5%.
Here were some other notable movers Wednesday:
Microsoft (MSFT) rose 1.5% after the company reported $2.03 in earnings per share, beating estimates of $1.64. The tech giant said revenue was $43 billion, against expectations of $40.1 billion.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 4% after beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company earned 52 cents per share, versus estimates of 47 cents. The chip maker brought in $3.2 billion in revenue, better than the forecast $3 billion.
Starbucks (SBUX) fell 3% after missing on the bottom line but beating on the top. The company earned 61 cents per share, better than the forecast 55 cents, but revenue was just $6.75 billion versus estimates of $6.93 billion.
Wendy’s (WEN) rose 1% after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $25 from $23.

U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Wednesday as investors parsed through earnings reports from companies including Boeing and Microsoft, ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement later in the day. Microsoft Corp gained 1.7% premarket, as the software maker continues to benefit from remote working and learning trends globally.
U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Wednesday as investors parsed through earnings reports from companies including Boeing and Microsoft, ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement later in the day.
Microsoft Corp gained 1.7% premarket, as the software maker continues to benefit from remote working and learning trends globally. Microsoft's results set a positive precedent for other technology-related companies including Apple Inc, Tesla Inc and Facebook Inc, which are set to report quarterly numbers later in the day.
Tech companies have recently come back into favor after blowout results from streaming service provider Netflix Inc , and as investors dumped economy-linked banks, energy and small-cap stocks. However, concerns about heightened stock market valuations, raging coronavirus cases and any potential disruption to vaccine rollouts have spooked investors about a pullback and increase in volatility in the near-term.
"The market is kind of in a wait-and-see mode. Investors just want to gather more information from the earnings season, they want more confidence from the Fed, and we should get a big insight into that today," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. The Fed is expected to keep monetary policy locked in crisis-fighting mode at its meeting ending on Wednesday, with investors also looking forward to relief from ongoing vaccinations and new government spending plans.
There is a high risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections derailing the world economy this year, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll, who forecast global GDP would reach pre-pandemic levels within two years. "We are going through what is likely to be the absolute worst moment of this entire pandemic right now," Erlam said.
Meanwhile, Boeing Co fell 3.3% after posting a record $12 billion annual loss, as it delayed its all-new 777X jet again and booked a $6.5 billion charge for the program. At 8:33 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 319 points, or 1.03%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 43 points, or 1.12%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 113.25 points, or 0.84%.
Starbucks Corp fell 2.7% after the coffee chain reported a larger-than-expected fall in quarterly sales, as the renewed surge in coronavirus cases in the United States kept customers at home. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc jumped 4.3% after the drugstore chain named the outgoing chief operating officer of Starbucks, Roz Brewer, as its chief executive officer.
Videogame retailer GameStop Corp's shares surged another 41.9% on Wednesday, as amateur investors continued to pile into the stock that has skyrocketed nearly 700% over the past two weeks.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and his predecessor Janet Yellen, now the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary, are both known for their dovish stances on inflation. That suggests they are unlikely to be in any particular hurry to push for higher interest rates.
New York (CNN Business) Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and his predecessor Janet Yellen, now the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary , are both known for their dovish stances on inflation. That suggests they are unlikely to be in any particular hurry to push for higher interest rates.
And with the economy still struggling due to Covid-19, neither Powell nor Yellen seems overly worried that the unprecedented amount of stimulus from both the central bank and Congress will spark any persistent inflationary pressures just yet.
But should they be?
Powell said in a Princeton talk last week that there could be "quite exuberant spending" from consumers over the next few months thanks to stimulus checks and an improving economy following broader access to vaccines. Some prices could rise as a result.
But the Fed chair argued this may not necessarily be inflationary for the long haul. Price increases could be -- to use a favorite Fed buzzword -- transitory.
Yellen similarly noted in her Senate confirmation hearing last week that she believes the Fed and the Biden administration should take advantage of interest rates being near zero and thus spend more on stimulus.
In other words, now is not the time to fret over inflation.
"Inflation is always a concern and it's an easy concept to grasp," said Mimi Song, chief economist at CrossBorder Solutions. "Lower supplies could lead to higher prices for the short-term and more stimulus could lead to higher disposable income."
But Song contends the global pandemic and recession will likely keep a lid on prices. The priority needs to be the economic recovery, not the fear of inflation several years from now.
Inflation could come roaring back
Still, some worry that Powell and Yellen are being too dismissive. The economy may not be able to remain in a scenario where inflation pressure simmers without boiling over.
The 10-year Treasury yield is now back above 1% -- its highest level since March. Oil prices are up 10% in the past month as well. These are signs that investors are betting on more inflation sooner rather than later.
"There is this tug of war around inflation," said Todd Lowenstein, equity strategy executive of The Private Bank at Union Bank. "Inflation could be transitory but we need to keep an eye on the bond market due to massive federal spending."
Lowenstein said stimulus spending, while necessary, could lead to further declines in the value of the dollar, which would fan the flames of inflation. But the Fed is not in a position to raise rates to stem inflation while the economy is still so fragile. Inflation could become more of a consistent problem.
"Could inflation become entrenched? The Fed doesn't want to fight it right now, but historically the issue is that inflation is like toothpaste in a tube. It's impossible to put back," Lowenstein said.
If inflation pressure does mount, the Fed can't ignore it indefinitely -- at some point, it has to fight it off.
And that is key. The Fed has tried to remain out of politics and do what it deems best for the economy, no matter what actions the president and Congress decide to take.
"The Fed risks losing the perception of its independence if it doesn't fight inflation," said Adam Lampe, the CEO and Co-founder of Mint Wealth Management.
"An unexpected rise in inflation could be a risk," he added. "Inflation should be modest in 2021, but once it's let out of the bag it could come back quickly."
Keep an eye on wages and the job market
So the Fed may be forced to raise rates sooner than the market is currently expecting, or it may need to more rapidly cut back on -- or taper -- its current program of bond purchases. The last time the Fed made a significant change to its asset purchases, in June 2013, stocks sold off rapidly in what came to be known as the " taper tantrum ."
Still, the biggest driver of inflation tends to be a healthy job market and bigger paychecks for workers. That's not the case right now.
According to the December jobs report , average hourly wages grew about 5% from a year ago. But the government noted those increases "largely reflect the disproportionate number of lower-paid workers in leisure and hospitality who went off payrolls."
In other words, wage growth would have been a lot lower if more Americans were actually working.

Other government data shows that there are only small pockets of inflation.
According to the latest consumer price index report, food prices rose 3.9%. Appliance prices shot up 6.2% and used car prices surged 10%. But overall, consumer prices gained just 1.4% over the past year.
"If you look at the stock market and industries like housing, you might feel like the economy is back on its feet. But there is still enough slack in the job market to prevent any short-term inflation," said Craig Fehr, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "I don't think inflation will be a predominant risk."
Yet Fehr is concerned that inflation inevitably will become a major issue that policymakers must tackle.
"Longer-term, the risks of inflation cannot be overstated. The market is expecting incredible levels of Fed stimulus for an extended period of time," he said. "If you ask me what usually keeps me up at night, it's inflation."

Stock markets are down Wednesday as investors focus on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and the outlook for the economy as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.
European indexes lost early gains after a mixed session in Asia. In the U.S., futures are down 0.8% for both the Dow and the S&P 500.
The Fed is expected to keep its extremely supportive policy stance unchanged given the slow progress in vanquishing the pandemic, analysts said.
Markets have meandered since last week as investors weighed solid corporate earnings results against renewed worries that troubles with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the spread of new variants of coronavirus might delay a recovery from the pandemic.
With the virus spreading like “wildfire" in parts of the world, the first half of the year might be “lost," Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. “ Some are even concerned that vaccines may not prove useful enough to eradicate the virus. And these concerns will continue to linger over markets like a dark cloud until vaccine distributions get ironed out, and a definitive drop in contagion levels can thoroughly support the vaccine efficacy results."
The reality that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 billion stimulus package won’t be “rubber stamped” by the U.S. Senate is also weighing on sentiment, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index added 0.3% to 28,635.21, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.3% to 29,297.53. The Kospi in South Korea sank 0.6% to 3,122.56, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,573.34. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 6,780.60.
Germany's DAX fell 1.7% to 13,635, France's CAC 40 dropped 1.3% to 5,454. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.9% to 6,594.
This is the busiest week so far of quarterly earnings reporting season for U.S. companies.
More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to tell investors this week how they fared during the last three months of 2020. As a whole, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to say their fourth-quarter profit fell 5% from a year earlier. That’s a milder drop than the 9.4% they were forecasting earlier this month, according to FactSet.
The fate of Biden's plan to send $1,400 to most Americans and deliver other support for the economy remains uncertain given the slim majority of the Democrats in the Senate. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are prepared to push ahead with the relief package, even if it means using procedural tools to pass the legislation without Republicans.
In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil dropped 1 cent to $52.60 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 16 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 9 cents to $55.73 per barrel.
The dollar was trading at 103.83 Japanese yen, up from 103.62 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.2115 from $1.2163.

Stock markets are down Wednesday as investors focus on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting and the outlook for the economy as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.
European indexes lost early gains after a mixed session in Asia. In the U.S., futures are down 0.8% for both the Dow and the S&P 500.
The Fed is expected to keep its extremely supportive policy stance unchanged given the slow progress in vanquishing the pandemic, analysts said.
Markets have meandered since last week as investors weighed solid corporate earnings results against renewed worries that troubles with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the spread of new variants of coronavirus might delay a recovery from the pandemic.
With the virus spreading like “wildfire" in parts of the world, the first half of the year might be “lost," Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. “ Some are even concerned that vaccines may not prove useful enough to eradicate the virus. And these concerns will continue to linger over markets like a dark cloud until vaccine distributions get ironed out, and a definitive drop in contagion levels can thoroughly support the vaccine efficacy results."
The reality that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 billion stimulus package won’t be “rubber stamped” by the U.S. Senate is also weighing on sentiment, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index added 0.3% to 28,635.21, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.3% to 29,297.53. The Kospi in South Korea sank 0.6% to 3,122.56, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,573.34. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 6,780.60.
Germany's DAX fell 1.7% to 13,635, France's CAC 40 dropped 1.3% to 5,454. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.9% to 6,594.
This is the busiest week so far of quarterly earnings reporting season for U.S. companies.
More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to tell investors this week how they fared during the last three months of 2020. As a whole, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to say their fourth-quarter profit fell 5% from a year earlier. That’s a milder drop than the 9.4% they were forecasting earlier this month, according to FactSet.
The fate of Biden's plan to send $1,400 to most Americans and deliver other support for the economy remains uncertain given the slim majority of the Democrats in the Senate. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are prepared to push ahead with the relief package, even if it means using procedural tools to pass the legislation without Republicans.
In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil dropped 1 cent to $52.60 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 16 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 9 cents to $55.73 per barrel.
The dollar was trading at 103.83 Japanese yen, up from 103.62 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.2115 from $1.2163.

Fund managers will be keen for reassurance on central bank’s bond-buying programme
European equities drifted and US Treasury bonds traded steadily on Wednesday morning, as investors held back from making large bets before the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s latest monthly meeting.
The Stoxx 600 benchmark index was flat in early trading, while Germany’s Xetra Dax dipped 0.4 per cent and the UK’s FTSE 100 was also unmoved.
The yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond, which crossed 1 per cent for the first time since March 2020 as investors bet US President Joe Biden’s stimulus plan would fuel inflation, hovered at around 1.04 per cent. The dollar, as measured against a basket of currencies, crept 0.1 per cent higher.
Conclusion
The moves came ahead of the conclusion of the Fed’s first meeting of 2021. When its chair Jay Powell addresses the media later, investors will be keen for reassurance that the central bank has no immediate plans to taper its $120 billion-plus (€99 billion) of monthly debt purchases that have supported markets through the pandemic.
Any tightening of its monetary policy stance could encourage this year’s Treasuries sell-off, and ripple across asset markets, by changing the risk-free rate that underpins equity and other valuations.
Analysts and investors widely expect Mr Powell to signal there will be no changes to the central bank’s policy for at least the rest of this year, however, as rising coronavirus cases continue to inflict damage on the US economy.
“There is not much left for the Fed to do,” said Luis Costa, strategist at Citi, “away from a simple reassurance that an ultra-dovish monetary policy stance will probably stay in vogue for the next many quarters.”
Investors have shifted their focus towards fiscal policy and the strength of the economic recovery in recent weeks. Mr Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan has run into opposition from Republican lawmakers, while US new unemployment claims are running at more than 900,000 a week and retail sales have declined for three consecutive months.
Rebound
“An economic rebound in the US would be very dependent on stimulus but also [Covid-19] vaccines being rolled out quickly and successfully,” said Nic Hoogewijs, a bond fund manager at Lombard Odier.
“Any bump in the road would be a buying signal for safe haven instruments” such as government bonds, he added. The yield on the 10-year bond, which moves inversely to the price of the security “shouldn’t go much beyond 1.4 per cent this year”, he said.
Any big shift in monetary policy could change the picture. But the Fed’s vice-chair Richard Clarida commented earlier this month that the central bank was unlikely to move on interest rates until inflation stayed at 2 per cent “for a year”, while Mr Powell has also rebutted speculation of an early exit from the asset purchase programme.

The euro fell on Wednesday, under pressure after a European Central Bank official said the bank was monitoring the currency closely, while the dollar perked up ahead of the Federal Reserve's first meeting of the year.

LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday, under pressure after a European Central Bank official said the bank was monitoring the currency closely, while the dollar perked up ahead of the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year.
ECB governing council member Klaas Knot said the central bank has room to cut its deposit rate further, should it be necessary to improve financing conditions and reach its inflation target.
Knot’s comment constituted the most explicit hint to date from an ECB policymaker about the possibility of a rate cut to stem a rally in the euro - a move that seemed highly unlikely until recently.
The single currency is up almost 15% since March last year, against a dollar that most analysts expect to decline further. Knot’s comments came as the euro, already weaker on the day, extended losses against the greenback.
It last traded 0.3% lower at $1.2120.
Analysts said reports on Tuesday that the ECB was studying whether differences with the Fed’s policy in the United States were boosting the euro - part of a wider review of financing conditions - would not have a material effect on the currency.
It’s “probably one of those headlines where it’s a buy on the dip moment in euro/dollar here,” said Jordan Rochester, FX strategist at Nomura in a note to clients. He remains long on the pair with a target of $1.25 by the end of March.
Alexandre Dolci, G10 FX strategist at BBVA, has a similar outlook.
“Despite the heavy positioning, we continue to favour buying euro/dollar on dips as we see the pair steadying in a $1.20-$1.25 range,” he said.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has repeatedly said the central bank is carefully monitoring the single currency’s exchange rate.
“We suspect they might find that higher inflation is more credible in the US and that euro/dollar spot is closer related to the global manufacturing sector (which is doing well), not European services and maybe, that expectations are elevated in terms of Europe’s comeback,” said Lars Sparresø Merklin, senior analyst at Danske Bank. “Either way, this adds to a growing number of countries who appear uncomfortable with USD weakness.”
The dollar reversed early declines in Asia to trade up 0.3% at 90.393 as markets waited for comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is likely to renew a commitment to ultra-easy policy.
Powell is due to speak at a news conference after the central bank’s two-day policy meeting, which ends Wednesday.
Earlier this month, he said in a web symposium with Princeton University that the U.S. economy is still far from the Fed’s inflation and employment goals, and it is too early to discuss altering monthly bond purchases.
“While the Fed had been consistent for the past few months that the balance of risks was still to the downside, we could see a more neutral stance being taken,” said John Velis, FX and macro strategist at BNY Mellon.
“This would be seen as a marginally hawkish turn on the Committee, but we think that the Chair will make it quite clear that neither interest rate rises nor any quantified timeline for tapering bond purchases is under consideration.”
Elsewhere, the British pound climbed to its highest since May 1, 2018 at $1.3753 before trading flat at $1.3730.
The Aussie dollar slipped 0.4% to 77.18 U.S. cents, paring Tuesday’s 0.5% rally.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.2% at 1104 GMT, having fallen around 1% since it hit a new all-time high on Jan. 21.
Following a weak Asian session in which shares were hurt by profit-taking, European indexes also retreated, with the STOXX 600 down 0.8%.
London’s FTSE 100 was down 0.7% while Germany’s DAX was down 1%.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies and was last at 90.359, up 0.2% on the day.
“There’s been a bit of a shift of tone in markets in the last few days,” said Catherine Doyle, investment specialist at Newton Investment Management.
“Markets are starting to worry about COVID again,” she added, highlighting in particular the Brazilian and South African variants of the virus.
“We’re now going into a seasonally more difficult period, as you come into February that’s typically when you might see markets pause if they started off the year very strongly,” Doyle said.
“Within our portfolio we’ve put on some protection to potentially cushion us in case there is some volatility.”
Quarterly earnings from U.S. tech giants including Facebook and Apple, are due later in the session.
“With some financial assets currently trading at what many are describing as bubble territory, there’ll be heightened attention on these releases to see whether these current valuations are justified,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note to clients.
S&P 500 e-minis were down around 0.4%, but Nasdaq futures were up 0.2%, helped by strong Microsoft earnings the previous session.
Microsoft said its Azure cloud computing services grew by 50%.
Heightened participation of retail investors in the stock market has come into focus this week, as amateur traders on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets stock trading discussion group piled into GameStop, causing it to skyrocket while professional shortsellers scrambled to cover losing bets.
To some stock market professionals, the recent moves look symbolic of a stock market that may be overvalued at the end of a year dominated by floods of fiscal and monetary stimulus to ease the coronavirus crisis.
Newton Investment Management’s Doyle said that people “taking a punt on the market” is a sign that “risk appetite has got carried away”.
Also in focus is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting. The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes but investors will be listening for shifts in tone around the economic outlook and any mention of slowing down - or “tapering” - the Fed’s asset purchases.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield held close to the three-week low it hit in the previous session, and was broadly flat on the day at 1.0432%.
The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2021, and said the coronavirus-triggered downturn last year would be nearly one percentage point less severe than expected.
Global COVID-19 cases surpassed 100 million on Wednesday and countries around the world are struggling with new variants of the virus and delays in vaccine rollouts.
The euro was down 0.3% at $1.21245, while euro zone government bond yields edged up slightly.
Gold was down 0.4%. Bitcoin was down around 3%.
Oil prices rose after industry data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week and China recorded its lowest daily rise in COVID-19 cases in more than two weeks.

Mass government bond buying programmes by the European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve and other top central banks will protect the credit ratings of most developed economies this year but poorer nations will not be so fortunate, S&P Global says.
LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Mass government bond buying programmes by the European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve and other top central banks will protect the credit ratings of most developed economies this year but poorer nations will not be so fortunate, S&P Global says.
The coronavirus crisis is expected to push the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios in the G7 group of rich nations up by 23 percentage points by the end of 2021 compared to 2019, without yet triggering a cut in their credit ratings, a measure of a country’s fiscal health.
But among less developed nations, ratings have been cut over the past year for eight African countries, five Middle East states and 11 South American, central American and Caribbean countries, and more downgrades are on the way, S&P Global says.
At present, 16 emerging market (EM) countries still have negative outlooks on their S&P ratings, signalling they could face a downgrade, while fast-rising debt levels in Brazil and South Africa are not expected to stabilise even by 2023.
Speaking before the release of a 2021 sovereign outlook, one of S&P’s top sovereign analysts, Frank Gill, told Reuters he expected 2021 would “see a lot more rating actions in EM”.
“That doesn’t mean that developed economies are getting a pass. It just means that they have bought themselves more time,” he said.
In the euro zone, the ECB’s bond buying programme has been hoovering up the equivalent of all the extra debt issued by the bloc’s 27 members to combat the coronavirus crisis.
Assessing the situation in richer nations, Gill said: “Are we going to rush to any conclusions about the permanent damage to structural growth? Highly unlikely.”
“So I don’t think you’re going to see a lot of rating actions in the OECD in 2021,” he said.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development groups 37 countries, stretching from the United States to European nations to Japan and Australia.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve is expected to keep U.S. monetary policy locked in crisis-fighting mode at its meeting ending on Wednesday as policymakers assess an economy still struggling through the shock of a pandemic but looking forward to relief from ongoing vaccinations and new government spending plans.
Over its last few meetings the Fed has rolled out significant changes to U.S. policy, linking any future increase in interest rates to a persistent rise in inflation, and tying any change in its US$120 billion in monthly bond purchases to "substantial further progress" on its employment and inflation targets.

If anything, economic data since the Fed met in December has disappointed, and analysts say central bank policymakers will likely fend off any suggestion that the economic boost from vaccines or a possible surge in prices this spring will cause them to waver on the promise of continued loose monetary policy.
Graphic: Inflation outlook improves - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/bdwvkyloovm/chart.png
Like many economists, Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Financial Economist Kathy Bostjancic said she anticipates a "mini-boom" beginning in the spring as more of the population is vaccinated, people feel freer to travel and spend, and the Biden administration's own spending plans moved forward.
About 25 million people had received at least one of the required two vaccine doses as of Sunday, and Biden hopes to boost the pace of daily shots to 1.5 million. He has requested an additional US$1.9 trillion in government spending to speed vaccinations and expand benefits available for households and businesses.

Though that could fuel faster economic growth, "Powell will maintain his dovish tone for now," by noting that inflation remains below the Fed's 2per cent annual target and the level of jobs is still about 10 million short of its pre-pandemic level, Bostjancic wrote.
Since approval of the first coronavirus vaccines in December, Fed officials have shared a general view that the U.S. economy was likely entering what one called the "endgame" of the pandemic, with short-term risks but a likely buoyant second half of this year.
However they've also noted the large hole left in the economy, particularly the job market, after a year that saw activity crash spectacularly last spring and come back only partially so far due to the ongoing health crisis. The United States actually lost jobs in December.
Many of the steps that the Fed took last spring in response to the onset of recession, including slashing interest rates to zero, are now expected to remain in place for a potentially extended period of time - with policymakers not anticipating the need to raise interest rates for perhaps three years.

That's designed to help push the economy onto a path of both higher employment and one that meets, after years of misses, the Fed's 2per cent inflation goal.
Investors appear to have taken the Fed's higher inflation talk seriously. The expected inflation rate over the longer term as measured by Treasury securities indexed for inflation has moved above 2per cent. Fed officials themselves have begun laying the foundation to ignore what's expected to be a spike in prices this spring and summer, spurred by faster economic activity but also distorted by comparison to weak prices last year.
"The rebound in market-based inflation compensation measures will not alarm the Fed," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "Instead, Fed officials are more likely to view the rise as a welcome vindication of the tweaks they made to the policy framework."

However they’ve also noted the large hole left in the economy, particularly the job market, after a year that saw activity crash spectacularly last spring and come back only partially so far due to the ongoing health crisis. The United States actually lost jobs in December.
Many of the steps that the Fed took last spring in response to the onset of recession, including slashing interest rates to zero, are now expected to remain in place for a potentially extended period of time - with policymakers not anticipating the need to raise interest rates for perhaps three years.
That’s designed to help push the economy onto a path of both higher employment and one that meets, after years of misses, the Fed’s 2% inflation goal.
Investors appear to have taken the Fed’s higher inflation talk seriously. The expected inflation rate over the longer term as measured by Treasury securities indexed for inflation has moved above 2%. Fed officials themselves have begun laying the foundation to ignore what’s expected to be a spike in prices this spring and summer, spurred by faster economic activity but also distorted by comparison to weak prices last year.
“The rebound in market-based inflation compensation measures will not alarm the Fed,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. “Instead, Fed officials are more likely to view the rise as a welcome vindication of the tweaks they made to the policy framework.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to keep U.S. monetary policy locked in crisis-fighting mode at its meeting ending on Wednesday as policymakers assess an economy still struggling through the shock of a pandemic but looking forward to relief from ongoing vaccinations and new government spending plans.

Over its last few meetings the Fed has rolled out significant changes to U.S. policy, linking any future increase in interest rates to a persistent rise in inflation, and tying any change in its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases to “substantial further progress” on its employment and inflation targets.
If anything, economic data since the Fed met in December has disappointed, and analysts say central bank policymakers will likely fend off any suggestion that the economic boost from vaccines or a possible surge in prices this spring will cause them to waver on the promise of continued loose monetary policy.
Graphic: Inflation outlook improves -
Like many economists, Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Financial Economist Kathy Bostjancic said she anticipates a “mini-boom” beginning in the spring as more of the population is vaccinated, people feel freer to travel and spend, and the Biden administration’s own spending plans moved forward.
About 25 million people had received at least one of the required two vaccine doses as of Sunday, and Biden hopes to boost the pace of daily shots to 1.5 million. He has requested an additional $1.9 trillion in government spending to speed vaccinations and expand benefits available for households and businesses.
Though that could fuel faster economic growth, “Powell will maintain his dovish tone for now,” by noting that inflation remains below the Fed’s 2% annual target and the level of jobs is still about 10 million short of its pre-pandemic level, Bostjancic wrote.

The Fed is expected to keep its extremely supportive policy stance unchanged given the slow progress in vanquishing the pandemic, analysts said.
Markets have meandered since last week as investors weighed solid corporate earnings results against renewed worries that troubles with COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the spread of new variants of coronavirus might delay a recovery from the pandemic.
With the virus spreading like “wildfire" in parts of the world, the first half of the year might be “lost," Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary. “ Some are even concerned that vaccines may not prove useful enough to eradicate the virus. And these concerns will continue to linger over markets like a dark cloud until vaccine distributions get ironed out, and a definitive drop in contagion levels can thoroughly support the vaccine efficacy results."
The reality that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 billion stimulus package won’t be “rubber stamped” by the U.S. Senate is also weighing on sentiment, Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report.
For now, “ranging is a summation of the state of play in the financial markets at the moment," he said.
Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index added 0.3% to 28,635.21, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.3% to 29,297.53. The Kospi in South Korea sank 0.6% to 3,122.56, while the Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher to 3,573.34. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 6,780.60.
Overnight, the S&P 500 lost 0.1% to 3,849.62 but was within 0.2% of the record high it set Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1%, to 30,937.04. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite also slid 0.1%, to 13,626.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 0.6%, to 2,149.86.
This is the busiest week so far of quarterly earnings reporting season for U.S. companies.
More than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to tell investors this week how they fared during the last three months of 2020. As a whole, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to say their fourth-quarter profit fell 5% from a year earlier. That’s a milder drop than the 9.4% they were forecasting earlier this month, according to FactSet.
The fate of Biden's plan to send $1,400 to most Americans and deliver other support for the economy remains uncertain given the slim majority of the Democrats in the Senate. But on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats are prepared to push ahead with the relief package, even if it means using procedural tools to pass the legislation without Republicans.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged lower to 1.03% from 1.04% late Tuesday.
In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 29 cents to $52.90 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 16 cents to $52.61 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 32 cents to $55.96 per barrel.
The U.S. dollar was trading at 103.79 Japanese yen, up from 103.62 yen late Tuesday. The euro slipped to $1.2122 from $1.2163.

The dollar reversed declines against riskier currencies, even as pandemic recovery hopes got a boost from the International Monetary Fund’s upgrading its forecast for 2021 global growth.
Treasury yields, whose rise had supported the dollar at the start of this year, declined overnight amid caution about the eventual size of and delays to President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan.
“While the Fed had been consistent for the past few months that the balance of risks was still to the downside, we could see a more neutral stance being taken,” said John Velis, FX and macro strategist at BNY Mellon.
“This would be seen as a marginally hawkish turn on the Committee, but we think that the Chair will make it quite clear that neither interest rate rises nor any quantified timeline for tapering bond purchases is under consideration.”
The Fed chair is due to speak at a news conference after the central bank’s two-day policy meeting, which ends Wednesday.
Earlier this month, he said in a web symposium with Princeton University that the U.S. economy is still far from the Fed’s inflation and employment goals, and it is too early to discuss altering monthly bond purchases.

U.S. government bond yields were steady early in the trading session, with Powell expected to give an update on the central bank's economic outlook and monetary policy amid the pandemic.
Many investors hope Powell and his colleagues will steer clear of the word "tapering," the process by which the central bank would curb its monthly bond purchases that have helped keep the financial system adrift with cash and encouraged investors to take on risk despite rich equity valuations.
The Fed is due to release its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, with Powell expected to speak to reporters at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will now analyze the risk climate change poses to the financial system.
On Jan. 25, the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank simultaneously signaled their intent to make climate considerations a central part of finance. Both say they will now analyze the risk climate poses to the stability of individual banks, as well as the broader financial system.
The announcements are being welcomed by environmental groups as a way to “ensure that every financial decision takes climate change into account,” Giulia Christianson, who leads sustainable Investing efforts at the World Resources Institute, wrote by email.
The Federal Reserve will create a group of senior staff across the Fed system to “understand the potential implications of climate change for financial institutions, infrastructure, and markets.” The unit is being led by Kevin Stiroh, a respected Treasury official who previously headed up the Fed’s supervision unit as well as research into climate-related risks. Stiroh will now be charged with helping turn the Fed’s escalating concern about the climate into practical guidance and policies that could reshape everything from the assets banks keep on their books to risks companies must disclose.
“This is no longer a shouting match between divestment campaigners and banks that don’t want to do anything,” says Ilmi Granoff, director of sustainable finance at the ClimateWorks Foundation. “It’s now the federal regulator conducting serious oversight of a serious set of risks.”
Europe’s central bank went even further, launching a “climate change centre” with a 10-person team reporting to bank president Christine Lagarde. The new division will likely have influence over the bloc’s monetary policy, bank oversight, and rules governing billions of euros in new green financing (where it has more of a mandate than the US Fed). The EU has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050—the largest economy after China (2060) to do so—and European Central Bank officials are pushing hard to ensure markets begin pricing climate risk into their financial decisions.
All together now
Together, the moves by the ECB and Fed signal they are serious about integrating climate risk into their core mission of supervising banks and stabilizing the financial system. While neither body is charged with decarbonizing the economy, their mission to ensure banks’ solvency and avoid systematic risk that threatens the financial system (such as the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008), is precisely what is elevating climate as a critical concern.
One 2020 study commissioned by an UN-affiliated investor group—the Inevitable Policy Response (IPR) report—concluded that massive, disruptive economic dislocation due to climate change is now inevitable. Trillions of dollars will likely be reallocated among winners and losers in the low-carbon economy. High-emitting companies in the utility sector, for example, stand to lose more than 30% of their value, and the fossil fuel sector is already facing much worse.
“Pressure for policy action will continue to increase and come from all angles” between 2023 and 2025 the IPR’s authors state, as countries ratchet up their commitment under the Paris Agreement.
In the US, which has resisted Europe’s early embrace of climate policy, big changes are poised to reshape Wall Street: climate disclosure requirements, new risk metrics tied to emissions, and accounting guidance for potential stranded assets such as fossil fuels. All of this is likely to be coordinated among major economies, says Brian O’Hanlon, who works on the global climate finance team at the Rocky Mountain Institute. “In the US, you’re going to see the financial system as a whole moving in a singular direction,” he says.
The shift will take time to formalize, and regulation is likely to be the lagging, not leading, indicator. But the private sector is already moving. In his most letter to CEOs, BlackRock chief Larry Fink told executives that “climate risk is investment risk.” Banks or asset managers now on the fence are more likely to dump stranded assets such as thermal coal, and turn an increasingly skeptical eye on investments set to decline in value during the energy transition. Disclosing these risks will become harder to avoid as regulators overseeing more than 30% (pdf) of the world’s GDP signal they will put climate risks in the same category as any other, from cybersecurity to liquidity risks.
Peer pressure may be even more intense. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock is now lobbying to adopt a global standard on climate risk reporting. It’s urging companies to adopt voluntary standards, “rather than waiting for regulators to impose them.”

Most emerging market stocks and currencies fell slightly on Wednesday as investors awaited more cues on U.S. monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, while Russian stocks rose after Moscow lifted some COVID-19 curbs. Turkey's lira and South Africa's rand dropped about 0.3% and 0.2% respectively to the dollar, with investors expecting the U.S. central bank to hold interest rates and reaffirm its dovish outlook.
Most other currencies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa kept to tight ranges, as investors were uncertain over the Fed's stance in the face of more fiscal spending in the United States. The dollar was on the back foot ahead of the Fed's announcement, while U.S. yields also retreated.
"A Fed ready to do whatever it takes to support the world's largest economy, regardless what the government's actions may be, is likely to prove negative for the USD ... a dovish message could reignite the risk-on trade," Charalambos Pissouros, senior market analyst at JFD Group, wrote in a note. The prospect of easy monetary policy has greatly benefited emerging market stocks, which have outperformed their developed world peers since late-last year.
The MSCI's index of emerging market stocks fell 0.5% on Wednesday, having recently hit a record high. Russia's rouble was flat to the dollar after modest gains on Tuesday. Russian stocks rose 0.2% after Moscow relaxed an overnight curfew and restrictions on the number of employees working from offices.
Investors are also anticipating Russian unemployment and December GDP data this week. Rising coronavirus cases and a slower-than-expected vaccine rollout have hurt emerging market currencies in recent sessions, offsetting optimism over an eventual economic recovery this year.
In central Europe, Hungary's forint lagged its peers against the euro after the country's central bank left interest rates unchanged. Most central European stocks rose slightly.

WASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve pledged on Wednesday to keep its low interest rate policies in place even well after the economy has sustained a recovery from the viral pandemic.
The Fed said in a statement after its latest policy meeting that the improvement in the economy and job market has slowed in recent months, particularly in industries affected by the raging pandemic. The officials kept their benchmark short-term rate pegged near zero and said they would keep buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to restrain longer-term borrowing rates and support the economy.
The policymakers also warned that the virus poses risks to the economy and removed a phrase from their previous statement that had said the risks were “over the medium term.“ The removal of this phrase suggested that Fed officials are unsure how long the uncertainty will last.
For now, the job market, in particular, is faltering, with nearly 10 million jobs still lost to the pandemic, which erupted 10 months ago. Hiring has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April. The job market has sputtered as the pandemic and colder weather have discouraged Americans from travelling, shopping, dining out or visiting entertainment venues. Retail sales have declined for three straight months.
Along with the Fed, most economists expect a sharp rebound in the second half of the year as the coronavirus is brought under control and government-enacted rescue money spreads through the economy. As a whole, Americans fortunate enough to have kept their jobs have stockpiled massive savings that suggest pent-up demand that could be unleashed, with a big lift to the economy, once consumers increasingly feel safe about resuming their old spending patterns.
At the same time, the Fed has signalled that it expects to keep its key short-term rate at a record low between zero and 0.25% through at least 2023. Earlier this month, Vice Chair Richard Clarida said he expects the Fed’s bond purchases to extend through the end of this year, which would mean continued downward pressure on long-term loan rates.
Since the Fed last met, in mid-December, there has been some good news. The distribution of an effective vaccine has begun, and a $900 billion relief package was enacted in late December. President Joe Biden has since proposed another financial support plan — a $1.9 trillion package that is larger than many economists had expected and will require congressional approval.
In recent months, Powell had repeatedly urged Congress and the White House to provide such stimulus. Some central bank officials have suggested that they might consider withdrawing Fed stimulus later this year, earlier than investors generally expect, although Powell contradicted that view in a public appearance earlier this month.
The Fed wants to avoid a repeat of 2013, when Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that the Fed was considering tapering the bond buys it was then engaged in. Bernanke’s remark caught markets unaware and sent longer-term rates jumping — an event that came to be dubbed the “taper tantrum.”
The Fed has pinned its benchmark short-term rate near zero, and it signalled in December that the rate would likely remain there through at least 2023. It is also buying $80 billion in Treasury bonds and $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month to help keep longer-term borrowing rates low. In December, the Fed said it would continue those purchases until “substantial further progress” had been reached toward achieving its goals of low unemployment and stable inflation of about 2% a year.
The Fed’s drive to keep long-term rates low have helped hold down mortgage rates and fueled home sales and price increases. In November, U.S. home prices jumped at their fastest pace in more than six years, surging 9% compared with 12 months earlier, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index.
The prospect of additional stimulus and ongoing vaccinations has raised some concern that as Americans eventually release pent-up demand for airline tickets, hotel rooms, new clothes and other goods and services, the economy might accelerate and annual inflation could surge above the Fed’s 2% target. If many companies don’t initially have the capacity to meet that demand, prices would pick up. Yet most Fed officials appear unconcerned about those trends potentially igniting runaway price increases.
One reason the Fed isn’t expected to raise rates anytime soon is that it adopted a framework last year that calls for inflation to average 2% over time. Given that inflation has mostly languished below that level since the Fed adopted it as a target in 2012, policymakers would have to let inflation run above 2% for some time to make up for the years of below-target price increases.

The Fed refers to this framework as “flexible.” It isn’t committing to a time period over which inflation will exceed 2%. The central bank prefers some inflation in order to guard against deflation, a destabilizing fall in wages and prices.
As a result, even if hiring picks up and unemployment tumbles later this year as the vaccines curb the virus, economists expect the Fed to stress that it won’t raise rates until inflation actually accelerates.
