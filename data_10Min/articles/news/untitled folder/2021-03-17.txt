The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%, trading below a one-year peak, with the utilities and basic resources sectors leading declines.
The Fed’s policy stance will be watched after a recent run-up in Treasury yields stoked investor concerns about inflation picking up as the U.S. economy rebounds from the pandemic. The central bank’s policy statement and economic forecasts are due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
“Investors prefer to stand on the sidelines ahead of one of the most anticipated FOMC meetings in the past few quarters,” said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at Axi.
“Fed Chair Powell will have a difficult time convincing markets that a rising inflation rate is not cause for concern, and that a rate hike is still at least two years away.”

The benchmark 10-year yield ticked up to a new 13-month high of 1.676%, denting demand for some high-growth technology stocks and pressuring the Nasdaq by about 1%.
Fears that $1.9 trillion dollar stimulus would overheat the economy have triggered a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields, derailing Wall Street’s main indexes from their peaks last month.
The Fed is expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The meet will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, where he is likely to reassure the economy can take off without generating excessive inflation.
While the Fed has reiterated it will remain dovish till the labor market fully recovers, eurodollar futures, which track short-term rate expectations, have priced a 90% chance of a rate hike by December 2022, with three hikes seen in 2023.
“Fed is more willing to allow inflation to run hot at the same time it wants to bond markets to not run past the current level,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
“If the Fed hints they would buy bonds at the longer end of the (Treasury yield) curve, it would help equities rally.”
The S&P 500 and the Dow on Monday reached all-time closing highs while the Nasdaq has recovered more than half of its losses since confirming a correction last week on optimism over the latest round of fiscal stimulus and vaccinations.
At 11:46 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.98 points, or 0.28%, to 32,916.93, the S&P 500 lost 19.84 points, or 0.50%, to 3,942.87 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 176.93 points, or 1.31%, to 13,294.64.
Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp slipped between 1.4% and 2.2% in a continuation of a rotation out of high-flying companies into last year’s laggards including financials, industrials and materials.
The banks index and airlines, expected to benefit from a reopening economy, added more than 1%.
“The play is value ... as the economy picks up, there is a lot more leverage in earnings growth for cyclical companies,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of the Wealth Alliance in New York.

Stocks rallied for a third day Thursday along with the rest of Asia after the Federal Reserve ramped up its outlook for the US economy but reiterated its pledge to maintain its ultra-loose market-friendly monetary policies for as long as needed. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 64.02 points, or 1 percent, to 6,630.85 on a value turnover of P8.8 billion. Gainers overwhelmed losers, 149 to 64, with 41 issues unchanged. Puregold Price Club Inc. of retail tycoon Lucio Co advanced 5.2 percent to P36.20, while SM Prime Holdings Inc. of the Sy Group climbed 3.7 percent to P36.30. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co., the second-biggest lender in terms of assets, rose 3.5 percent to P47.60, while Bank of the Philippine Islands, the third-largest bank, added 2.6 percent to P85.95. The rest of the Asian equities rallied. With growth already expected to burst higher this year, huge stimulus spending kicking in and vaccines being rolled out, investors have in recent weeks grown worried about a surge in inflation that could force the central bank to reconsider its dovish stance. But the Fed’s decision after its latest board meeting was music to the ears of traders. Policymakers forecast the world’s top economy to expand 6.5 percent this year, two percentage points above its earlier projection, thanks to trillions of dollars in government spending and the expected easing of lockdown measures that will allow people to get back to their daily lives. And, crucially, they continued to pledge that the record low interest rates that have been a key pillar of the year-long markets rally will not be touched for the foreseeable future. Wall Street rallied on the news, with the Dow ending above 33,000 for the first time, while the S&P 500 also chalked up a record.Asian trading floors were also upbeat. Hong Kong jumped 1.3 percent and Tokyo put on one percent, while Singapore and Jakarta put on more than one percent. Shanghai, Seoul, Taipei, and Bangkok also rose. Bank boss Jerome Powell told a news conference that while the recovery had been faster than expected, “the economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.” The Fed “will continue to provide the economy the support it needs for as long as it takes,” he said. And while some board members were edging towards a rate hike by 2023, investors were cheered by projections that borrowing costs will likely stay where they are until possibly 2024, even if inflation surges. “The overarching message from the Summary of Economic Projections and Chair Powell’s press conference was of greater optimism on the outlook but a central bank that is not in a hurry to raise rates,” said Axi strategist Stephen Innes. With AFP And Tai Hui, at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the Fed justified its decision to maintain its policy position by saying the impact of Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion will be felt this year and the economy would revert to normal from 2022. “It remains to be seen if this will be enough to convince investors with more hawkish inflation expectations, who may be fretting about a sustained rise in consumer prices,” he added.


Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with GDP growth likely to be a blow-out number that sets the stage for an historic experiment by U.S. central bank policymakers.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with GDP growth likely to be a blow-out number that sets the stage for an historic experiment by U.S. central bank policymakers.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are betting the economy can take off from the COVID-19 pandemic without generating excessive inflation, and have vowed to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and a spigot of money flowing for an extended period as they lean into a potential economic boom in a way not seen since the early 1970s.
In each of the quarterly forecasts released since June, the median GDP growth projection of Fed officials has been slightly above the median of private forecasters polled by Reuters. If that holds, it would translate into expected growth this year of more than 6.2% - the highest annual rate in 37 years.
GRAPHIC: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook -
But when they issue their policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials are expected to restate what they’ve promised for months now: to keep the central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and cash flowing into the economy until Americans are back to work, trusting that inflation will remain contained, as it has been for about 30 years.
The economic projections and policy statement are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell will hold a news conference shortly after, an event that could prove tricky for the Fed chief.
Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected. Some policymakers could even hint at that if new projections show more of them anticipate a rate increase sometime in 2023, rather than a year or more later.
If a majority see a 2023 hike, “Powell will have his work cut out for him” explaining how that meshes with a promise to get the economy back to full employment before reducing the crisis support rolled out when the pandemic struck, Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors, wrote this week.
Still, investors are already betting on earlier hikes, and some economists are also raising a red flag along with their forecasts. Morgan Stanley, among the more bullish in predicting the economy will have fully escaped its pandemic hole by September, sees the Fed’s approach producing a “hotter but shorter” business cycle that is likely to prompt it to tighten monetary policy early next year.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit a fresh 13-month high and U.S. stocks were trading largely lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the Fed meeting.
The coming cycle would be less like the last three expansions - the one ended by the pandemic lasted a decade - and more like the period after World War Two when the intervals between recessions were shorter and intervening growth stronger.
That epoch ended when then-President Richard Nixon encouraged loose monetary policy ahead of his 1972 re-election. Arthur Burns, who was the Fed chief at the time, kept interest rates low as the economy accelerated, and is often blamed for the ensuing rampant inflation that dogged the country for a decade.
This time is different, Fed officials argue. Indeed, Powell’s legacy may hinge on whether inflation remains tame as the economy recovers, or whether prices spike, forcing the central bank to pull back its support - perhaps with millions of Americans still out of work.
Their arguments are well-rehearsed. Inflation and unemployment don’t behave as they used to; lower levels of joblessness can now coexist with low inflation.
The Fed made substantial changes to its policy statement last year encompassing that thinking, and the guidance issued in December is expected to hold for now. It pledged to continue its monthly $120 billion of bond purchases until there was “substantial further progress” towards full employment and 2% inflation. Moreover, it said interest rates would not increase until those goals were actually met.
None of those things have happened yet, a point Powell has stressed recently and will likely again on Wednesday. The economy remains about 9 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level; the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, at 1.5%, is well short of its goal; a new index of slow-moving inflation expectations is also below target.
GRAPHIC: Substantial further progress for the Fed? -
‘CLEAR-EYED’
Still, it is a pivotal moment as Fed officials issue forecasts incorporating a bounty of new information.
Since their December projections, more than 100 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States and daily deaths due to the virus have fallen by two-thirds. Optimism has spiked, and states have begun lifting restrictions on businesses and reopening schools. Washington also has approved two new relief packages worth about $2.8 trillion, money now rolling into household and business bank accounts.
Much has changed since the Burns era, when wages and inflation were tightly linked, the economy relied more on manufacturing and imported oil, and unforeseen shocks from an oil embargo were just ahead. [Related graphic: here]
The Fed’s new approach, moreover, isn’t an in-the-moment response to political pressure, but a policy shift meant to reflect changes in the economy officials spent years studying.
With an emphasis on job creation and downplaying inflation, the new framework seemed well suited for the job market crisis spawned by the pandemic. The issue now is how it meshes with an economy that may recover faster than thought possible.
Analysts at BlackRock have praised the Fed for being “clear-eyed” about the economy’s problems during the pandemic and in its response to it.
But, wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, “at some point, the financial stability risks that emanate from an extremely low policy rate, coupled with the real economy boom that we expect, could in fact force the Fed’s hand.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was flat to slightly higher on Wednesday, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting fresh 13-month highs ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting which could shed some light on the timing of future rate hikes and the central bank’s tolerance for rising yields.

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
“The spike in U.S. yields dictated the positioning before the Fed,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at online FX broker OANDA.
“The market is anticipating a much more optimistic outlook by the Fed and with that you’re going to get higher Treasury yields, and that would be supportive for the dollar,” he added.
The U.S. benchmark 10-year note yield rose to a 13-month peak of 1.676% and was last up at 1.655%.
Ahead of the Fed statement later on Wednesday, eurodollar futures, which track short-term rate expectations, have priced a 90% chance of a rate hike by December 2022, with three hikes seen in 2023.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index was flat at 91.865.
The euro EUR=EBS was up 0.1% at $1.1912, after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3-1/2-month low of $1.1835.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies, which seem less dependent on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
The rouble fell 1.3% against the greenback to 73.78 per dollar, after U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin would face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was flat to slightly higher on Wednesday, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting fresh 13-month highs ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting which could shed some light on the timing of future rate hikes and the central bank’s tolerance for rising yields.

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
“The spike in U.S. yields dictated the positioning before the Fed,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at online FX broker OANDA.
“The market is anticipating a much more optimistic outlook by the Fed and with that you’re going to get higher Treasury yields, and that would be supportive for the dollar,” he added.
The U.S. benchmark 10-year note yield rose to a 13-month peak of 1.676% and was last up at 1.655%.
Ahead of the Fed statement later on Wednesday, eurodollar futures, which track short-term rate expectations, have priced a 90% chance of a rate hike by December 2022, with three hikes seen in 2023.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index was flat at 91.865.
The euro EUR=EBS was up 0.1% at $1.1912, after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3-1/2-month low of $1.1835.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies, which seem less dependent on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
The rouble fell 1.3% against the greenback to 73.78 per dollar, after U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin would face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump.

The Russian rouble weakened by more than 1% after U.S. President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will “pay a price” for directing efforts to meddle in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Fed policymakers are expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades as COVID-19 vaccinations rise and a $1.9 trillion relief package aids households.
Ahead of the Fed statement expected at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.676%.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”
On Wall Street, the rise in bond yields continued to pressure stocks, including tech and growth shares.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.85 points, or 0.02%, to 32,833.8, the S&P 500 lost 16.06 points, or 0.41%, to 3,946.65 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 96.22 points, or 0.71%, to 13,375.35.
“Market is of the view that the 10-year yield could be higher and if the Fed signals anything that matches that view, we could see yields jump past the 2% mark,” said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.51% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.43%.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 1.6497%, from 1.623% late on Tuesday.

The sell-off in the rouble intensified after Biden was quoted by ABC News as saying that Putin will face consequences for directing efforts to swing last year’s U.S. election in Donald Trump’s favor.
“There will be more sanctions coming, that is clear. The question is how severe?” said North Asset Management’s Peter Kisler.
Oil slipped for a fourth day as concerns about weaker demand in Europe outweighed an industry report that showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell last week.
U.S. crude recently fell 0.52% to $64.46 per barrel and Brent was at $67.93, down 0.67% on the day.


The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped on Wednesday as U.S. bond yields spiked ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement which could provide hints on whether the central bank would raise interest rates sooner than expected.

The benchmark 10-year yield ticked up to a new 13-month high of 1.676%, denting demand for some high-growth technology stocks and pressuring the tech-heavy Nasdaq by about 1%.
Fears that massive stimulus would overheat the economy has triggered a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields, derailing Wall Street’s main indexes from their peaks last month.
The Fed is expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The meet will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, where he is likely to reassure the economy can take off without generating excessive inflation.
While the Fed has reiterated it will remain dovish till the labor market fully recovers, some policymakers could hint at an increase in rates in 2023. Some investors and economists are betting on even earlier rate hikes, with Morgan Stanley predicting a tightening of monetary policy early next year.
“I don’t think investors believe that the Fed is going to change its stance but there are fears for inflation to jump in the near term,” said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.
“Market is of the view that the 10-year yield could be higher and if the Fed signals anything that matches that view, we could yields jump past the 2% mark.”
The S&P 500 and the Dow started off the week at all-time closing highs while the Nasdaq has recovered more than half of its losses since confirming a correction last week on optimism over the latest round of fiscal stimulus and vaccinations.
At 9:43 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.87 points, or 0.27%, to 32,913.82, the S&P 500 lost 16.59 points, or 0.42%, to 3,946.12 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 164.51 points, or 1.22%, to 13,307.06.
Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp slipped between 0.6% and 1.2% in a continuation of a rotation out of high-flying companies into last year’s laggards including financials, industrials and materials.
The banks index and airlines, expected to benefit from a reopening economy, added more than 1%.

Fast-food retailer McDonald’s gained nearly 1.5% after Deutsche Bank raised its target price on the stock and also upgraded its recommendation to “buy” from “hold”.

Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with an upgrade to GDP growth. Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected in raising rates.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have jumped from 0.953% at the beginning of the year to 1.67% on Wednesday, in the midst of the two-day policy meeting that began on Tuesday. The rise in yields in recent weeks came on optimism about the economic recovery and as the United States readied new fiscal stimulus.
However, a rapid rise in yields can ripple through to other assets, affecting everything from tech and financial stocks to the housing market.
Investors hoping for action from the Fed to cap rising yields on longer-dated Treasuries may be disappointed. While Powell has said he is watching recent Treasury market volatility, he brushed off concerns that the move up in yields might spell trouble for the Fed.
Here are what analysts are saying as the Fed meets:
MIZUHO SECURITIES USA
“There is a risk that the markets will again be disappointed by the post-meeting policy statement,” wrote Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC.
“The Fed’s new operating procedure of targeting maximum employment to finally achieve its 2% average inflation target is designed to see inflation expectations and long-term rates rise. This means policymakers are supportive of recent market developments, i.e. rising long-term rates,” he wrote.
RABOBANK
“The risks are... that long yields react further to all this “running hot,” wrote Michael Every, senior macro strategist, Rabobank. Even “a moderate move higher in yields could be painful – and not just to bonds,” Every wrote.
ING
"Bond investors will be wary of perceptions that the Fed could potentially allow the economy to run too hot for too long," wrote here James Knightley, Padhraic Garvey and Chris Turner, at ING, noting that inflation is "set to accelerate to well above 3%.
HSBC SECURITIES
“We expect the FOMC’s economic and rate projections will be in line with the bond market’s expectations,” wrote Lawrence Dyer, head of U.S. rates strategy and Shrey Singhal, fixed income strategist. “And, we do not expect the FOMC statement or press conference to provide pushback to the recent increase in yields. Thus, there should be a moderate market reaction to the announcement and press conference.”
STANDARD CHARTERED BANK
“We think the FOMC will have a hard time expressing concern about asset markets,” wrote Steve Englander and John Davies at Standard Chartered, while adding that if the Fed’s policy-setting committee and Powell do not “push back against current yield levels, investors are likely to take yields higher as better data arrives.”
NATWEST MARKETS
“Broader financial conditions remain easy, and luckily for (Powell) the U.S. rates market just got through a week of long supply relatively unscathed, at least until Friday, and Friday’s move did not negatively impact risk,” wrote John Briggsglobal head of strategy, NatWest Markets.
“What I do expect is for Powell to push back against the recent rise in the front end, dot move or not, which has pushed market pricing for the first hike to December 2022, from September 2023 at the beginning of the year.”
BANK OF AMERICA
“The Fed likely hopes market pricing is right, since it implies a faster recovery and more rapid attainment of its inflation and employment goals,” wrote Michelle Meyer, Mark Cabana, Ben Randol, Meghan Swiber and Stephen Juneau at Bank of America.
“Powell is likely to reiterate that higher rates are consistent with a re-pricing of fundamentals... Limited pushback on rate hike pricing will also likely be a disappointment for those expecting a continued ultra-dovish Fed, supporting higher belly rates.”
Intermediate-dated notes, known as the “belly” of the Treasury curve, are more sensitive to rate increases.

World stocks meanwhile headed lower and Russia’s rouble fell sharply after comments from U.S. President Joe Biden that Russian President Vladimir Putin “would pay a price” for election interference.
But market volatility is being contained by the upcoming Fed policy statement.
The central bank is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow at the fastest rate in decades in 2021 thanks to a $1.9 trillion fiscal boost and COVID-19 vaccine rollout. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy will probably be disappointed.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”
Before the Fed statement at 1800 GMT, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a fresh high at 1.67%, up more than 3 basis points on the day.
BIDEN VS PUTIN
Comments from Biden that Russia’s Putin will face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump caused some unease in markets.
U.S. stock market futures, which had been steady for much of the London session, slipped, pointing to a weak open for Wall Street. That in turn pressured European shares.
Russia’s rouble extended losses, falling more than 1% against the U.S. dollar, while bonds also faced selling pressure.
“There will be more sanctions coming, that is clear. The question is, how severe,” said North Asset Management fund manager Peter Kisler.
MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.2%, but still within sight of last month’s record highs. In Asia, an index of regional equities excluding Japan pulled back 0.4%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed flat.
There was some good news for AstraZeneca as Australia’s pharmaceutical regulator said rollout of the company’s COVID-19 shot would continue, even though many European nations have paused vaccinations to investigate reported side-effects.
BOND WATCHING
The rise in benchmark 10-year Treasury yields is the focal point for markets, coming ahead of the Fed statement.
They have risen 76 basis points so far this year versus a 26 bps increase in German peers and a 7 bps rise in Japanese borrowing costs.
Inflation expectations have also ticked higher, with the break-even rate on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) rising above 2.3% on Tuesday for the first time since July 2014. The break-even rate for 30-year TIPS hit 2.24%, the highest since September 2014.
Graphic: A steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve -
“The question is whether (Fed chief) Jerome Powell sees the steepening of the U.S. yield curve as appropriate,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
“The forecasts are likely to be revised up so it is hard to argue that the yield curve steepening is not appropriate. We have seen an increase in breakeven inflation in TIPS, too.”
In currencies, an index tracking the dollar against six major peers was firmer at around 91.95. The euro was weaker on the day at $1.1897. The dollar was up about 0.16% at 109.17 yen.
Elsewhere, oil prices slipped as concern about weaker demand in Europe outweighed an industry report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell last week. Brent crude futures fell 1% to $67.70 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped 0.9% to $64.23.


The U.S. dollar firmed on Wednesday with 10-year Treasury yields hitting fresh 13-month highs ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting which could shed some light on the timing of future rate hikes and the central bank’s tolerance for rising yields.

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
In any event, expectations of a faster-than-expected economic recovery will likely weigh.
“U.S. yields might receive further upwards thrust and pull the dollar along with them in the absence of a clear commitment on the part of the Fed that a further rise in yields is undesirable”, Commerzbank analyst Antje Praefcke wrote in a morning note.
She added that because the European Central Bank had in contrast committed to increasing the pace of bond buying to keep a lid on rising yields, the euro might suffer against the dollar in the short term.
By midday in Europe, Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields had crossed the 1.67% bar, their highest level since February 2020.
The euro was down 0.05% at $1.1896 after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.1835.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
“There is a risk that public trust on the vaccine has been compromised, and this may weigh on the euro as the vaccination gap between the EU and US may widen even further,” ING analysts warned.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies, which seem less dependent on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
At 1155 GMT, the dollar index was up 0.09% and stood at 91.952, having already risen for three straight sessions on support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields.
The rouble fell 1.5% against the dollar to 73.78 after U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin would face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump.
“They’re will be more sanctions coming, that is clear, the question is how severe,” said North Asset Management fund manager Peter Kisler.
Against the yen, the greenback firmed 0.18% to 109.19 yen, hovering near nine-month highs hit this week.
The British pound was up 0.04% at $1.3901 recovering from profit-taking after it hit a near three-year high last month on the back of a fast vaccine roll-out.
Commodity-linked currencies including the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the Canadian dollar traded lower against the U.S. dollar.
In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin fell 3.6% to $54,870.00, slipping further away from a record high of $61,781.83 hit on Saturday.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve has made it clear it is too soon to think about pulling back on stimulus for the pandemic-battered economy, but finds itself stuck between an improving outlook and inflation fears.
The US central bank will wrap up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, where it will likely comment on the accelerations in COVID-19 vaccine campaigns and reopening of businesses, which are fueling optimism that life in the United States can return to normal.

And into that improving economy comes a flood of government funds: A US$1.9 trillion relief package President Joe Biden signed last week, and the remainder of the US$900 billion measure approved in December.
Economists expect that influx of cash to shore up businesses and boost spending, but markets worry it will bring with it an upward spiral of prices.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance at his post-meeting news conference to allay those concerns and repeat his assertion that while prices will rise this year, any spikes from the depressed levels of 2020 will be transitory and no reason for the bank to take action.
In fact, the Fed wants prices to rise to some extent, since they have lagged below its 2 per cent target for years.

The Fed faces "a delicate balancing act," BNP Paribas chief economist William De Vijlder said.
Members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are expected to raise their economic projections from December to take into account the stimulus and improving outlook.
But De Vijlder said that will just "add fuel to the fire" of potential price increases and cause yields on US Treasury debt to rise again - the inflationary red flag that has sent stock markets on a roller-coaster ride in recent weeks.
Powell has made it clear the Fed will wait until employment has recovered and inflation is securely above 2 per cent before it will roll back its easy money policy.

And he notes it has the tools to ward off any uncontrolled price spike.
"Fed officials would happily raise rates to cool what would be an overheating economy for the first time in, well, decades," Grant Thornton economist Diane Swonk said.
"That would mark a policy achievement for the Fed, rather than the failure the bond market is anticipating."
But she noted that this crisis is unique so "we can't completely rule out a more vicious inflation cycle".
Powell's "hardest job" will be to clarify the central bank's plans when faced with "a temporary flare in inflation this spring and summer".


Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow were subdued on Wednesday as investors held their breath ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy statement which could provide hints on whether the central bank would be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected.

(Reuters) - Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Dow were subdued on Wednesday as investors held their breath ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement which could provide hints on whether the central bank would be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected.
The S&P 500 and the Dow started off the week at all-time closing highs while the Nasdaq has recovered more than half of its losses since confirming a correction last week on the back of latest round of fiscal stimulus and vaccinations.
Wall Street’s major indexes were derailed from their peaks last month as record public borrowings stoked inflation fears, leading to a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields.
The Fed is betting the economy can take off from the COVID-19 pandemic without generating excessive inflation, and has vowed to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels till the labor market reaches pre-pandemic levels.
Policymakers are expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) which will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference shortly after.
“There is a decent chance that the rates forecasts from the 18 members committee could start focusing on a 2023 hike which would be quite a surprise, that Chairman Powell would then try to walk back in his speech,” said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
The benchmark 10-year yield ticked up to a new 13-month high of 1.646% ahead of the policy decision, denting demand for some high-growth technology stocks.
Apple Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Corp slipped between 0.2% and 0.6% in premarket trading.
At 06:37 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 33 points, or 0.09%, S&P 500 E-minis were down 1 point, or 0.03% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 28 points, or 0.21%.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield topped 1.64% early on Wednesday, ahead of the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.644% at 6 a.m. ET. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.395%. Yields move inversely to prices.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield topped 1.64% early on Wednesday, ahead of a press conference with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in which he will comment on the central bank's two-day policy meeting.
The Federal Open Market Committee's two-day policy meeting is set to conclude at 2 p.m. ET, followed by a press conference with Powell.
The Fed will release new economic and interest rate forecasts, which could indicate Fed officials expect to raise rates by, or even before, 2023. The central bank is expected to acknowledge stronger growth, which should put the Fed's easy policies in the spotlight, especially given the new $1.9 trillion in federal stimulus spending.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday morning, that he would be "astonished" if the Fed signaled that it would step in to dampen rising bond yields at these levels.
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen rapidly recently amid concerns about potential growth in inflation, as economies reopen and recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The 10-year yield has jumped more than half a percent since the end of January, hitting 1.6% in the past couple of weeks.
However, Shepherdson highlighted that this was "still close to zero in real terms."
Shepherdson believed that while Powell would once again push back on some of the market's inflation fears, he suggested the Fed chairman wouldn't talk about tapering its bond buying program in Wednesday's press conference.
He explained that this is because "as soon as the Fed starts talking about tapering, then yields will rocket immediately because that's what markets do — you give markets an inch and they take a yard — especially in Treasuries at moment."
"So the Fed therefore I think wants to keep this talk really dampened down as much as they possibly can until they can't," he added.
Shepherdson pointed out that this lack of indication from the Fed on when any policy changes might come was "kind of justifiable because this recovery is still a forecast."

Far from fighting the Federal Reserve, bond markets have in many ways been remarkably well behaved and are acting right on cue. What's not for the Fed to like?
LONDON (Reuters) - Far from fighting the Federal Reserve, bond markets have in many ways been remarkably well behaved and are acting right on cue. What’s not for the Fed to like?

Part of the market narrative of recent weeks has been that the Fed had somehow lost control of the U.S. Treasury bond market, allowing traders to become restive due to a lack of hard guidance, fear of excessive stimulus and inflation anxiety.
As borrowing rates backed up to pre-pandemic levels - already historically low levels before COVID-19 hit - and unsettled stock markets that have lapped up the idea of emergency borrowing rates for years to come, Fed officials refused to protest the move or offer the prospect of even more support.
Fed policymakers, who are concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, may well address technical money market disturbances from the rundown of Treasury’s bank account at the U.S. central bank - something flooding banks with excess reserves and raising questions about extending relief on their resulting purchases of more Treasury securities.
But even if this factor was the root of recent bond market ructions, the Fed’s fundamental message on its new average inflation targetting regime seems to be getting through just fine.
Not only are Fed officials expecting a temporary snapback in inflation to as high as 3% over the coming year, they are positively targetting 2%-plus so their average target is met by a symmetric period above that level matching the long periods stuck below it.
That’s the whole point of the strategy rethink - allowing the economy to run hot for periods to eat up accumulated slack and joblessness from periods of sluggish or sub-par growth.
And so while inflation fears grip the headlines, bond market pricing merely apes that objective rather than threatening it.
With oil prices more than double where they were at the nadir of the first pandemic-related lockdowns last year, forecast base effects on headline inflation will be sparky and unpredictable for several months - possibly even exaggerated later in the year by bottlenecks during the re-opening of shuttered services and travel.
But expectations embedded in inflation-protected bonds and in swaps markets show the five-year view similar to one-year indications of inflation around 2.50%.
While that’s a percentage point higher than 2019 levels and the highest since just before the banking crash of 2008, it’s in the ballpark of what the Fed’s been aiming at and shows just how long expectations skulked below target for the past decade.
Crucially, 10-year and 30-year equivalent expectations subside again to about 2.20/2.25%. And 10- and 30-year nominal bond yields of 1.6% and 2.4% are hardly excessive given they have room to move higher without cries about disjointed pricing.
It seems unlikely the Fed will be unnerved by a wobble in a stock market that is still near record highs and where worries about bubbles and one-way pricing were the bigger investor and policymaker fears only a month ago.
GRAPHIC: Tolerated Inflation Hump? -

FED IN CONTROL?
Where there is a challenge to Fed communication is market pricing for an interest rate hike at the tail end of next year - an aggressive take that flies in the face of the central bank’s signals that no move is likely on interest rates until 2023.
Were the Fed to push back hard on that, perhaps relatively benign inflation thinking may go up a notch too.
Beyond this week’s policy meeting, a wider worry is that what’s good for the Fed may not be for the rest of the world and the latter comes back to haunt Washington anyhow.
That’s partly a result of the still dominant role of the dollar and U.S. Treasury market in world finance - something Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet Yellen has previously said influenced Fed thinking in the past.
Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen thinks that should throw down the gauntlet to global fiscal authorities to mirror the ambition of President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion spending package, which was enacted last week.
“For now, Biden and the Fed can sit back a bit and enjoy the spectacle of a much faster U.S. recovery, while the world of foreign governments, central banks and markets try to figure out how to react to this new and bold U.S. policy approach.”
But angst about loose policy settings and markets fighting the Fed remain largely a discussion of risk than a reality of pricing.
Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey showed more than 90% of respondents think “higher than expected inflation” is the biggest tail risk to investor positioning and a bond market “tantrum” the second.
Yet at the same time, they reckoned the 10-year Treasury bond would need to rise another 40 basis points to trigger even a 10% equity correction.
Deutsche Bank’s latest global outlook sees that yield move happening by the summer. But it reckoned a persistent overshoot of U.S. inflation in the 3% to 4% range would be needed to “elicit a strong response from the Fed” that would hit world markets hard.
As it stands - its central forecast is for U.S. inflation to end this year at 2.6% before subsiding to 2.1% by 2023.
And if that proves to be the case, the Fed can remain smug that it’s getting what it wants.

The U.S. central bank ends a closely anticipated two-day meeting later in the day, after a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields this year on expectations for stronger growth and inflation.
The Fed is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy will probably be disappointed.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”
Before the Fed statement at 1800 GMT, calm prevailed across world markets.
MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.1%, but keeping last month’s record highs within sight.
European shares were a touch softer, while in Asia, an index of regional equities excluding Japan pulled back 0.4%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed flat.
There was some good news for AstraZeneca as Australia’s pharmaceutical regulator said the rollout of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine would continue, even though many European nations have paused vaccinations to investigate reported side-effects.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street, after the S&P 500 lost 0.16% on Tuesday.
DOVISH?
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were a touch higher at 1.63%, holding near 13-month highs reached on Friday. They have risen 72 basis points so far this year. That compares with a 24 bps increase in German peers and a 7 bps rise in Japanese borrowing costs.
Inflation expectations have also ticked higher with the break-even rate on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) on Tuesday rising above 2.3% for the first time since July 2014. The break-even rate for 30-year TIPS hit 2.24%, the highest since September 2014.
“We expect (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell to note the FOMC has the tools to intervene if the bond market becomes disorderly or constrains the economic recovery,” analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote.
“But we expect Powell to push back against talk of policy tightening because of the large amount of labour market slack ... U.S. bond yields and the U.S. dollar could jump if the FOMC’s post‑meeting statement and Powell’s statement are not deemed dovish enough.”
An index tracking the dollar against six major peers was around 91.92. The euro was weaker on the day at $1.1892. The dollar was up about 0.1% at 109.13 yen.
Currency market caution may extend all week, with the Bank of England meeting on Thursday and the Bank of Japan wrapping up a policy review on Friday, in which it may phase out a numerical target for its asset buying.
Elsewhere, oil prices slipped for a fourth day as concern about weaker demand in Europe outweighed an industry report that showed U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell last week.
Brent crude futures fell 27 cents to $68.12 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped 14 cents to $64.65.

Speculation Fed may be forced into adjustment of the levers controlling its policy rate
Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, tracking Wall Street as investors waited to see if the US Federal Reserve will signal a faster path toward policy normalisation than previously expected.
The US central bank ends a two-day meeting later in the day.
An index of regional equities excluding Japan pulled back 0.5 per cent, led by declines in South Korea’s Kospi.
The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.3 per cent.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was flat to slightly lower, while the broader Topix index bucked the trend to rise 0.1 per cent.
European stocks were set to open weaker, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.1 per cent. FTSE futures also edged lower in early deals.
Global markets have been knocked in recent weeks by a rout in treasuries that saw the benchmark yield soar to a more than one-year high as bond investors bet accelerating Covid-19 vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus would spur faster-than-expected growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.
The volatility stoked speculation the Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment to the levers controlling its policy rate, but few expect the central bank to act on the matter at this week’s meeting, even if it releases rosier growth forecasts.
“We expect (chair Jerome) Powell to note the FOMC has the tools to intervene if the bond market becomes disorderly or constrains the economic recovery,” analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote.
“But we expect Powell to push back against talk of policy tightening because of the large amount of labour market slack ... US bond yields and the USD could jump if the FOMC’s post-meeting statement and Powell’s statement are not deemed dovish enough.”
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields continued to consolidate around 1.6 per cent, standing at 1.6268 per cent on Wednesday in Asia. They reached 1.6420 per cent on Friday for the first time since February of last year.
An index tracking the dollar against six major peers held at around 91.90 following its retreat from a three-month high of 92.506, touched last week.
Currency market caution may extend all week, with the Bank of England announcing its policy decision on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan wrapping up a policy review on Friday in which it may phase out a numerical target for its asset buying.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.39 per cent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.16 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.09 per cent.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.04 per cent on Wednesday.
Gold prices edged up to hover at their highest in more than two weeks on prospects of higher inflation.
Spot gold was up about 0.3 per cent at $1,736.55 per ounce.
Brent crude futures rose 33 cents to $68.72 a barrel and US crude futures added 40 cents to $65.20 a barrel. – Reuters

The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.3% lower, trading below a one-year peak after a cautious session in Asian markets.
The Fed’s monetary policy stance will be closely watched after a recent run-up in Treasury yields stoked concerns about a pick-up in inflation as the U.S. economy rebounds from pandemic lows. The central bank’s policy statement and economic forecasts are due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
“The Fed at this point probably thinks that the impact of the high yield is relatively modest on the stock market,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at BCA Research in London.
“They will stick to their narrative, and only if there is a big sort of pushback in the market crisis, would they intervene aggressively.”
A move into some of the cheaply valued sectors such as banks and energy has pushed European stocks closer to record levels hit last year, with investors counting on vaccination drives and stimulus measures to spur a strong global rebound this year.

Emerging market stocks and currencies fell on Wednesday as investors focussed on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal policy tightening, while Russia's rouble was set for its worst session in two weeks on possible U.S. sanctions.
Emerging market stocks and currencies fell on Wednesday as investors focussed on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal policy tightening, while Russia's rouble was set for its worst session in two weeks on possible U.S. sanctions. After touching its highest in nearly seven months last session, the rouble fell 0.2% following a U.S. intelligence report that showed Moscow likely directed efforts to try to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump. Sources said it could trigger U.S. sanctions on Russia as soon as next week.
"The sanctions won't probably be that bad, and also as Russia has the financial means to whether the sanctions, it won't be such a big shock for the rouble," said Jakob Christensen, chief analyst and head of EM research at Danske Bank. "We are cautiously optimistic on the rouble, we think rouble is set to strengthen over the coming months relative to other EM currencies," he said, as a hawkish central bank and oil prices should help more fundamentally.

The latest threat comes after the United States and European Union imposed sanctions, albeit limited, over the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. MSCI's index of EM currencies was down 0.1%, while the stocks counterpart slipped 0.4%, both down for the third day in four.
The dollar held steady ahead of the Fed decision due at 02:00 p.m. ET. Eyes will be on the reaction of U.S. Treasury yields. Investors will be looking for any comments on whether the Fed expects a stimulus-induced likely spurt in economic growth to cause inflation to rise enough to warrant a change in their policy stance earlier than expected, or if they would take action to control a recent sell-off in Treasuries.
The Chinese yuan inched higher, while most other Asian currencies dipped into the red. South Africa's rand led losses among the most commonly watched EM currencies, down 0.5%, while Turkey's lira gave up 0.1%, positioning itself around 7.50 ahead of a key central bank meeting on Thursday.
At Brazil's central bank meeting on Wednesday, a hike in interest rates by 50-75 basis points is expected, which would be Brazil's first hike in six years. The real is among the worst-performing EM currencies year-to-date, thanks to worries about fiscal spending, political interference, and rising inflation.

The U.S. dollar firmed on Wednesday with 10-year Treasury yields close to 13-month highs ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting which could shed some light on the timing of future rate hikes and the central bank’s tolerance for rising yields.
LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar firmed on Wednesday with 10-year Treasury yields close to 13-month highs ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting which could shed some light on the timing of future rate hikes and the central bank’s tolerance for rising yields.

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
In any event, expectations of a faster-than-expected economic recovery will likely weigh.
“U.S. yields might receive further upwards thrust and pull the dollar along with them in the absence of a clear commitment on the part of the Fed that a further rise in yields is undesirable”, Commerzbank Antje Praefcke analyst wrote in a morning note.
She added that because the European Central Bank had in contrast committed to increase the pace of bond buying to keep a lid on rising yields, the euro might suffer against the dollar in the short term.
The euro was down 0.07% at $1.1893 after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies which seem less dependant on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
In morning trades in Europe, the dollar index ticked up 0.09% and stood at 91.953, having already risen for three straight sessions on support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were also ticking up at 1.6340%. They had reached 1.6420% on Friday for the first time since February 2020.
Against the yen, the greenback firmed 0.15% to 109.14 yen, hovering near nine-month highs hit this week.
The British pound was up 0.14% at $1.3914 recovering from profit-taking after it hit a near three-year high last month on the back of a fast vaccine rollout.

Euro zone bond yields inched higher, following U.S. Treasuries ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting later on Wednesday.
* Euro area bond moves subdued ahead of Fed
* Greece expected to launch first 30-year bond since 2008
AMSTERDAM, March 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields inched higher, following U.S. Treasuries ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting later on Wednesday.
U.S. benchmark Treasury yields ticked up in early London trade, nearing recent 13-month highs as investors awaited the Fed’s latest policy decision. The Fed is in focus as expectations that vast U.S. fiscal stimulus will boost economic growth and cause inflation to rebound have pushed government bond yields higher in recent weeks.
Markets will be focusing on the Fed’s so-called “dot plot”, which shows the outlook for its policy rate. While some economists expect this will show one rate hike for 2023 versus none in December, an unchanged median dot for that year could be interpreted as Fed push-back against the recent bond market sell-off.
“With the FOMC meeting looming large as potential catalyst for the next move in Treasuries, EUR markets are unlikely to venture far with data calendars otherwise void,” ING analysts told clients, referring to the Fed.
With euro area bonds continuing to outperform Treasuries on Wednesday, analysts said the European Central Bank’s decision to accelerate its pandemic emergency bond purchases last week, and delays in the bloc’s vaccine roll-out topped by a temporary halt to AstraZeneca vaccinations were keeping bond yields subdued in the bloc.
At 0807 GMT, Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the bloc, was unchanged at -0.34%.
Italian 10-year yields were also unchanged at 0.63%, keeping the closely watched risk premium over German equivalents at 95 basis points.
Focus is also on the primary market on Wednesday, where Greece is expected to launch its first new 30-year bond since 2008 after hiring a syndicate of banks on Tuesday.
Luxembourg is also selling a new 10-year bond via a syndicate of banks, according to a lead manager memo seen by Reuters.
In auctions, Germany will re-open a 30-year bond to raise 1.5 billion euros, while Italy will offer a bond due 2031 in exchange for four bonds expiring later this year. (Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli; Editing by Giles Elgood)

March 17 (Reuters) - British shares slipped on Wednesday, dragged by miners and energy stocks, as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy meeting for clues about interest rates.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.1%, with mining stocks, including Rio Tinto, Anglo American , and BHP Group, falling between 0.5% and 1%.
Oil heavyweights BP and Royal Dutch Shell were also among the laggards.
A spate of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation the Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment to the levers controlling its benchmark interest rate to ensure that it does not fall too low, but few expect the central bank to act on the matter at this week’s meeting.
The domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 index fell 0.3%, dragged by consumer discretionary and financials stocks.
Retail investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown rose 3.2%, as it expects its profit for the year ending June 30 to be “modestly” above analyst estimates.
