 The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy event and more corporate earnings will remain on TSX investors’ radar today."
56,"TSX Today: What to Watch for in Stocks on Wednesday, May 1
 Canadian equities fell sharply on Tuesday after steep intraday declines in commodity prices, weak U.S. consumer confidence numbers, and mixed corporate results took a toll on investors’ sentiments."
57,"As Canada’s 10-year treasury bond yields resumed their upward trend, the S&P/TSX Composite Index dived by 297 points, or 1.3%, yesterday to settle at 21,715 — marking its biggest single-day decline since mid-February."
58,"While favourable marijuana industry-related news from the United States led to an extraordinary rally in cannabis stocks, huge losses in other key sectors like metal mining, energy, and industrials weighed on the TSX benchmark."
59,"With this, the TSX index fell 2% in April 2024, ending its five-month winning streak."
60,"Top TSX Composite movers and active stocks
 Ivanhoe Mines (TSX:IVN) tanked 9.5% to $18.66 per share after announcing its first-quarter financial results and gave updates on the ongoing construction and exploration activities."
61,"For the March quarter, the Vancouver-headquartered mining firm posted a loss of $69 million, primarily due to a non-cash loss from convertible bonds with a 26% quarterly share price increase."
62,"On the positive side, Ivanhoe’s Kamoa-Kakula mine sold 85,155 tonnes of copper, helping it generate $618 million in revenue."
63,The company also highlighted that the pre-commissioning of Kamoa-Kakula’s Phase 3 concentrator and Kipushi zinc concentrator is ahead of schedule.
64,Ivanhoe now plans to accelerate the Kamoa-Kakula expansions due to high copper demand forecasts.
65,"Despite yesterday’s sharp declines, IVN stock is still up over 45% on a year-to-date basis."
66,"NexGen Energy, OceanaGold, and Cameco were also among the worst-performing TSX stocks yesterday as they plunged by at least 7% each."
67,"On the flip side, Tilray Brands (TSX:TLRY) popped by around 42% to $3.42 per share, making it the top-performing TSX stock for the day."
68,"This rally in TLRY, along with most other cannabis stocks, came after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed reclassifying cannabis as a Schedule Three drug, indicating a lower risk of dependence."
69,"This potential shift in classification could lead to significant changes in federal cannabis policy, which may benefit large cannabis companies, including Tilray."
70,"On a year-to-date basis, TLRY stock is now up about 12%."
71,"Restaurant Brands International and Cargojet also rose by at least 2.7% each, making them among the day’s top-performing stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange."
72,"Based on their daily trade volume, Enbridge, Ivanhoe Mines, First Quantum Minerals, Tilray, and TD Bank were the most active stocks on the exchange."
73,"TSX today
 Most commodity prices were trading on a bearish note early Wednesday morning, which could pressure the resource-heavy main TSX index at the open today."
74,"Canadian investors may want to keep a close eye on the latest manufacturing, job openings, and non-farm employment data from the United States this morning."
75,"However, the market’s key focus will shift to the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy statement and press conference this afternoon, which could give further direction to TSX stocks today."
76,"As the quarterly corporate earnings season also heats up in Canada, several TSX-listed companies, including Franco-Nevada, GFL Environmental, Lundin Mining, Badger Infrastructure Solutions, Gildan Activewear, Great-West Lifeco, Primaris REIT, Russel Metals, Vermilion Energy, Toromont Industries, Capital Power, CGI, Cenovus Energy, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, Barrick Gold, Fortis, Loblaw Companies, Parkland, and Tourmaline Oil, are likely to announce their latest quarterly results on May 1."

 Stock index futures fell on Wednesday, as the market seemed jittery ahead of the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s rate decision and the chair, Jerome Powell&amp;#39;s speech later in
 Stock index futures were lower Wednesday following disappointing earnings reports postmarket Tuesday and with the Fed decision in view."
78,"S&P 500 futures (SPX) -0.4%, Nasdaq 100 futures (US100:IND) -0.6% and Dow futures (INDU) -0.2%."
79,"AMD (AMD), Super Micro (SMCI) and Starbucks (SBUX) weighed on futures following earnings reports, while Amazon (AMZN) lent some support."
80,Super Micro Computer (SMCI) was down more than 10% as it missed its quarterly revenue estimates.
81,"AMD (AMD) also slipped by 6.5% in premarket trade, after the semiconductor firm reported first-quarter results and guidance that were largely in-line with expectations."
82,The 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) dipped by 1 basis points to 4.68%.
83,The 2-year yield (US2Y) was unchanged at 5.04%.
84,"The Fed's two-day meeting will conclude today, and the FOMC is expected to announce its policy decision at 2:00 pm ET, with Powell's press conference scheduled for 2:30 pm ET."
85,"It is widely accepted that rates will be held steady, but investors will be eagerly waiting for the press conference to look for hints on the Fed's path in the year."
86,"""In terms of the Fed’s decision, it’s widely expected that they’ll leave rates unchanged today."
87,"But given the recent inflation data, our US economists think there’ll be a more hawkish-leaning message, echoing chair Powell’s view that it will take longer to gain confidence about disinflation,"" said Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid."
88,"""The key market-moving moment will likely be when Fed Chair Powell is probed on how the economy and inflation are evolving relative to the FOMC’s expectations of three cuts,"" said Steve Englander of Standard Chartered."
89,"Englander expects a formulation that says the FOMC still broadly sees policy rate cuts as the base case for its next move, but there is no hurry on such cuts."
90,"""The assumption is that chair Powell will pour cold water on hopes of near-term policy easing and concede that inflation is above target and sticky while growth is resilient,"" said Kit Juckes, FX strategist, Societe Generale."
91,"""Chair Powell is unlikely to slam the door definitively on a June rate cut at his press conference today, but he will leave markets in no doubt that the data over the next six weeks would have to be extraordinary in order to push the FOMC into action,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics."
92,"The economic calendar is on the heavier side today, with the April ADP jobs report due before the bell."
93,Economists expected a fall to 179K in private payrolls.
94,"The April PMI manufacturing index is expected a little after the market opens, and is forecasted to drop to 49.9."

96,"Pantheon Macro also advised traders to ignore the ADP job report, and expect a soft ISM."
97,"The job openings and labor turnover survey, or JOLTS, will hit during market open, and openings are expected to fall to 8.680M."
98,"""The broader trend remains one of falling job openings, consistent with a loosening labor market,"" added Pantheon Macro."
99,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates at their current levels Wednesday, as hotter-than-expected inflation data continues to push back the timing of the first rate cut."
100,"Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding interest rates at their current levels, as hotter-than-expected inflation data continues to push back the timing of the first rate cut."
101,"Fed officials have kept their benchmark lending rate at a 23-year high since July, after aggressively raising rates starting two years ago."
102,"Officials have said they need to have enough confidence that inflation is under control before lowering borrowing costs, but the latest figures show “there has been a lack of further progress,” according to their latest policy statement."
103,US stocks closed mixed Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated twice during a news conference that policymakers believe interest rates are “restrictive” enough and that it was “unlikely” that the central bank would raise rates again in this cycle.
104,"The blue-chip Dow ended Wednesday higher by 87 points, or 0.2%."
105,The S&P 500 fell by 0.3% and the Nasdaq was also down 0.3%.
106,The Fed also announced Wednesday it is easing its grip on the economy by shrinking its massive multitrillion-dollar balance sheet at a slower pace.
107,"The central bank’s main tool is its key interest rate, but it also uses its balance sheet to either help stimulate or slow the economy, and it’s been doing the latter to fight inflation."
108,"Starting in June, the Fed will let up to $25 billion in Treasuries from its portfolio mature each month without replacing them, down from $60 billion a month currently."
109,Here are key takeaways from Powell’s latest comments and what to expect from the Fed in the coming months.
110,"Powell says another rate hike is unlikely
 Chair Powell first acknowledged that inflation’s slowdown has stalled during a discussion last month."
111,He continued to express that sentiment Wednesday.
112,"“So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence."
113,"In particular, as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations,” Powell said, adding that it might “take longer than previously expected” for Fed officials to feel confident enough to cut rates."
114,"The string of disappointing inflation figures not only dealt some serious damage to the chances of a rate cut in the summer, but it also sparked chatter about the possibility of another rate hike."
115,"But Powell said that “it’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike,” noting that officials would need to see “persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2%.”
 His view on the timing of rate cuts
 It is very unclear when the Fed will finally begin to reduce interest rates, but Powell said there are multiple scenarios that could kick off rate cuts, including a scenario in which inflation resumes its slowdown as both the economy and job market remain strong — the “Goldilocks” type of situation that took place last year."
116,"He said a persistently strong economy, coupled with inflation continuing to stall, would simply result in the Fed holding off on cutting rates, but added that an “unexpected weakening in the labor market” could speed up the first cut."
117,"The job market overall remains robust, with unemployment still under 4% and employers continuing to hire workers at a brisk pace."
118,"The Labor Department releases April figures on hiring, wage gains and unemployment on Friday."
119,"When asked if he still agrees with Fed officials’ median projection of three rate cuts in 2024, Powell did not provide a direct answer."
120,"Still betting that inflation will keep slowing
 Economists are still widely expecting both inflation and the broader US economy to cool further in the second half of the year."
121,Powell thinks so too.
122,"Interest rates are high, pandemic savings are dwindling, Americans are racking up credit card debt and still-high inflation continues to take a bite out of people’s budgets."
123,All of that is expected to tug on the economy’s reins in the coming months.
124,"The Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign has already had some effects on certain pockets of the economy, such as housing and business deal-making."
125,"Mortgage rates soared as the Fed hiked rates, leading to home sales plummeting to their lowest level in decades last fall."
126,Mergers and acquisitions slowed sharply in the second half of 2022 as the Fed lifted rates.
127,Powell also pointed to the labor market’s gradual slowdown from 2022 when job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people seeking work by the widest margin in history.
128,"Still, the broader economy hasn’t felt the full effects of high interest rates just yet."
129,"The economy expanded robustly in 2023, thanks to strong household spending, despite the Fed jacking up to rates to their current levels."
130,The solid job market was key in powering spending last year and there currently aren’t any signs of a sharp pullback on the horizon.
131,"But inflation is stuck and, coupled with the economy’s resilience, the Fed is expected to push back the timing of the first rate cut, according to futures and forecasts from analysts at major banks."
132,"JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are projecting the first cut to come in July, while Wells Fargo is betting on September and Bank of America estimates the first cut in December."
133,"Wall Street’s best bet for the first rate cut is currently November, according to the CME FedWatch Tool."
134,Economists say the bar for another rate hike is very high and most forecasters currently aren’t estimating that.
135,Powell is waiting on private data showing declining rents eventually trickled through to government inflation gauges.
136,The Fed chief also hinted that the economy is not in stagflation.
137,"“I don’t really understand where that’s coming from,” he said."
138,The Federal Reserve will give an announcement on interest rates during its May meeting Wednesday.
139,"But inflation is still high, so don’t get your hopes up."
140,Even borrowing money is more expensive these days — and the Federal Reserve might decide to keep it that way for a while.
141,"All eyes are on the Fed’s May meeting today, where Fed chair Jerome Powell will make an announcement about interest rates."
142,"Though analysts do not expect the Fed to cut rates just yet, some had projected a cut might be coming soon."
143,That now appears increasingly unlikely.
144,"Instead, his remarks are expected to shed light on how much longer the US economy will have to endure high interest rates, which are squeezing everyone from prospective home buyers to people who have racked up credit card debt."
145,"High interest rates have helped cool a too-hot economy, significantly bringing down inflation to 3.5 percent from its 9.1 percent peak in June 2022."
146,"But it’s still well above the Fed’s target rate of 2 percent, and inflation has increased slightly in the last few months, which means we might not see a rate cut anytime soon."
147,"“The ‘last mile’ ... to the Fed’s target range was expected to be more difficult than what came before it,” said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics."
148,"“Even with that expectation, however, inflation data in the first three months of 2024 has been surprisingly high.”
 Why inflation has remained high
 A few factors are driving stubborn inflation."
149,Housing costs have been the biggest contributor by far.
150,"Inflation in rent and homeowners’ cost of living in their own homes has moderated somewhat but by less than expected, Colyar said."
151,Auto insurance and repair costs have also risen sharply even though car prices have fallen.
152,And health care costs have also picked up.
153,"But this isn’t necessarily a “strong indication that inflation will remain similarly high for the rest of 2024,” Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said in a note to investors Friday."
154,"The US economy has so far staved off a recession, growing at a slower but still solid pace in the first quarter of 2024 in part because Americans are continuing to spend a lot."
155,"The job market also remains strong, with the US blowing past projections to add 303,000 jobs in March."
156,That hasn’t given the Fed much urgency to cut rates anytime soon.
157,"“It’s not an economy in obvious need of the pick-me-up that a rate cut would deliver,” Colyar said."
158,"Strong consumer spending, though, isn’t expected to last as Americans deplete any savings they accrued in the pandemic and rack up more household debt."
159,"That will likely cause US economic growth to slow in the coming year, which “should be sufficient to cool off remaining excess inflation,” Caldwell told Vox."
160,When will the Fed cut interest rates?
161,"After the Fed’s December meeting, financial analysts were expecting six interest rate cuts in 2024, beginning in June."
162,"But given that inflation has remained high and the economy is still going strong, that doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon."
163,Caldwell said he’s now expecting three cuts this year starting in September.
164,"Other top economists at UBS, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America have also pushed back their projections for a rate cut."
165,"For example, Bank of America is projecting only a single rate cut in December."
166,"Some Fed officials also have not ruled out the possibility of another rate hike, which would be the first since last July."
167,"Fed Governor Michelle Bowman recently said she would support a rate hike “should progress on inflation stall or even reverse.”
 But Caldwell said that still seems a far-off possibility."
168,"“The mere fact that they’re delaying rate cuts already has a contractionary effect on the economy,” he said."
169,"Colyar said he will be watching Powell’s remarks to discern “how spooked they have been by the hotter-than-expected inflation data in the first quarter” and to what extent he attributes the stickiness of inflation to a few industries, rather than an indication of current overall cost pressures."
170,"What continued higher interest rates might mean for the economy
 Recent economic data has already dampened earlier enthusiasm in the stock market about an imminent interest rate cut."
171,"Powell’s remarks might have a similar depressive effect, depending on how pessimistic he is about the Fed winning its battle against inflation in the near term."
172,"“The first effect is psychological,” Colyar said."
173,"“Persistently high borrowing costs are painful and will eventually break something.”
 It’s already slowing down the real estate market significantly."
174,"Mortgage rates have surpassed 7 percent, and that’s keeping prospective home buyers and sellers on the bench."
175,"People who secured lower interest rates just a few years ago don’t want to sell and would have to secure a higher-rate mortgage for their new lodging, so there are fewer homes on the market, keeping prices higher than many buyers can afford."
176,"Americans’ total credit card debt also hit a record $1.13 trillion earlier this year, and repaying that in a high interest rate environment is bound to hurt their wallets."
177,"At the same time, the US economy has proved resilient even in a high interest rate environment."
178,"The Fed doesn’t need to step in just yet given steady job growth and economic growth, as well as strong consumer spending."
179,"“However, I would argue that the time to start loosening policy is before things are flashing red,” Colyar said."
180,"“Waiting too long because shelter prices are slow in moderating I think is an unnecessary risk.”

197,"As a result, some in the party are pressing President Joe Biden to publicly browbeat Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for holding rates at a two-decade high, in an attempt to deflect blame for the high borrowing costs weighing on voters’ pocketbooks."
198,"Unlike his Republican rival Donald Trump, who routinely criticized Mr. Powell when he was in the White House and threatened to oust the Fed chair if he wins in November, Mr. Biden has steadfastly respected the central bank’s independence and refrained from back-seat driving on monetary policy."
199,But some Democrat strategists are urging him to drop the decorum.
200,"“Voters at least knew Trump didn’t like it when interest rates went up,” Democratic pollster Evan Roth Smith last week told The New York Times."
201,"“He said something, he berated a guy in public – the guy who raised them – and he drew political distance between himself and that decision by laying blame at the foot of the Fed and Jerome Powell.”
 High borrowing costs – more than the wars in Gaza and Ukraine or migration at the southern U.S. border – could prove Mr. Biden’s undoing."
202,"An early April poll by Mr. Roth Smith’s firm, Blueprint, found that 64 per cent of Americans are worried that Mr. Biden will “allow interest rates to stay high” if he is re-elected."
203,Only 47 per cent said that about Mr. Trump.
204,"The poll of 1,040 registered voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points."
205,"Despite buoyant growth, declining inflation and near-record low unemployment, barely one-third of Americans approve of Mr. Biden’s handling of the economy, according to a CNN poll released on Sunday."
206,"Worse still for Mr. Biden, two-thirds of voters said the economy was “extremely important to their vote for president,” a steep rise from 40 per cent in early 2020."
207,"The poll of 1,212 voters had a margin of error of 3.4 per cent 19 times of 20."
208,"The Fed is expected to hold the line on its benchmark rate, which now stands at 5.3 per cent, after its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, as persistent inflationary pressures push rate cuts further into the future."
209,Mr. Powell has sounded more hawkish in recent weeks amid signs that core inflation remains too far above the Fed’s 2-per-cent target.
210,"With many analysts now predicting the Fed may not lower rates until the end of the year, if at all in 2024, the central bank’s independence is shaping up to become a key election issue as Mr. Trump’s advisers float plans to give the White House a bigger role in setting monetary policy if their candidate is successful in November – and to possibly even fire Mr. Powell."
211,"Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Powell for the top job at the Fed in late 2017, after refusing to name then-Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen to a second term and criticizing the Fed’s moves to nudge interest rates higher on her watch."
212,But Mr. Trump soon began to criticize his own appointee for holding rates too high – until the COVID-19 pandemic drove rates to nearly zero.
213,Mr. Trump has suggested he could fire Mr. Powell before the end of the Fed chair’s term in 2026 if he retakes the White House.
214,The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the presumptive Republican nominee’s advisers have circulated proposals to rein in the Fed’s independence after the election.
215,"Mr. Trump “appears to want someone in charge of the institution who will, in effect, treat the president as an ex officio member of the central bank’s rate-setting committee,” the newspaper reported, adding that the proposals “have alarmed some Trump advisers with more traditional views of the role of the Fed, as well as Republican lawmakers.”
 Any attempt by Mr. Trump to reduce the Fed’s independence would likely face stiff resistance in Congress."
216,"While the president nominates Fed governors, and picks its chair, the Senate must confirm those nominations before they become effective."
217,And even most GOP senators strongly support the principle of Fed independence.
218,"Still, victory in November would likely embolden Mr. Trump to defy political norms even more than he did during his first term."
219,He would likely seek to bend Congress (provided the GOP retakes the Senate and holds the House of Representatives) to his will even more forcibly than he did between 2017 and 2021.
220,"For now, the Fed’s interest-rate orthodoxy is working in Mr. Trump’s favour."
221,"By holding rates higher for longer, the central bank is just doing its job."
222,Inflation remains the biggest threat to the U.S economy and preventing a 1970s-style inflationary spiral must be the Fed’s top priority.
223,"Still, to the extent the Fed’s stand hurts Mr. Biden’s re-election chances, it may be setting itself and the U.S. economy up for a potentially perilous future under Mr. Trump."
224,It must not ignore the unintended consequences of higher rates.
225,"After three straight hotter-than-expected inflation reports, Federal Reserve officials have turned more cautious about the prospect of interest rate cuts this year."
226,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After three straight hotter-than-expected inflation reports, Federal Reserve officials have turned more cautious about the prospect of interest rate cuts this year."
227,"The big question, after they end their latest policy meeting Wednesday, will be: Will they still signal rate cuts at all this year?"
228,"Wall Street traders now envision just a single rate cut this year to the Fed’s benchmark rate, now at a 23-year high of 5.3% after 11 hikes that ended last July."
229,"Traders have sharply downgraded their expectations since 2024 began, when they had expected up to six rate cuts."
230,"As recently as the Fed’s last meeting March 20, the policymakers themselves had projected three rate reductions in 2024."
231,"Rate cuts by the Fed would lead, over time, to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards."
232,Most economists say they still expect two cuts this year.
233,But many acknowledge that one or even no rate reductions are possible.
234,The reason is that elevated inflation is proving more persistent than almost anyone had expected.
235,"According to the Fed’s preferred gauge, inflation reached a 4.4% annual rate in the first three months of this year, up from 1.6% in the final quarter of 2023 and far above the Fed’s 2% target."
236,"At the same time, the economy is healthier and hiring is stronger than most economists thought it would be at this point."
237,"The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for more than two years, the longest such streak since the 1960s."
238,"During the first quarter of the year, consumers spent at a robust pace."
239,"As a result, Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear that they are in no hurry to cut their benchmark rate."
240,"In his most recent remarks two weeks ago, Powell indicated that the pace of price increases had essentially undercut Fed officials’ confidence that inflation was steadily heading back to their target, thereby making rate cuts anytime soon less likely."
241,He also said the Fed would forgo any rate cuts as long as inflation remained elevated.
242,"He stopped short, though, of suggesting that any new rate increases were under consideration."
243,"“If higher inflation does persist,” the Fed chair said, “we can maintain the current level of (interest rates) for as long as needed.”
 Most economists expect Powell to reinforce that message during the news conference he will hold after the Fed’s meeting ends Wednesday."
244,But he could go still further.
245,"During his last news conference in March, for example, Powell said the Fed’s rate was “likely at its peak” and that, “if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate” to start cutting rates this year."
246,"If Powell avoids repeating that sentiment this time, it could suggest that the Fed is less likely to reduce its benchmark rate this year."
247,"“If that (message) is dropped, I think it would be a much stronger signal that we have to hold rates higher for longer,” said Jonathan Pingle, chief economist at UBS."
248,"Though economic growth reached just a 1.6% annual pace in the first three months of this year, a slowdown from the previous quarter, consumer spending grew at a robust pace, a sign that the economy will keep expanding."
249,That persistent strength has caused some Fed officials to speculate that the current level of interest rates may not be high enough to have the cooling effect on the economy and inflation that they need.
250,"If so, the Fed could even have to switch back to rate increases at some point."
251,"“I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase (rates) further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,” Michelle Bowman, a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, said in early April."
252,"On Wednesday, the Fed may also announce that it’s slowing the pace at which it unwinds one of its biggest COVID-era policies: Its purchase of several trillion dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds, an effort to stabilize financial markets and keep longer-term interest rates low."
253,"The Fed is now allowing $95 billion of those securities to mature each month, without replacing them."
254,"Its holdings have fallen to about $7.4 trillion, down from $8.9 trillion in June 2022 when it began reducing them."
255,"By cutting back its holdings, the Fed could contribute to keeping longer-term rates, including mortgage-rates, higher than they would be otherwise."
256,"That’s because as it reduces its bond holdings, other buyers will have to buy the securities instead, and rates might have to rise to attract the needed buyers."
257,"During its meeting in March, Fed official agreed to reduce the pace of its runoff to about $65 billion a month, according to the meeting minutes."
258,"The Fed last reduced its balance sheet in 2019, and while doing so it inadvertently disrupted financial markets and caused short-term interest rates to spike that September."
259,Its goal in slowing the pace at which it reduces its bond ownership is to avoid a similar market disruption by moving more methodically.
