Euro zone government bond yields drifted higher on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, after U.S. employment data tempered expectations for the central bank to signal it may not raise interest rates as quickly.
Italy's 10-year government bond yield also held steady at 4.292%, leaving the premium to German 10-year debt yields at 215 bps.
Euro zone government bond yields drifted higher on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, after U.S. employment data tempered expectations for the central bank to signal it may not raise interest rates as quickly. U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in September, suggesting demand for labour remained strong, while a separate measure of private-sector employment showed more expansion in October than economists had previously forecast.
Investors widely expect the Fed to raise rates by another 75 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00%. Money markets show U.S. rates are likely to peak in the first half of 2023 at 4.75-5.00%. The European Central Bank (ECB), meanwhile, just raised rates to 1.5% and is expected to finish its tightening cycle in just under a year, when rates could reach 2.8%. "We expect the 10-year Bund yield to be at 2.25-2.5% by the end of the year," said Rohan Khanna, research strategist at UBS.
"We see the euro area's inflation at around 10% in the next two or three months, which means that the ECB will find it hard to signal a slowdown in its monetary tightening path," he added. The U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will issue a statement at 1800 GMT, and Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference half an hour later.
Yields on the German benchmark Bund yield were virtually unchanged on the day at 2.13%, as were those on the two-year Schatz, which held at 1.969%. On the supply front, the German central bank topped up a 10-year "green" Bund for an average yield of 2.07%, up from a previous yield of 1.05% and just managed to attract enough bids to cover the auction.
Green debt has struggled this year, as soaring energy prices have knocked climate-friendly investing further down asset managers' agendas, in some cases, and rising interest rates have generally weighed heavily on fixed income. "That big charge into ESG-type debt has been one of the graveyard trades for this year. A lot of green debt has performed very badly," ADM Investor Services chief global economist Marc Ostwald said.
Euro area data on Wednesday painted a bleak picture, after manufacturing activity contracted more sharply than initially estimated in October and pointed to a sector in recession. Italy's 10-year government bond yield also held steady at 4.292%, leaving the premium to German 10-year debt yields at 215 bps.

Stocks fell Monday after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates and Chairman Jerome Powell suggested they would go higher than expected, blowing a hole in hopes for a more dovish pivot in its fight against inflation.

The PSE index, the 30-company benchmark of the Philippine Stock Exchange, lost 50 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 6,156.11 as four of the six subsectors declined.
The broader all-share index also gave back 19 points, or 0.6 percent, to settle at 3,257.83, on a value turnover of P4.5 billion. Losers outnumbered gainers, 114 to 61, while 37 issues were unchanged.
Four of the 10 most active stocks ended in the green, led by International Container Terminal Services Inc. which climbed 5.8 percent to P172.00 and Semirara Mining and Power Corp. which rose 4.3 percent to P35.35.
The peso also depreciated to 58.80 against the US dollar Thursday, from Wednesday’s 58.47 following the Fed’s announcement. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said it would match the Fed’s 75-basis-point adjustment in its own overnight borrowing rate.

Asian and European markets also sank Thursday. Equities have rallied for more than a week on speculation the US central bank would join others in tamping down its monetary-tightening campaign as the economy showed signs of slowing.
The Fed bank unveiled a fourth straight 75 basis-point increase—the sixth hike this year—and opened the door to a smaller increase at future meetings, giving a boost to Wall Street.
But Powell soon after sent traders scattering when he told a news conference that while it would be appropriate to lessen the size of the hikes, “incoming data since our last meeting suggests that ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected”.
He added that “we still have some ways” until borrowing costs were at the necessary level and that it “is very premature to be thinking about pausing”.
And while there is a building fear that the increasingly tight monetary conditions will send the world’s top economy into a recession, the Fed boss said it would take time for the effects of the measures to kick in.
“The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he warned. “We will stay the course, until the job is done.”
Investors now expect rates to top out at more than five percent, compared with four percent currently.
The comments hammered the narrative that had supported stocks, sending Wall Street’s three main indexes tanking – led by rate-sensitive tech giants—and pushing the dollar up against its peers.
“Every time the market gets a little bit of dovish hope, it gets smacked on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper,” Scott Rundell of Mutual Ltd said. “There’s a lot of volatility still ahead.”
Hong Kong led the losses as the city’s central bank hiked rates in line with the Fed, owing to their policy link via the dollar peg.
Traders gave back a chunk of the previous two days’ gains, which came on the back of speculation China was planning to roll back some of its painful zero-Covid policies. Adding to the selling was confirmation from Beijing’s health authority that it intended to stick to the strategy.

Nov. 2 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve, in an effort to end persistent U.S. inflation, is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday by another 0.75 percentage points, or 75 basis points. "Interest rates have risen at a whiplash-inducing speed, and we're not done yet," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. "It's going to take some time for inflation to come down from these lofty levels, even once we do start to see some improvement." Advertisement
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will attend a press briefing Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. EDT to discuss the rate hikes and continuing efforts to lower inflation. Wednesday's expected hike would be the fourth consecutive 75-basis-point hike this year and would bring the federal funds rate to the range of 3.74% to 4%, up from zero to 0.25% in March.
Markets are bracing for the rate hike, and according to CNBC, the Fed is expected to signal that it could begin decreasing the size of the interest rate increases in December and end them at 5% in March.
The most recent interest rate hike by the Fed was in September. Powell said then that the central bank was resolved to restore price stability, which is "the bedrock of our economy."

A Bureau of Economic Analysis report released last week showed inflation continuing at a high rate in September, with the personal consumption expenditures index rising 6.2% from a year ago.
"The market is very fixated on the fact there's going to be 75 [basis points] in November, 50 in December, 25 on Feb. 1 and then probably another 25 in March," said Julian Emanuel, head of equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI. "So in reality, the market already thinks this is happening, and from my point of view, there's no way the outcome of his press conference is going to be more dovish than that."
U.S. stocks opened lower Wednesday in anticipation of the Fed interest rate hike announcement.
Newly constructed home sales plunged by 10.9% in September in response to the rising mortgage rates and were down 17.6% compared to a year ago.


NEW YORK (AP) — Mortgage rates continue to jump, home sales slump and credit cards and auto loans increase. Savings rates are slightly juicier, though. As the Federal Reserve steadily increases interest rates , many economists say they fear that a recession remains inevitable in the coming months — and with it, job losses that could cause hardship for households already hurt worst by inflation .

NEW YORK (AP) — Mortgage rates continue to jump, home sales slump and credit cards and auto loans increase. Savings rates are slightly juicier, though.
As the Federal Reserve steadily increases interest rates , many economists say they fear that a recession remains inevitable in the coming months — and with it, job losses that could cause hardship for households already hurt worst by inflation .
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for a fourth straight time, even as its previous rate increases are being felt by households at all income levels . This would be the sixth rate raise in a row, total.
The Fed’s latest move would raise its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%, the highest level in 14 years. Its steady rate increases have already made it increasingly costly for consumers and businesses to borrow — for homes, autos and other purchases. And more hikes are almost surely coming. Fed officials are expected to signal Wednesday that their benchmark rate could reach as high as 4.6% by early next year.

Here’s what to know:
HOW DOES RAISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE INFLATION?
If one definition of inflation is “too much money chasing too few goods,” then by making it more expensive to borrow money, the Fed hopes to reduce the amount of money in circulation, eventually lowering prices.
WHICH CONSUMERS ARE MOST AFFECTED?
Anyone borrowing money to make a large purchase, such as a home, car, or large appliance, will take a hit, according to Scott Hoyt, an analyst with Moody’s Analytics.
“The new rate pretty dramatically increases your monthly payments and your cost,” he said. “It also affects consumers who have a lot of credit card debt — that will hit right away.”
That said, Hoyt noted that household debt payments, as a proportion of income, remain relatively low, though they have risen lately. So even as borrowing rates steadily rise, many households might not feel a much heavier debt burden immediately.
“I’m not sure interest rates are top of mind for most consumers right now,” Hoyt said. “They seem more worried about groceries and what’s going on at the gas pump . Rates can be something tricky for consumers to wrap their minds around.”

HOW WILL THIS AFFECT CREDIT CARD RATES?
Even before the Fed’s latest decision, credit card borrowing rates have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com, and these will likely continue to rise.
And with inflation raging, there are signs that Americans are increasingly relying on credit cards to help maintain their spending. Total credit card balances have topped $900 billion, according to the Federal Reserve, a record high, though that amount isn’t adjusted for inflation.
John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult, a survey research firm, said its polling suggests that more Americans are spending down the savings they accumulated during the pandemic and are using credit instead. Eventually, rising rates could make it harder for those households to pay off their debts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Those who don’t qualify for low-rate credit cards because of weak credit scores are already paying significantly higher interest on their balances, and they’ll continue to.
As rates have risen, zero percent loans marketed as “Buy Now, Pay Later” have also become popular with consumers. Yet longer-term loans of more than four payments that these companies offer are subject to the same increased borrowing rates as credit cards.
For people who have home equity lines of credit or other variable-interest debt, rates will increase by roughly the same amount as the Fed hike, usually within one or two billing cycles. That’s because those rates are based in part on banks’ prime rate, which follows the Fed’s.
WHAT IF I WANT TO BUY A CAR?
Since the Federal Reserve began increasing rates in March, the average new vehicle loan has gone up nearly 2 percentage points, from 4.5% to 6.3% in October, according to the Edmunds.com auto site. Used vehicle loans are up 1.5% to 9.6%. For both new and used, loan lengths have gotten slightly longer to just over 70 months on average.
ADVERTISEMENT
Key, though, is the monthly payment, on which most people base their automobile purchases. Edmunds says that since March it’s up $46 to $703 for new vehicles. The payment is up $21 per month for used vehicles to $564.
Edmunds Director of Insights Ivan Drury says the increased payments probably won’t make much of a difference in buying habits, but they’re hitting totals that could stop people from buying. “Now that we’re past $700 per month (on new vehicles) people will drop out of the market,” he said.
HOW ARE SAVERS AFFECTED?
The rising returns on high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have put them at levels not seen since 2009, which means households may want to boost savings wherever possible. You can also now earn more on bonds and other fixed-income investments.
Though savings, CDs, and money market accounts don’t typically track the Fed’s changes, online banks and others that offer high-yield savings accounts can be exceptions. These institutions typically compete aggressively for depositors. (The catch: They sometimes require significantly high deposits.)
ADVERTISEMENT
In general, banks tend to capitalize on a higher-rate environment to boost their profits by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering juicer rates to savers.
WILL THIS AFFECT RENTS? HOME OWNERSHIP?
Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 7% , its highest point in 14 years, meaning that rates on home loans are about twice as expensive as they were a year ago.
Mortgage rates don’t always move perfectly in tandem with the Fed increase, instead tracking the expected yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has reached 4%, its highest level since 2011.
Sales of existing homes have declined for eight straight months as borrowing costs have become too high a hurdle for many Americans already paying more for food, gas and other necessities.
WILL IT BE EASIER TO FIND A HOUSE IF I’M STILL LOOKING TO BUY?
If you’re financially able to proceed with a home purchase, you’re likely to have more options than at any time in the past year.
HOW HAVE THE RATE HIKES INFLUENCED CRYPTO?
Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have dropped in value since the Fed began raising rates. So have many previously high-valued technology stocks. Bitcoin has plunged from a peak of about $68,000 to under $20,000.
Higher rates mean that safe assets like Treasuries have become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased. That makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive, in turn.
Still, bitcoin continues to suffer from problems separate from economic policy. Two major crypto firms have failed, shaking the confidence of crypto investors.
WHAT’S PROMPTING THE RATE INCREASES?
The short answer: Inflation. Over the past year, inflation has clocked in at a painful 8.2%. So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, also rose faster than expected.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned last month that, “our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional” — a remark widely interpreted to mean the Fed will fight inflation with rate increases even if it leads to deep job losses or a recession.
The goal is to slow consumer spending, thereby reducing demand for homes, cars and other goods and services, eventually cooling the economy and lowering prices.
Powell has acknowledged that aggressively raising interest rates would “bring some pain.”
WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?
Some economists argue that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. One argument is that a tight labor market is fueling wage growth and higher inflation. In August, the economy gained 315,000 jobs. There are roughly two job openings advertised for every unemployed worker.
“Job openings continue to exceed job hires, indicating employers are still struggling to fill vacancies,” said Odeta Kushi, an economist with First American.
WILL THIS AFFECT STUDENT LOANS?
Borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more as as rates increase. The current range for federal loans is between about 5% and 7.5%.
That said, payments on federal student loans are suspended with zero interest until Dec. 31 as part of an emergency measure put in place early in the pandemic. President Joe Biden has also announced some loan forgiveness, of up to $10,000 for most borrowers, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients.
IS THERE A CHANCE THE RATE HIKES WILL BE REVERSED?
Stock prices rose in August based on hopes that the Fed would reverse course. But it looks increasingly unlikely that rates will come down anytime soon. Economists expect Fed officials to signal additional increases in 2023, possibly to nearly 5%.
WILL THERE BE A RECESSION?
Short-term rates at these levels will make a recession likelier by increasing the cost of mortgages, car loans, and business loans. While the Fed hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow growth by cooling the hot job market and capping wage growth, the risk is that the Fed could weaken the economy, causing a recession that would produce significant job losses.

US private payrolls increased more than expected in October, offering more evidence of labor market resilience and suggesting that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while.
US private payrolls increased more than expected in October, offering more evidence of labor market resilience and suggesting that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while.
The pick-up in private hiring shown in the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday was concentrated in the services sector, specifically the leisure and hospitality industry. But rapidly rising borrowing costs appeared to weigh on hiring in the goods-producing sector, with factories shedding jobs.
The report followed on the heels of government data on Tuesday showing an unexpected jump in job openings in September.
“A tight labor market and rising wages will complicate things for the Fed and the risk is the labor market could remain tight for quite some time,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. Private employment increased by 239,000 jobs last month. Data for September was revised down to show 192,000 jobs created instead of 208,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 195,000 private jobs.
The services sector added 247,000 jobs, with the leisure and hospitality industry accounting for 210,000 positions. Payrolls in the trade, transportation and utilities industry increased by 84,000 jobs.
But employment decreased in information, financial activities, professional business services as well as education and healthcare industries.
The goods providing sector shed 8,000 jobs as manufacturing lost 20,000 positions. But natural resources and mining added 11,000 jobs while construction payrolls rose by 1,000 positions.
“While we’re seeing early signs of Fed-driven demand destruction, it’s affecting only certain sectors of the labor market,” said Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist.
The report also showed wages for job stayers increased 7.7% in October, in line with recent months. Wage increases for job changers dipped 15.2% from 15.7% in September.
Solid job growth
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for October on Friday. Following recent changes, the jury is still out on whether it offers a reliable signal on the BLS data.
“The figures from recent months have not given us the sense that the ADP report will prove to be a reliable signal about the BLS data in real time,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “Keeping all of that in mind, the October ADP report looks fairly consistent with expectations for Friday’s BLS report, with its headline pointing to October being another strong month for job growth.”
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely rose by 200,000 jobs last month after rising by 288,000 in September. With no job gains expected in the government sector, overall nonfarm payrolls are also forecast to have increased by 200,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September.
Though the Fed’s stiff rate hikes are cooling demand, employers continue to seek workers. There were 10.7 million job openings at the end of September, with roughly 1.9 openings for every unemployed person.


Global stock indexes fell and the dollar was slightly lower against other major currencies on Wednesday ahead of what is expected to be another aggressive interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the day.
Global stock indexes fell and the dollar was slightly lower against other major currencies on Wednesday ahead of what is expected to be another aggressive interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve later in the day. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed.
The U.S. central bank is expected to announce a fourth three-quarters of a percentage point increase, part of its effort to bring down inflation. The policy statement from the bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in March to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%.
The key question for some market participants is whether the Fed will also signal it could slow additional rate hikes, in a so-called dovish pivot. Analysts said uncertainty over how economic data would pan out meant a dovish pivot could still be some way off.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October. It followed a report on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, also supporting the case for the Fed to remain hawkish. "The typical calm before the FOMC storm is what we're seeing this morning, across all asset classes really," said Michael Brown, head of market intelligence at payments firm Caxton in London. In currencies, the euro was 0.11% higher against the dollar at $0.9885, while against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell 0.8% to 147.03 yen.
A Reuters poll found currency strategists thought the dollar's retreat was temporary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 93.27 points, or 0.29%, to 32,559.93, the S&P 500 lost 17.14 points, or 0.44%, to 3,838.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 71.06 points, or 0.65%, to 10,819.79.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.10% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.21%. Treasury yields were little changed in the hours before the Fed news.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was above 4%, while two-year yields, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was above 4.5%. U.S. crude recently rose 0.44% to $88.76 per barrel and Brent was at $95.03, up 0.4% on the day.
Earlier, upbeat remarks by Chinese regulators about policy support and rising expectations among investors about easing of strict COVID-19 measures boosted sentiment in its market. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday a tweak to the central bank's yield curve control policy, which has contributed to the weakness in the yen, could become a future option.

To see what names may rally if the Federal Reserve indicates a potential step down in hikes, CNBC Pro looked at the biggest gainers from July's Fed day.
Based on a hint we got earlier this year, there are certain names that could rally if the Federal Reserve indicates Wednesday it may slow the pace of tightening. The central bank is expected to hike interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday in an effort to tame inflation. It's what Chair Jerome Powell indicates about future rate hikes that the market will be watching. Investors have been hoping for a pivot by the Fed and will be looking to see if Powell indicates a step down in the pace of rate increases going forward. The last time investors thought the central bank would slow things down was on July 27, when Powell left the door open about the size of the Fed's move in September. The market rallied that day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping more than 400 points and the S & P 500 gaining 2.62%. "As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation," Powell said at the time. It turned out the Fed didn't slow the pace of increases and instead hiked rates another 75 basis points in September. But that day gave us a window into investors' thinking. To see what names may rally on Wednesday if the Fed indicates a potential step down, CNBC Pro looked at the biggest gainers that July day. Here are the biggest gainers on July 27, not including those that moved higher on specific company news. They include names in technology, consumer services, consumer cyclicals and industrials. They are also risky, high-beta names that would benefit if the central bank doesn't push the economy into a recession.


Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday after data showed private payrolls rose more than expected in October, adding to worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not have enough reason to tone down its aggressive rate hike policy.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday after data showed private payrolls rose more than expected in October, adding to worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not have enough reason to tone down its aggressive rate hike policy.
With markets already expecting another 75-basis point rate hike later in the day, investors are keenly waiting for any hints from the central bank on smaller increases in December.
However, U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, the ADP National Employment report showed, offering further evidence that the Fed's rapid rate hikes have yet to significantly slow economic growth.
The report showed private payrolls rose by 239,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 195,000 jobs.
It follows a survey on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, which pointed to strong labor demand and doused hopes of a change in the central bank's aggressive policy approach, which helped drive a strong rally for stocks in October.
Still, traders are split on the odds of a 50 bps or 75 bps rate hike in December, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.
The Fed's interest rate decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but focus will be on commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later.
"The Fed has said they're going to be data dependent and that is not good because the inflation numbers are still high and unemployment is low," said Fall Ainina, director of research at James Investments.
"The numbers are still not there for the Fed to really pivot."
The non-farm payrolls report due on Friday will offer further clues on the outlook for interest rates.

Asian share markets slid on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve laid the groundwork for a protracted tightening campaign that torpedoed market hopes for a pause, sank bonds and lifted the dollar.
Summary https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4
S&P 500 futures down 0.3%, Nikkei futures slip
Fed's Powell says nowhere nearing pausing on hikes
Dollar rebounds with Treasury yields
SYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Asian share markets slid on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve laid the groundwork for a protracted tightening campaign that torpedoed market hopes for a pause, sank bonds and lifted the dollar.
Investors were initially cheered that the Fed opened the door to a slowdown in the pace of hikes after raising interest rates 75 basis points to 3.75-4.0%, by noting that policy acted with a lag.
But Chair Jerome Powell soured the mood by saying it was "very premature" to think about pausing and that the peak for rates would likely be higher than previously expected.
"The Fed is now more comfortable with taking smaller rate increases for a longer period than delivering larger increases now," said Brian Daingerfield, an analyst at NatWest Markets.
"The tightening cycle is officially now a marathon, not a sprint."
Futures were now split on whether the Fed would move by 50 or 75 basis points in December, and nudged up the top for rates to 5.0-5.25% likely by May next year. They also imply little chance of a rate cut until December 2023.
"Higher for longer" was not what the equity markets wanted to hear and Wall Street fell sharply after Powell's comments. Early Thursday, S&P 500 futures were off another 0.3%, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.2%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) shed 0.9%, with South Korea (.KS11) down 1.5%.
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) was closed for a holiday, but futures were trading around 350 points below Wednesday's cash close.
Two-year Treasury yields popped up to 4.63% as the curve bear flattened, with the spread to 10-year notes near its most inverted since the turn of the century.
Attention now turns to the U.S. ISM survey of services later Thursday and Friday's payrolls report where any upside surprise will likely reinforce the Fed's hawkish outlook.
BoE TAKES THE STAGE
Also taking centre stage will be the Bank of England where the market is fully priced for a rate hike of 75 basis points to its highest since late 2008 at 3.0%.
"There will be interest in the BoE's new CPI and GDP forecasts, with the latter likely to show a deeper and more protracted recession in 2023 and 2024," said Ray Attrill head of FX strategy at NAB.
A gloomy outlook could put more pressure on the pound, which was pinned at $1.1374 after retreating from a top of $1.1564 overnight.
The U.S. dollar was broadly bid on Powell's hawkish take, leaving the dollar index at 112.190 after an overnight bounce from a 110.400 low.
The euro was flat at $0.9810 , having toppled from a high of $0.9976 overnight, while the dollar climbed to 147.87 yen from a trough of 145.68.
The bounce in the dollar and yields was a drag for gold, which was stuck at $1,633 an ounce after being as high as $1,669 at one stage overnight.
Oil prices also disliked the dollar rally with Brent down 88 cents at $95.28 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell $1.02 to $88.98.
In good news for bread lovers, wheat futures plummeted overnight after Russia said it would resume its participation in a deal to export grain from war-torn Ukraine.

The International Monetary Fund may need to raise its forecast for U.S. growth after stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP data, a senior IMF official said on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve rate hikes are starting to cool demand, especially in housing.
WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund may need to raise its forecast for U.S. growth after stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP data, a senior IMF official said on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve rate hikes are starting to cool demand, especially in housing.
Nigel Chalk, acting director of the Fund's Western Hemisphere department, told Reuters in an interview that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts for 1.6% U.S. real GDP growth in 2022 had assumed a lower third-quarter print than the 2.6% annual growth rate reported last week by the Commerce Department.
"It was a strong report. It was definitely a stronger quarter than we had in our forecast in the October WEO so leading from that sense, there's upside," Chalk said.
But he said that U.S. GDP has been extremely volatile this year, coming off a 0.6% contraction in the second quarter, with the third-quarter data powered by an unusually large contribution from net exports coupled with a major buildup of inventories.
The IMF in its Oct. 11 World Economic Outlook had cut its U.S. growth forecast by 0.7 percentage point, based on the weak Q2 output earlier in the year. Along with other factors, such as rising food and energy costs prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy, the U.S. reduction offset upside surprises in Europe, leaving the IMF's 2022 global growth forecast unchanged at 3.2%.
But Chalk said the third-quarter data reflected a shift in American consumption patterns that could cause negative spillovers to other countries, namely a shift back to spending on services, including travel, restaurants and healthcare, and away from pandemic-induced demand for imported goods.
"I think this re-composition of demand in the U.S. is a really important feature. Going forward into next year, the U.S. is slowing and that's never good for the global economy," Chalk said. "In addition to slowing, it's shifting away from goods, and that's sort of exacerbating that effect on the global economy."
U.S. services demand is largely confined within U.S. borders, but demand for imports is falling, he said, adding, "when U.S. goods demand is declining, that's bad for the rest of the world."
The IMF has forecast that U.S. growth will decline further to 1.0% in 2023, with global growth falling to 2.7% next year.
But the Fund has also said given the uncertainties over the Ukraine war, energy prices, inflation and China's property sector there was a 25% chance of growth falling below 2% - a phenomenon that has occurred only five times since 1970 - and a more than 10% chance of a global GDP contraction.
Chalk said that the U.S. housing market was already slowing markedly due to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and the higher rates would likely start to have a bigger effect on U.S. labor markets, wages and inflation in 2023.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street ahead of what traders expect will be another big interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street ahead of what traders expect will be another big interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday that’s expected to produce the sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. The S&P 500 was off 0.4%, as was the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
U.S. futures trading on Wall Street appeared to be in a holding pattern ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase in its attempt to curb inflation.
Futures for the Dow Jones industrials were unchanged and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1%..
The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. It would be the fourth .75 percentage point increase this year.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth while trying not to ignite a recession.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the central bank's fight against inflation would likely come with “some pain." Powell and his colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs is steadily declining.
In September, America’s employers slowed their hiring but still added 263,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, matching a half-century low. The October jobs report comes this Friday.
In Europe at midday, France's CAC 40 lost 0.2%, Britain's FTSE lost 0.3% and Germany's DAX was essentially flat.
Chinese shares extended gains, driven by speculation Beijing might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade.
“The power of social media and retail investors was evident after stories circled on China’s zero COVID policy and if Beijing is preparing to phase it out," Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.
“Despite new lockdowns being announced ... a China reopening is the biggest ticket in town, and it’s better to show up early rather than late to the reopening party," he said.
B ullish talk by Chinese regulators who addressed a conference of global financiers in Hong Kong also lifted sentiment.
Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending the meeting to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong. He was among several senior Chinese officials who, speaking in prerecorded video addresses, downplayed risks to the economy due partly to a slump in the real estate sector.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 15,827.17, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.2% to 3,003.37.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed, declining less than 0.1% to finish at 27,663.39. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.1% to 6,986.70. South Korea’s Kospi added nearly 0.1% to 2,336.87.
South Korea’s export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. Consumer price inflation rose 5.7% on year in October, in line with the market consensus.
“Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after their stellar performance yesterday,” Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said in a report.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 18 cents to $88.55 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 24 cents to $94.89 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 147.05 Japanese yen from 148.23 yen. The euro cost 99 cents, up from 98.78 cents.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9%, while the Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.

The ADP report offers more evidence of labour market resilience and suggests that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while
U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, offering more evidence of labour market resilience and suggesting that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while.
Private employment increased by 239,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment report showed on Wednesday. Data for September was revised down to show 192,000 jobs created instead of 208,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 195,000 private jobs.
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for October on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely rose by 200,000 jobs last month after rising by 288,000. With no job gains expected in the government sector, overall nonfarm payrolls are also forecast to have increased by 200,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September.
Though the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes are cooling demand, employers continue to seek workers.
The government reported on Tuesday that there were 10.7 million job openings at the end of September, with roughly 1.9 openings for every unemployed person.
The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver a fourth three-quarters of a percentage point interest rate hike on Wednesday as it fights to bring inflation down to its 2 per cent target. The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in March to the current range of 3.00 per cent to 3.25 per cent, the swiftest pace of policy tightening in a generation or more.


U.S. stock futures drop Wednesday ahead of what's expected to be the Federal Reserve's fourth straight meeting of an interest rate hike of 75 basis points.
What I am looking Wednesday, at Nov. 2, 2022 U.S. stock futures drop Wednesday ahead of what's expected to be the Federal Reserve's fourth straight meeting of an interest rate hike of 75 basis points.

What I am looking Wednesday, at Nov. 2, 2022


As it battles inflation that remains at four-decade highs, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike its key interest rate another 0.75% Wednesday.
As it battles inflation that remains at four-decade highs, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike its key interest rate another 0.75% Wednesday.
The Federal Open Market Committee met Tuesday to set the latest rate increase; it is expected to be announced Wednesday afternoon. This interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, affects the cost of borrowing and the pace of investment throughout the economy. Since March, the Fed's rate-hiking has helped make borrowing and investing more expensive, the purpose of which is intended to slow the economy and moderate price increases.
The rate hikes this year have unfolded against the backdrop of a consumer price index that has remained elevated. In September, it clocked in at 8.2% on an annual basis. Food and energy price increases were higher. Even stripped of those two items, whose price swings tend to be more volatile, the index saw its largest increase since 1982.
The rate hike would be the sixth consecutive one this year for the Fed, a cycle not seen since the inflation-fighting days of the early 1980s. The central bank has been bedeviled by stubbornly high inflation readings even as other factors that had been influencing price increases, like higher gas and energy prices, have cooled off.
As a result, some experts believe the Fed must keep raising interest rates, even if it drives unemployment higher. The Fed's dual mandate dictates it must balance inflation and employment. Writing in The Washington Post this week, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to maintain an aggressive stance on rate hikes, even if it causes job losses in the short term.
Summers predicted unemployment would have to rise above 4.4% to get inflation under control. The U.S. unemployment rate currently stands at 3.5%.
"For more than a decade, from 1966 to 1979, policymakers failed to do what was necessary to contain inflation because they shrank from the immediate consequences of restrictive policy," Summers wrote. "History remembers them poorly."
But debate has been ongoing concerning whether the Fed's posture is now too aggressive, given other signs of weakening in the economy. That includes the fastest deceleration in home price growth on record as mortgage rates soar to more than 7% — the highest in 20 years.
Other interest rates, like those for auto loans and credit cards, are at highs not seen in more than a decade, meaning higher car payments and higher interest fees if you're carrying a balance on your credit card. Another measure of inflation, personal consumption expenditures, has slowed over the past three months, when excluding volatile food and energy prices.
"We doubt Chair Powell’s tone will change significantly this week, but he won’t be able to hold back the tide if the numbers turn," Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients Monday.
He said market observers will be keenly focused on Friday's payrolls report, which will show whether average hourly earnings are still growing. Wages have been increasing alongside inflation, though not enough to keep up with the price increases. The average hourly wage in the U.S. is now $32.46 as of September, up from $28.09 in September 2019. While workers may be enjoying higher salaries, the extra money gets eaten up by higher prices paid for goods and services.
"The Fed will not pause — never mind consider easing — as long as wage growth remains much faster than is consistent with the inflation target," Shepherdson wrote.
Other economic experts say inflation is steering the ship.
"Despite a rapidly cooling housing market, inflation has shown no signs of letting up, the labor market is still strong, and the economy is resilient," Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with Bankrate, said in a statement. "This forces the Fed to continue its aggressive approach on interest rates."


Powell is likely to be asked whether the Fed will slow rate hikes designed to fight inflation in the coming months.
With another three-quarter-point hike expected for the Fed's key short-term rate, watchers are looking for hints on the future.
WASHINGTON — Looming over the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday is a question of intense interest: Just how high will the Fed's inflation-fighters raise interest rates — and might they slow their rate hikes as soon as next month?
The Fed on Wednesday is expected to announce a hefty three-quarter-point hike in its key short-term rate — its fourth straight — which will lead to still-higher loan rates for many businesses and consumers. What many Fed-watchers hope is that Chair Jerome Powell will hint at a news conference that the central bank may ease the pace of its hikes, perhaps to a half-point in December and two quarter-point hikes next year.
Even at that more moderate pace, the central bank's benchmark rate would reach 4.75% to 5%, which would be its highest range since 2007, up from the current 3% to 3.25%. Fed officials have stressed that they need to sharply raise rates to tame inflation, which reached 8.2% in September from 12 months earlier, barely below a 40-year high. Chronic inflation has also become a central point of attack for Republicans against Democrats in the midterm congressional elections.
So far this year, the Fed has raised its key rate five times in an aggressive pace that has sent borrowing rates surging across the economy and heightened the risk of a recession. The home market, in particular, has been badly bruised as a consequence. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, surpassed 7% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months.
One reason the Fed's policymakers might feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.
Still, the job market remains consistently strong, which could make it harder for the Fed to cool the economy and curb inflation. On Tuesday, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply.
A ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers. Those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices, thereby fueling more inflation.
If Powell does signal Wednesday that the Fed may lift its foot slightly off the economic brakes, it could spark a rally in stock and bond prices. Such higher asset prices, though, might then fuel more spending just when the Fed wants to cool things down to throttle inflation.
To offset any potential burst of optimism, the Fed may signal at its next meeting in December that it expects to add at least another rate hike early next year. That would serve to make borrowing even more expensive and would further heighten the risk of a recession.
Ultimately, economists at Goldman Sachs expect the Fed's policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5% by March. That is above what the Fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in September.
For now, many Fed officials have said they see few signs that inflation is easing in any sustainable way. They point, in particular, to so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures.

Investors will be looking to see whether the central bank plans to take a "step down" from its monetary policy path.
As markets look for signs that the Federal Reserve is stepping away from its breakneck pace of interest rate hikes, two words from this week's meeting could be crucial. Investors will be looking to see whether the central bank plans to take a "step down" from its monetary policy path, an expression used recently by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and adopted multiple times in Wall Street market and economic commentary. No one is expecting the Fed to stop rate hikes, at least for several months. But news that this week could be the end of a string of three-quarter point increases at least would provide some balm for weary financial markets. Investors have been hoping for a Fed "pivot" on policy, but likely will take anything they can get at this point, even if it just means a nod to a potential half-point hike in December. "While it is hard to call hikes of 75 [basis points] and 50 [basis points] a 'pivot,' we think some may try to claim victory, but even here there is difficulty," Walls Fargo economists wrote in a recent client note. "For this to occur, the Fed would need to signal a near-term 'step-down.'" A basis point is one one-hundredth of one percentage point. Thus far this year, the Fed has r aised its benchmark short-term borrowing rate 3 percentage points, or 300 basis points. Uncertainty ahead Markets have almost completely priced in the 75 basis point move for November, but are split on December between 50 and 75, according to CME Group data. The expectation from there is for a pronounced slowdown, so Wall Street will be watching carefully Wednesday for language in the post-Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement, as well as Chairman Jerome Powell 's news conference thereafter. "We expect the FOMC to deliver a fourth 75bp rate hike at its November meeting, and indicate that it could soon be appropriate to step down the pace of hikes," Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner wrote. "We continue to expect the Fed to step down to 50bp in December and 25bp in January, reaching a peak rate of 4.625%." What the "step down" language will mean, however, is unclear. Federal Reserve officials are watching the economic data closely, and some of it is not cooperating with the central bank's quest to return inflation to 2%. Consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures releases show inflation still near 40-year highs. The labor market remains extraordinarily tight, evidenced by a release Wednesday showing job openings still outnumber available labor by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Some economists think the Fed will be leery about tipping its hand for future rate moves. If the data continue to show a vibrant labor market and high prices, officials will want the option of continuing down the present path. Even Daly, the San Francisco regional president who talked extensively about the "step-down" concept, said she hasn't changed her views about where rates need to go over the long run, only that she'd like to see the intensity of the increases lessened. "For me, it's really challenging to step down right now when we have inflation printing so high and we have core services inflation rising and we also have the unemployment rate at historical lows," Daly said in a public appearance a few weeks ago. "I make the distinction between when you start talking about it vs. when you start doing it. I think the time is now to start talking about stepping down." Wall Street expects those to be baby steps down. "We expect the Fed to remain data dependent and emphasize cumulative policy rate tightening over any step down in pace," Bank of America said in a client note. "The November FOMC meeting is not about the November policy rate decision. Instead, the meeting is about future policy rate guidance and what to expect in December and beyond." The bank's experts said it expects Powell to be cautious. Possible letdown Markets already have misinterpreted the chair's comments in the past — over the summer, a seemingly innocuous comment from Powell that he expects a day to come when the pace of hikes would diminish set off a feverish rally on Wall Street that was the exact opposite of what the Fed wants as it looks to tighten financial conditions. "We think the Fed will be reluctant to pre-commit to a smaller rate hike this far in advance. Data still need to cooperate," BofA said. "Committee members may also be reluctant to signal a slower pace of hikes lest financial markets interpret the decision as a 'dovish pivot.'" On balance, the bank said, investors may be somewhat disappointed as Powell remains noncommittal as "appropriate policy is now ultimately about the final destination and not the journey." Even with the step-down hopes from Wednesday's meeting, market expectations are still for a fairly aggressive Fed. Futures pricing points to a "terminal rate," or the point where the Fed stops, at just shy of 5%, or 2 percentage points above the current funds rate level. Fed officials have been steadfast that they plan on holding rates higher, even if it means higher unemployment and a slow-growth economy. "I'm not sure how much the Fed is going to tip their hand to show how much they're going to do in December," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. "The market's going to be surprised when the Fed causes a recession and doesn't immediately cut rates."

Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.

(The Hill) — Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).
MBA’s weekly survey shows the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate falling to 7.06 percent, down from 7.16 a week earlier, and applications decreasing for the sixth-straight week. Rates, however, remained near the highest level in two decades.
The share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM’s), which rose recently as mortgage rates surged, declined from the previous week to 11.8 percent of total applications.
Despite the small drop in the 30-year fixed rate, mortgage rates are significantly higher than last year and continue to challenge buyers and the housing market overall.
“Apart from the ARM loan rate, rates for all other loan types were more than three percentage points higher than they were a year ago,” Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist, said in a statement.
“These elevated rates continue to put pressure on both purchase and refinance activity and have added to the ongoing affordability challenges impacting the broader housing market, as seen in the deteriorating trends in housing starts and home sales,” Kan added.
Meanwhile, the share of refinance activity stayed low as homeowners are hesitant to risk losing their low rates.
“With most homeowners locked into significantly lower rates, refinance applications continued to run more than 80 percent below last year’s pace, while the refinance share of applications was 28.6 percent – the fifth straight week below 30 percent,” Kan said.
The drop in mortgage rates follows months of steady increases fueled by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest hikes to curb rising inflation. And experts expect the Fed to increase rates again during the U.S. central bank’s meeting on Wednesday.
Overall, the Fed’s fight with inflation has led to a dramatic cooling of the once red-hot housing market.
Surging rates in recent weeks have led to record home price deceleration and plummeting pending sales. The number of homes under contract fell for the fourth consecutive month in September, declining by 10.2 percent from August, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
And NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects high rates to linger.
“The new normal for mortgage rates could be around 7% for a while,” Yun said in a statement last week.
“On a $300,000 loan, that translates to a typical monthly mortgage payment of nearly $2,000, compared to $1,265 just one year ago – a difference of more than $700 per month. Only when inflation is tamed will mortgage rates retreat and boost home purchasing power for buyers,” Yun said.


Brent crude dipped 56 cents to $94.09 a barrel by 1027 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 53 cents at $87.84
Oil prices slipped on Thursday ahead of an expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve, but found a floor as market participants eyed falling U.S. crude stockpiles and upcoming European sanctions on Russian barrels.
Brent crude dipped 56 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $94.09 a barrel by 1027 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 53 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $87.84 per barrel.
U.S. crude oil stocks fell about 6.5 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 28, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures.
At the same time, gasoline inventories fell 2.6 million barrels, more than expected. Official data is due at 1430 GMT.
China’s zero-COVID policy has been a key factor in keeping a lid on oil prices as repeated lockdowns have slowed growth and pared oil demand in the world’s second-largest economy.
An unverified note on social media said the Chinese government was going to consider ways to relax COVID-19 rules from next March, potentially boosting demand in the world’s No.2 oil user.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell from Tuesday’s highs as investors braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision at 1800 GMT, with many hoping for signs of a slowdown in future rate hikes.
A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The potential disruption from the European Union embargo on Russian oil that is set to start on Dec. 5 may also be pushing prices higher. The ban, a reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will be followed by a halt on oil product imports in February.
“Despite slowing economies and China’s COVID-19 woes, the odds are that the lack of supply will gain the upper hand over demand concerns in the short term. Therefore, expect oil prices to close out this year heading into triple-digit territory,” PVM analyst Stephen Brennock said.


The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday again by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting as the central bank continues to try to tame multi-decade highs in inflation.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday again by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting as the central bank continues to try to tame multi-decade highs in inflation.
Four 75-basis-point rate hikes in a row is unprecedented since the Fed explicitly started targeting the federal funds rate to conduct monetary policy in the late 1980s.
That level of rate hike would bring the central bank’s policy rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.75% to 4% — its highest level since the end of 2007— from a current range between 3% and 3.25%.
Recent comments from Fed officials point to the propensity to slow down the pace of rate hikes if inflation data shows a clear downward trend. Investors will be focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell says in his press conference about how quickly and how high rates could go in the coming months.
"We might find ourselves, and the markets have certainly priced this in, with another 75-basis-point increase," San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at a meeting of the University of California, Berkeley's Fisher Center for Real Estate & Urban Economics' Policy Advisory Board last week. "But I would really recommend people don't take that away and think, well it's 75 forever."
The Fed will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET followed by Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. This post will be updated.
Recent data appear to point to signs that domestic demand is being pushed down by higher interest rates. Final sales to private domestic purchasers — a measure of consumer and business spending used to assess underlying demand in the economy — inched up at a 0.1% annual rate in the third quarter after rising 0.5% in the second quarter and 2.1% in the first quarter.
The job market is also cooling, with job openings falling sharply in August and the job quits rate trending lower while fewer new jobs being minted on a monthly basis. Economists project that Friday's job report will show that 200,000 nonfarm payrolls were created in October, a result that would be down from the 263,000 jobs created in September and down from the monthly average of 420,000 in 2022.

There are also signs below the surface that inflationary pressures are easing. The employment cost index showed private wages and salaries rising by 1.2% in the third quarter, down from 1.6% in the second, pushing the annual growth rate down from 5.7% to 5.2%.

Other measures of inflation aren’t easing as quickly as officials hope. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — the price consumption expenditures index (PCE) excluding volatile food and energy prices — rose by 5.1% in September and 6.2% on a headline basis. That’s down from 7% but still far from the Fed’s 2% inflation target. And the consumer price index — excluding volatile food and energy prices a stickier measure of inflation — rose by 6.6% in September, accelerating from 6.3% in August and 5.9% in July.
“The November FOMC meeting is not about the November policy rate decision,” Bank of America analyst, Michael Gapen, wrote in a research note to clients. “Instead, the meeting is about future policy rate guidance and what to expect in December and beyond.”

The Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again on Wednesday, approving a fourth-straight rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point as part of an aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the US economy.
Washington, D.C. CNN —
The Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again on Wednesday, approving a fourth-straight rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point as part of an aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the US economy.
The supersized hike would bring the central bank’s benchmark lending rate to a new target range of 3.75% to 4%. That’s the highest the fed funds rate has been since January 2008.
Wednesday’s decision, which comes at the end of a two-day policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, would also mark the Fed’s toughest policy move since the 1980s and will likely deepen the economic pain for millions of American businesses and households by pushing up the cost of borrowing even further. There’s also a chance it could trigger a recession.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed that persistent, entrenched inflation would bring greater economic suffering than a recession would, he has also acknowledged the economic hardships that result from tightening monetary policy.
“I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t,” he said in September.
Here’s what to watch for: According to the CME Fedwatch tool, traders believe there’s nearly a 90% chance of a three-quarter-percentage-point rate hike this month. That means investors have already switched their focus to the December meeting, which they expect will be the point at which the central bank starts to dial back its hawkish policy stance.
They will be closely watching Powell’s post-meeting press conference to see if he lays the groundwork for a step down in the pace of rate hikes. “He could do so by acknowledging the slowdown in the real economy already underway and emphasizing the lags between slowing economic activity and weakening price pressures,” wrote Michael Pearce, senior economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Recent data only underscores the “choose your own adventure” aspect of the US economy: Mortgage rates at levels not seen in almost 20 years are beginning to choke the housing market. Sales of newly constructed homes dropped 10.9% in September from August and were down 17.6% from a year ago.
Yet some inflationary pressures are easing. Wages and salaries rose by 1.2% in the third quarter, down from 1.6% in the second, according to the Employment Cost Index.
And through it all, the job market has remained tight. Job openings unexpectedly surged in September, indicating there are 1.9 job openings for every available worker. Friday’s upcoming jobs report is expected to show the economy added another 205,000 positions in October, down from last month but still historically high.
Looking forward: Wednesday’s policy announcement and the press conference that immediately follows will be closely analyzed for any potential forward guidance by the Fed.
“A 75 basis-point hike from the Fed this week is practically a done deal. The much bigger question is around how the Fed signals its future policy path,” wrote Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at abrdn, in a note.
“The challenge for the Fed is to signal a slowdown without letting the market develop a narrative of the Fed ‘pivoting’ away from its current priority of cooling underlying inflation pressures,” he wrote.


U.S. stock futures wobbled Wednesday morning as Wall Street readied for a highly anticipated policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
U.S. stock futures wobbled Wednesday morning as Wall Street readied for a highly anticipated policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise its key short-term interest rate by 0.75% for a fourth straight time after its two-day meeting concludes at 2:00 p.m. ET.
Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were roughly flat, while futures on the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) were off by 0.1%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were up by about the same margin.
Treasury yields advanced along with equities. The benchmark 10-year note held above 4%, while the rate-sensitive two-year yields overed around 4.5%.
Investors will assess remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the aftermath of the rate decision, along with economic projections from policymakers and the latest dot plot showing each member’s forecast for the U.S. short-term interest rate.
"The focus will be on what comes next, and we expect Chair Powell to hint that the Federal Open Market Committee will likely slow the pace to 50 basis points in December," economists at Goldman Sachs led by Jan Hatzius said in a recent note.
Any signal from the central bank on a potential easing in the pace of tightening will serve as a tailwind for the major indexes, which closed last month higher on expectations of a policy pivot stoked by chatter from some officials suggesting a scale back rate increases and global concerns that tightening may trigger financial instability. But some strategists have pushed back against the notion that a shift in the Fed’s path is imminent, with inflation and payrolls still elevated.
“As of now, the inflation and labor market criteria have not been met, so Mr. Powell can’t pre-announce any intention to shift to slower rate increases without contradicting what he said just six weeks ago,” Pantheon Economics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said in emailed comments. “Evidence of fading pressure in the pipeline is abundant, but it is yet to hit the numbers which the Fed Chair has said clearly on multiple occasions matter most, namely, the actual core inflation data.”

Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.

(The Hill) — Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).
MBA’s weekly survey shows the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate falling to 7.06 percent, down from 7.16 a week earlier, and applications decreasing for the sixth-straight week. Rates, however, remained near the highest level in two decades.
The share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM’s), which rose recently as mortgage rates surged, declined from the previous week to 11.8 percent of total applications.
Despite the small drop in the 30-year fixed rate, mortgage rates are significantly higher than last year and continue to challenge buyers and the housing market overall.
“Apart from the ARM loan rate, rates for all other loan types were more than three percentage points higher than they were a year ago,” Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist, said in a statement.
“These elevated rates continue to put pressure on both purchase and refinance activity and have added to the ongoing affordability challenges impacting the broader housing market, as seen in the deteriorating trends in housing starts and home sales,” Kan added.
Meanwhile, the share of refinance activity stayed low as homeowners are hesitant to risk losing their low rates.
“With most homeowners locked into significantly lower rates, refinance applications continued to run more than 80 percent below last year’s pace, while the refinance share of applications was 28.6 percent – the fifth straight week below 30 percent,” Kan said.
The drop in mortgage rates follows months of steady increases fueled by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest hikes to curb rising inflation. And experts expect the Fed to increase rates again during the U.S. central bank’s meeting on Wednesday.
Overall, the Fed’s fight with inflation has led to a dramatic cooling of the once red-hot housing market.
Surging rates in recent weeks have led to record home price deceleration and plummeting pending sales. The number of homes under contract fell for the fourth consecutive month in September, declining by 10.2 percent from August, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
And NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects high rates to linger.
“The new normal for mortgage rates could be around 7% for a while,” Yun said in a statement last week.
“On a $300,000 loan, that translates to a typical monthly mortgage payment of nearly $2,000, compared to $1,265 just one year ago – a difference of more than $700 per month. Only when inflation is tamed will mortgage rates retreat and boost home purchasing power for buyers,” Yun said.


U.S. Treasury yields fell Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's November meeting.
The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield reversed some of Tuesday's gains and was last trading at around 4.5074%. Yields and prices have an inverted relationship. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.
By 5:30 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was down by less than a basis point to 4.0464%.
U.S. Treasury yields fell Wednesday ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's November meeting where markets expect a 75 basis point interest rate hike and signals about future policy.
The Federal Reserve is expected to remain hawkish and announce the fourth consecutive 75 basis point rate hike on Wednesday as it continues to push back against persistent inflation.
Data released on Tuesday showed that job openings had surged more than expected in September. This tightness in the labor market has been one of the key drivers of soaring inflation, making this a key figure for Fed policy makers.
Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers' index) reflected that factory activity growth slowed again in October and came close to contracting.
Economic slowdown is one of the main market concerns when it comes to interest rate hikes.
Investors are therefore hoping that the Federal Reserve will also provide some guidance on future policy plans and whether interest rate hikes will slow or pause entirely.
Markets will also gain further insights into the labor market on Wednesday as ADP's employment report is due.

The dollar's retreat in foreign exchange markets is temporary, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists, who said the greenback still had enough strength left to reclaim or surpass its recent highs and resume its relentless rise. Up around 16.0% for the year, the dollar has come off an over-two-decade peak it hit in September, as the U.S. Federal Reserve, which powered the currency's rally, was expected to be nearing the end of its interest rate tightening cycle. The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by 75 basis points on Wednesday, its fourth jumbo increase in a row.


Traders will be watching Wednesday for an expected interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve and comments from Chairman Jerome Powell, and multiple labor-related and earnings reports.
Here are the key events taking place on Wednesday that could impact trading.
FED MEETING: The central bank is widely expected to raise the Federal Funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.75%-4%, up from the current range of 3%-3.25%.
It would be the central bank’s fourth consecutive 75-basis point rate hike, following moves in September, July and June. Prior to June, the Fed hadn’t done a 75 bps rate increase since November 1994.
The Fed lifted the Funds rate by half a point in May and a quarter-point in March. Before that, the Funds rate had been in a 0%-0.25% range following two emergency rate cuts in March 2020 in response to the global pandemic:
