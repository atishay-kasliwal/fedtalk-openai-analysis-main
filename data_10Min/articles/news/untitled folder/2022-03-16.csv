39,The Federal Reserve lifted its policy interest rate for the first time since 2018 and penciled in six more rate increases this year as it tries to combat a burst of quick price increases.
40,The Federal Reserve lifted its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday as policymakers took their first decisive step toward trying to tame rapid inflation by cooling the economy.
41,"The Fed had kept rates near zero since March 2020, and the decision marked its first increase since 2018."
42,"Policymakers also projected six more similarly sized increases over the course of 2022 as inflation comes in at a 40-year high, signaling that they are going to pull back support for the economy markedly."
43,"“The economy no longer needs — or wants — these, this very highly accommodative stance,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during his post-meeting news conference."
44,The Fed is at an inflection point after two years of trying to help the economy to recover from the damage inflicted by the global pandemic.
45,"While the coronavirus continues to disrupt commerce around the world, the United States economy has staged a swift recovery."
46,"America’s job market has rebounded rapidly from steep pandemic job losses that had pushed unemployment to 14.7 percent, and businesses are now struggling to find workers."
47,A surge in consumer spending has helped to push the rate of inflation to levels not seen since the 1980s.
48,Instead of echoing the anemic slog back from the 2007-9 recession — one that kept millions of applicants out of work and left inflation tepid despite years of rock-bottom rates — the pandemic bounce-back has been vigorous.
49,"Judging by inflation, it may even have too much heat, which is why the Fed is trying to slow the economy down to a more sustainable pace."
50,"“We’ve had price stability for a very long time, and maybe come to take it for granted — but now we see the pain,” Mr. Powell said."
51,"“We’re strongly committed, as a committee, to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched, and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels.”
 Mr. Powell said the labor market and economy are so strong that the Fed thinks that both can handle higher interest rates."
52,He said he does not expect a recession this year.
53,"“The economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases,” he said."
54,"Higher interest rates will trickle out through markets to make mortgages, car loans and borrowing by businesses more expensive."
55,"That is expected to slow consumption and investment, reducing demand in the economy and — Fed officials hope — eventually weighing down surging prices."
56,"Central bankers plotted a notably more aggressive plan for controlling inflation than in December, when they last released economic projections."
57,"Officials now expect to raise rates to 2.8 percent by the end of 2023, based on the median estimate, up from 1.6 percent in their prior projections."
58,"That is high enough that, by the Fed’s own estimates, it might amount to actually tapping the brakes on the economy — not just taking a foot off the gas pedal."
59,The Fed’s Current Projections What Federal Reserve officials think rates should be in the next two years.
60,End of 2023 End of 2022 Five Fed officials now think that rates could be higher than 3 percent by the end of 2023.
61,3.5 % 3.0 2.5 2.0 Each rectangle represents one Fed official’s judgment.
62,1.5 1.0 Current target rate 0.25% to 0.5% range 0.5 0 End of 2023 End of 2022 4.0 % Each square represents one Fed official’s judgment.
63,3.5 Five Fed officials now think that rates could be higher than 3 percent by the end of 2023.
64,"3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 Current target rate 0.25% to 0.5% range 0
 “They knew their policy didn’t match the economic backdrop, and this is catch-up,” said Priya Misra, the head of global rates strategy at TD Securities."
65,"“They’re giving a tough message that they expect they will have to slow growth to bring inflation under control.”
 With the help of their policy changes, central bankers expect inflation to begin to moderate on its own this year, but they have become concerned that a meaningful deceleration will take time."
66,"The Fed’s quarterly economic projections, released alongside the rate decision, showed that officials expected inflation to hover around 4.3 percent at the end of 2022."
67,"While that is less than 6.1 percent increase in the 12 months through January, it is well above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent."
68,Mr. Powell on Wednesday noted that inflation is “well above” the Fed’s target and that supply chain disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than expected.
69,"Higher energy prices are further elevating inflation just as price increases broaden beyond areas directly impacted by the pandemic, seeping into rent and other service prices."
70,"“High inflation takes a toll on everyone, but really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation,” Mr. Powell said."
71,"The Fed aims for both price stability and maximum employment, and central bank officials have indicated that the labor market is meeting that latter goal, though they hope more workers will return as fears of catching the coronavirus ease and as child-care issues tied to school shutdowns and other virus mitigation measures fade."
72,"Unemployment has dropped sharply, job openings are plentiful, and there are too few workers to go around."
73,A booming job market has helped to push wage growth higher because employers are competing for workers and trying to retain their existing employees by paying more.
74,"Higher compensation could fuel inflation down the road, some economists worry: It gives workers more wherewithal to spend, and it leaves firms trying to cover climbing labor costs."
75,"From an inflation standpoint, Mr. Powell said, recent wage growth has not been sustainable."
76,"There is a “misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market, and that is leading to wages moving up in ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,” he said."
77,"James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, voted against the committee’s decision because he favored a larger interest rate increase of half a percentage point."
78,Mr. Bullard and some other Fed officials have argued that it would be a good idea to move rates up more quickly at first to signal that the central bank is prepared to beat back rapid price increases.
79,"But Mr. Powell made clear that, even if it is moving rates up steadily, the central bank as a whole knows it needs to act to restore price stability."
80,"“We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched,” Mr. Powell said."
81,"At the same time, the Fed does not want to stoke uncertainty at a moment of towering geopolitical tensions."
82,The Federal Open Market Committee directly addressed the possible economic implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in its statement.
83,"“The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,” Fed officials said in their statement."
84,"“The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”
 While Mr. Powell reinforced time and again how important it is to do whatever it takes to get inflation under control, he also made it clear that central bankers are hoping to engineer a soft landing: A situation where they can slow growth down to a maintainable level without derailing the economy and causing a recession."
85,"Image Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, earlier this month."
86,"Credit... T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times
 Asked about that calibration on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that, in his view, “the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.” He cited strong demand, a healthy labor market and other conditions that he said were “signs” that the economy will be able to flourish “in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.”
 In the 1980s, the Fed pushed interest rates to high levels — above the level of inflation — in order to slow the economy and weigh down inflation."
87,"In the process, central bank policy caused a recession that pushed unemployment up to nearly 11 percent."
88,"Most economists have said that such a painful repeat is unlikely, though many have warned that a gentle, easy end to the current inflationary burst is not assured."
89,"“It is way too soon to say it’s a pipe dream; it’s been a crazy year,” Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University, said earlier this week of the possibility of a soft landing."
90,"“It feels, with every passing month, increasingly unlikely.”
 But the effects of the Fed’s actions to control inflation are likely to be palpable."
91,"Mortgage rates have already climbed thanks to the central bank’s signals that it would raise interest rates and, in coming months, begin to trim its balance sheet of bond holdings."
92,"As higher rates weigh on hiring, they could eventually slow wage growth, and higher borrowing costs are likely to keep asset prices — including for stocks and homes — from rising as much as they draw buyers and investors away."
93,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, but it's how hawkish Jerome Powell and the Fed sound in the forecast that's key for the U.S. economy."
94,"""It is high and elevated and rising at a rapid pace,"" she said."
95,"""The Fed has to worry about inflation."
96,We're not talking about just 3%.
97,It's close to 8%.
98,"This is a massive overshoot."""
99,"Fed Chair Powell indicated during recent testimony that he sees inflation running a little faster than the Fed's previous expectation, and any adjustment from the Fed is significant, Bostjancic said."
100,But her view of the inflation outlook remains much higher than the median forecast of 2.7% year over year through Q4 2022 — closer to 4% than 3%.
101,"This is based on a labor market that is strong and a consumer that is resilient, and the Fed being behind the curve on inflation already."
102,"But it's not the base case for Bostjancic, even if she says the Fed won't be blind to these signals."
103,There are risks on both sides of the Fed equation.
104,"If it is too hawkish and tightens too quickly, that can send the financial markets into a convulsion and lead to a mass selling of risk assets which feeds back into the real economy."
105,"Recent action in the bond market showing a narrowing of the spread between the two-year and 10-year treasuries stoked fears of an inverted yield curve, which is a signal that this worst-case, recessionary scenario, could play out."
106,"While there are complicating factors such as the war in Ukraine, the most prominent issue for the Fed is that economic growth remains quite strong."
107,"If the Fed is shy about raising rates and reducing the balance sheet because of war, there is a risk that it gets even further behind on inflation, Bostjancic says."
108,"Consumers are still sitting on a high level of savings and benefitting from rising wages, and if the Fed gets further behind the curve on inflation by waiting, it will only increase the risk of the central bank becoming more hawkish later on."
109,"The Federal Reserve is about to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018, but it's already time for the market to look past this well-telegraphed move, according to Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics."
110,"The ""dot plot"" and the Fed's economic projections for GDP and inflation will need to be digested by the market, but ultimately, it's how Fed Chair Jerome Powell frames the Fed thinking on Wednesday that matters most."
111,"""I want to hear how he handicaps the risks around growth and inflation."
112,"That will tell me something about the Fed's reaction function and that is the forward guidance,"" Bostjancic said."
113,"While oil prices and the pain at the pump, which eased this week, caught the market's attention amid the outbreak of war in Europe, Bostjancic says food prices have double the weight of energy in the consumer price index and loom as an even larger factor in the inflation outlook — and are not immune to war."
114,"Commodities prices rising sharping are likely to get worse because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which impacts the production of wheat among other commodities and will reverberate through the global supply chain and ""turbocharge food prices even higher,"" she said."
115,"Powell has already said rate hikes are coming, in spite of the outbreak of war."
116,"Oxford Economics is in line with a market view of 175 basis points of total tightening by the Fed this year, but isn't sure whether those hikes remain limited to 25 basis points or include the potential for a 50 basis point hike at some point."
117,"""Our view is that the economy is strong enough and demand still strong enough that even with the impact from war we still see growth at 3% or higher this year, so the Fed needs to get to a neutral rate as quickly as possible without destabilizing the market,"" Bostjancic said."
118,"The situation is not ""dramatically different"" for the U.S.,"" she said."
119,"The U.S. economy is not immune to the war, but compared to Europe's economy, it is much better insulated."
120,"""I don't think Ukraine necessarily slows the economy enough to take the edge off inflation,"" she added."
121,"Powell will need to provide a view on where his concern primarily lies — how does the shock of this war impacts the U.S. economy versus the shock on the inflation side and the growth side, and the market will be looking closely for any signals from the Fed chair on what he emphasizes more in the risk analysis."
122,"But in the end, Bostjancic says, ""The Fed has to come in."
123,"It can't control the war even if there is a knock-on effect in supply chains and scarcity of food and oil occur."""
124,There is also no way for a central bank to project the potential for a ceasefire in war.
125,"Even in Europe, the ECB recently showed itself to be more hawkish in inclination, holding rates but saying it would wind down stimulus sooner rather than later."
126,"""They need to fight inflation even if growth is slowing,"" Bostjancic said, and the ECB's recent policy views match an outlook on the Fed that suggests it can be more hawkish even in the face of larger uncertainty."
127,"The war could potentially delay the Fed's balance sheet runoff, but by a month or two, and in her view, it should not alter the general path of normalization of both rates and the Fed's holdings in the bond market."
128,"While this week's producer price index showed a slight undershoot of the inflation expectation and the latest wage inflation reading came down, the recent flow of data has reinforced that the inflationary pressures are still widespread and elevated, and the Fed needs to raise rates and has the ability to raise in a significant way."
129,"""They have to come in and cool things off,"" Bostjancic said."
130,"The market has already priced in an aggressive rate hike profile, and the market is not likely to be told by the Fed to price in less than it already has."
131,"""The market is already in tightening conditions without the Fed having to do it."
132,"It's doing the work for the Fed,"" she said."
133,"Wall Street's main indexes jumped on Wednesday, propelled by technology and financial stocks, as signs of progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks lifted sentiment ahead of a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve."

140,"The Fed is seen raising interest rates by at least 25 basis points later on Wednesday, in what would be the first in a series of increases this year as it steps up the fight against stubbornly high inflation."
141,The policy statement is due at 2 p.m.
142,ET (1800 GMT) and will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's news conference.
143,Traders will be closely watching the updated quarterly economic and interest rate projections for clues on how fast rates will increase.
144,"""The Fed in some ways was behind the curve."
145,"It gives the market a sense of comfort that the Fed is on the ball, they're going to start moving interest rates and we could get to a place where inflation begins to temper,"" said John Cunnison, chief investment officer at Baker Boyer in Walla Walla, Washington."
146,"""Any good news on Ukraine is very likely to give market participants confidence that the Fed can increase rates without hurting growth."""

 The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said Thursday the policy rates would remain data driven, and not dependent on the action by the US Federal Reserve which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018."
196,"The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said Thursday the policy rates would remain data driven, and not dependent on the action by the US Federal Reserve which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018."
197,"“We don’t need to move in pace with the Fed… but we will review our inflation outlook in our incoming policy meeting,” Diokno said, adding any policy decision by the Monetary Board would remain data driven—such as the latest numbers on inflation and domestic output—to avoid “unintended consequences.”
 “The BSP has various tools."
198,We have strong external buffers and liquidity-enhancing tools to stem the volatility that may arise due to the [US Fed] tightening.
199,"Our decision remains data dependent,” Diokno said."
200,The Federal Reserve on Wednesday increased interest rates and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels next year.
201,"After keeping its benchmark interest rate anchored near zero since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would raise rates by 25 basis points, bringing the rate now into a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent."
202,The move will correspond with a hike in the prime rate and immediately send financing costs higher for many forms of consumer borrowing and credit.
203,Fed officials indicated the rate increases would come with slower economic growth this year.
204,"ADVERTISEMENT
 Diokno earier said there was no certain timetable for the BSP’s exit strategy from its pandemic interventions, especially with the onset of new COVID-19 variants that threaten the sustained recovery of the economy."
205,"“We deem it prudent to leave some room for flexibility in policymaking to account for uncertainty and risk, especially as the situation remains very fluid,” he said."
206,Diokno said the timing and conditions under which the BSP would start unwinding its pandemic-induced interventions would continue to be guided by the inflation and growth outlook over the medium term and the risks surrounding such outlook.
207,"Julito G. Rada
 The BSP in 2020 reduced the policy rate by a total of 200 basis points to a record-low 2 percent, and the reserve requirement ratios by another 200 basis points to 12 percent in a bid to unleash more liquidity into the financial system to be used by individuals and firms for productive activities."
208,It also extended provisional advances—a temporary arrangement between the BSP and the national government—to provide the government access to ample cash resources while revenue generation is weakened and fulfillment of the borrowing program is challenged by the scale of the borrowing need and the unpredictability of financial markets amid the pandemic.
209,The BSP injected around P2.3 trillion worth of liquidity into the domestic economy since the pandemic struck.

212,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled Oversight of the Treasury Department's and Federal Reserve's Pandemic Response, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, December 1, 2021."
213,"The Federal Reserve will likely ""increasingly err on the side of hawkish"" in its approach for the remainder of 2022, says Moody's Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi."
214,"The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, which would mark its first interest rate hike since December 2018."
215,It also reflects a significant departure from the easing put in place to aid the economy through the pandemic.
216,"The expected rate hike reflects ""where inflation is, where inflation expectations are, and just given the strength of the economy and a job market that is rip roaring,"" Zandi said."
217,"The Fed's decision is further compounded by uncertainty around the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and further supply chain disruptions."
218,"""You add all that up, it says the Fed has to normalize interest rates quickly, and I think at this point more quickly than they think, at least in terms of their last forecast, and maybe even more quickly than what the markets think at this point,"" Zandi said."
219,Nearly half of the respondents to the latest CNBC Fed Survey said they see the central bank hiking rates five to seven times this year.
220,"While the survey shows that the rate hike cycle is seen ending at a peak fund rates of 2.4%, half of all respondents said they believe the central bank may have to raise rates above neutral to get control of inflation."
221,"Zandi said there could be worries of stagflation, but he believes the Fed would ""short circuit that before we actually get stagflation."
222,"I don't think they'll tolerate stagflation because they know based on historical experience that if we get into that scenario, we'll ultimately suffer a recession."""
223,"CNBC Fed Survey respondents see the probability of a recession occurring in the U.S. at 33% in the next 12 months, up 10 percentage points from the Feb. 1 survey."
224,"Recent action in the bond market showing the spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds narrowing stoked fears of a yield inversion, which has been a recession signal in the past."
225,"At this point, Zandi said the fixed income markets are saying that the ""number one problem here that they've got to resolve is high inflation, inflation expectations."
226,"But doing that without breaking the economy, pushing it into a recession is very difficult ... right now, the bond market is signaling a high probability that the Fed missteps and fails."""
227,"""I don't think the market is signaling yet a recession but they're thinking along the same lines that I am – that it's going to be very difficult for the Federal Reserve to land the plane on the tarmac given all the things that are going on and all the things they have to navigate."""
228,That uncertainty was certainly noted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his appearance before Congress on March 2.
229,"""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways,"" Powell said."

253,It would be the first rate hike since 2018 as the central bank looks to rein in inflation.
254,The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates on Wednesday – a move to combat soaring inflation as the U.S. comes out of the pandemic and economic uncertainty in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
255,The expected quarter-point hike comes as prices have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years.
256,Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a congressional hearing earlier this month that he supports raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%.
257,Interest rates have been near 0% for about two years since the central bank cut rates as the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020.
258,This will be the first time the central bank has hiked the rate since the end of 2018.
259,Prices have increased 7.9% over the past year – the fastest rate of inflation since 1982.
260,"Last month, prices were up 0.8% – an acceleration from January."
261,"Personal consumption expenditures, the preferred measure used by the Federal Reserve, showed prices, excluding often-volatile food and energy, up 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% in January."
262,"While Powell signaled how much he wanted to raise the rate at the March meeting, he did not say how often he saw the Federal Reserve raising rates or by how much at subsequent meetings."
263,Some economists have called for a more aggressive approach – with a .50% rate hike right out of the gate.
264,"""They're behind the curve,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com of the Federal Reserve."
265,"""If it hadn't been for the situation in Ukraine, there's a fair chance they would have come out of the box with a larger half-point increase."""
266,"The United States and its allies have slapped sanctions on Russian banks, businesses and individuals and restricted trade over its invasion of Ukraine, adding uncertainty as the Central Bank moves to rein in soaring prices."
267,"""The timing couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk."
268,"""The disruptions we are seeing are adding fuel to a well kindled inflation fire that goes well beyond the energy sector and could touch much more of our daily lives."""
269,"Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the short and medium term have gone up, according to the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reversing declines in January."
270,"As prices continue to skyrocket, economists have been increasing their forecasts on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year – which could be as many as seven times."
271,"If the Federal Reserve raises the federal interest rate, borrowing costs are going to go up for consumers."
272,"For credit card holders, a first increase of 0.25% may be inconsequential but multiple rate hikes over the next year or so could add up."
273,"""It's that cumulative effect that should prompt you to take action now,"" said McBride."
274,"""Look to grab a 0% or other low rate balance transfer offer that can insulate you from the rate hikes we expect to see."""
275,Mortgage rates have already been going up over the past few months in anticipation of higher rates and due to inflation.
276,Auto loan rates are also expected to rise.
277,"Should the Fed be more aggressive with raising interest rates, coupled with tightening spending power from higher costs for goods such as food and gas, economists have warned the chances of a recession next year have gone up."
278,"But speaking Friday ahead of the Fed meeting, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who previously chaired the Federal Reserve, said the economy is strong and households in general are in good financial shape."
279,She noted record job creation and declines in unemployment.
280,"Last month, the unemployment rate hit 3.8%."
281,"""One reason one might worry about a recession is that you think that monetary policy in bringing down inflation can cause that."
282,"We have seen that on some occasions in the past, but we've also seen episodes in which there is a soft landing,"" said Yellen."
283,"""I have confidence in the Fed to get inflation under control without causing a recession."""
284,"The Federal Reserve is expected today to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25%, marking the central bank's first substantial move to quell high inflation as prices rise at paces not seen in about 40 years."
285,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25%, marking the central bank's first substantial move to quell high inflation as prices rise at paces not seen in about 40 years, Wednesday afternoon."
286,The Fed has not raised interest rates since 2018.
287,"In the face of the COVID pandemic, the central bank slashed the target on its benchmark interest rate to near zero — where it has remained for two years."
288,More interest rate increases will be needed to slow inflation in the U.S. Fed policymakers will also likely lean on a reduction in its $9 trillion balance sheet to further pull back on its support to the economy.
289,But the Fed will have to navigate carefully.
290,A war in Ukraine and COVID-induced shutdowns in China are raising the risk of a Fed tightening cycle in the midst of a global slowdown.
291,When the central bank releases its policy statement at 2 p.m.
292,"ET, keep an eye on the set of economic projections to be released alongside the statement."
293,"A round of ""dot plots"" mapping out each Fed policymaker's forecast for future interest rate hikes will be key to understanding the central bank's aggression in tackling inflation."
294,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will answer questions from the press following the Fed's decision at 2:30 p.m.

 Central banks are moving to tamp down inflation, with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday
 Canada’s inflation rate hit a new three-decade high in February as consumers faced an array of price increases, adding pressure on the Bank of Canada to tame the situation with a speedy course of interest-rate hikes."
300,"The Consumer Price Index rose 5.7 per cent in February from a year earlier, up from 5.1 per cent in January, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday."
301,"That was the highest inflation rate since August, 1991, and it marked the 11th consecutive month that inflation has surpassed the Bank of Canada’s target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent."
302,Households are feeling the pinch on several fronts.
303,"Shelter costs rose 6.6 per cent, for the largest annual increase since 1983."
304,"Groceries rose 7.4 per cent, the most since 2009."
305,And gas prices jumped 6.9 per cent in a single month.
306,"The average of the central bank’s core measures of inflation – which strip out volatile components and give a better sense of broad-based price increases – rose to 3.5 per cent, also the highest since 1991."
307,"Around two-thirds of the goods and services that make up Statscan’s CPI basket are experiencing inflation of more than 3 per cent, showing how sticker shock is getting tougher to avoid."
308,"“If it feels like everything is getting more expensive, it’s because it is,” Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Securities Inc., said in a note to clients."
309,Central bankers have embarked on a lengthy process to tamp down inflation.
310,"The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday from record lows, and for the first time since 2018."
311,The Bank of Canada did the same earlier this month.
312,Financial analysts expect both central banks to raise borrowing costs several times this year and next.
313,"Rising prices, interest rates and inflation signal nauseating conditions for homebuyers this spring
 Why inflation, commodities shocks are in the usual recipe for a recession
 Throughout the pandemic, central bankers have consistently underestimated the scale and duration of inflation."
314,The Bank of Canada in January projected that annual rates would average 5.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 – a forecast that is already short of reality.
315,The U.S. inflation rate hit a 40-year high of 7.9 per cent in February.
316,"The latest threat to consumer prices is the Russia-Ukraine war, which has led to surging costs for wheat, gasoline, fertilizer and other products, on fears of supply shortages."
317,"However, central bankers can do very little to calm volatility in global commodity markets, making the situation even more complicated."
318,Several analysts said on Wednesday that Canada’s inflation rate could reach – or exceed – 6 per cent in short order.
319,"“Whether it’s a supply or demand shock is becoming less and less consequential,” said Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia."
320,"The central bank is “behind the curve” on rate hikes “and they need to move aggressively to try and signal that they’re very serious about bringing inflation back to target.”
 In a recent speech, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem would not rule out a rate hike of 50 basis points later this year."
321,(A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)
322,A hike of that magnitude has not happened since 2000.
323,"A key concern is that consumers, who are sensitive to price increases at gas pumps and supermarkets, will begin to see steep inflation as a long-term reality."
324,"Inflation can be self-fulfilling, in that companies set prices and workers negotiate wages in anticipation of expected costs."
325,"Their expectations of inflation over the next two years have risen substantially, but remain “well anchored” over a five-year horizon, the central bank has said."
326,Not everyone agrees.
327,Scotiabank said on Tuesday that inflation expectations have already become unmoored.
328,"“As of late 2021, the [central bank’s] priority should have been squarely on inflation” rather than supporting the labour market, read the report, which was co-written by René Lalonde, a former research director at the Bank of Canada."
329,"Scotiabank estimates the central bank’s key interest rate – now at 0.5 per cent – will end the year at 2.5 per cent, which is the quickest pace of rate hikes that a major bank is projecting."
330,That would heap pressure on a Canadian consumer who is loaded up on debt.
331,"The household debt burden – more formally known as the ratio of credit market debt to disposable income – rose to 186 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest on record."
332,The pandemic debt surge has been entirely driven by demand for residential mortgages.
333,Mr. Perrault said Canadians can handle a quick pace of rate hikes.
334,"The economy is growing quickly, highlighted by the addition of nearly 340,000 jobs in February, which took the employment rate back to prepandemic levels."
335,"“Rates are rising in a remarkably strong growth environment,” he said."
336,"“To us, that means households are going to have much greater flexibility and greater ability to manage these higher rates than would be the case if inflation was going up and growth was not there.”
 In February, consumers felt the impact of higher prices for dairy products, which rose 3.7 per cent from January."
337,"That stemmed from a decision last year by the Canadian Dairy Commission, a Crown corporation, to greatly increase the price that farmers receive for milk and butter, citing higher production costs."
338,"The decision was widely panned over its opaque nature and insensitive timing, given that grocery prices were already inflating quickly."
339,"Food processors and retailers have passed on those higher costs, which took effect on Feb. 1."
340,"The price of fresh milk jumped 5.8 per cent, the fastest month-over-month pace since 1994, Wednesday’s report showed."
341,Statscan noted that prices for all dairy products increased in February.

 The Federal Reserve must balance their two goals of maximum employment and price stability."

368,They have the skills and judgment needed to fight inflation and maintain economic stability as we continue recovering from the pandemic.
369,"In their current roles at the Federal Reserve, Powell and Brainard have helped steer the U.S. economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, and their renominations will ensure continuity and confidence in Federal Reserve leadership."

374,"In a Feb. 8 letter to Senate Leadership and the Senate Banking Committee, I joined 180 of the top economic policymakers and scholars in the country to urge a swift approval of these nominees."
375,"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans on the Banking Committee are not having rigorous debate on the merits of the candidates, or providing valuable oversight to the process."

385,These are not political decisions.
386,The goals are clear: steer the economy toward maximum employment and stable prices.
387,The problem is that the Federal Reserve has been left without the team of people who lead these discussions and vote on the decision.

 March 16 (UPI) -- For the first time since 2018, the U.S. central bank is expected to increase interest rates during a policy meeting on Wednesday, a measure to fight rising inflation that's being affected by high gas prices and Russia's war in Ukraine."
394,"The Federal Reserve will conclude its policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon, at which time it's expected to announce a quarter-point rate increase."
395,The rate has been near zero since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
396,The Fed could also set a forecast for future increases.
397,"Advertisement
 The primary factors pressing the need for a rate hike include the rising costs of fuel and food."
398,Government figures for February showed that U.S. inflation rose on a 12-month basis to the highest level in 40 years.
399,"The Federal Reserve is also facing fresh uncertainties, including the fighting in Ukraine that's led to a U.S. oil embargo and rising prices at the pump."
400,A new spike in coronavirus cases in China may also cause new supply chain issues.
401,Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers earlier this month that he favors a rate hike at Wednesday's meeting.

 The Federal Reserve is set to raise borrowing costs enough to tame inflation but not too much to send the economy into a recession."
414,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will launch one of the most difficult tasks a central bank can attempt: Raise borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, but not so much as to topple the economy into recession.With a war raging in Europe and price increases at a four-decade high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will seek to engineer a ""soft landing"": A gradual slowdown in economic activity that helps curb surging prices, while keeping the job market and economy expanding.Yet many economists worry that with the price of gas and commodities spiking, the additional burden of higher interest rates could choke off growth entirely."
415,"""You've got to be both lucky and good"" to avoid causing a downturn, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served as vice chair of the Fed from 1994 to 1996, when the central bank was widely seen as achieving a soft landing.As a first step, the Fed is set to raise borrowing rates several times this year, beginning this week with a quarter-point increase in its benchmark short-term rate."
416,"Policymakers will also discuss when and how fast to shrink the Fed's $9 trillion in bond holdings, a step that would also have the effect of tightening credit for consumers and businesses.Such moves mark a sharp turn away from the Fed's ultra-low-rate policies, which it enacted when the pandemic recession erupted two years ago."
417,"By pinning its key rate near zero for two years and buying trillions in bonds, the Fed has kept borrowing costs at historically low levels and helped boost stock prices.The Fed, by its own admission, underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck."
418,"Many economists say the central bank made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates.The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which reached a record low of 2.65% in January 2021, has jumped to 3.85% in the past three months, as Powell has signaled the Fed's intentions and inflation has spiraled higher.By raising short-term rates, the Fed hopes to make it costlier to buy homes and cars and to boost credit card rates and borrowing costs for businesses."
419,"The resulting pullback in spending should, in turn, slow inflation, Powell told Congress two weeks ago."
420,"Strong consumer spending, fueled by stimulus checks and steady hiring and pay raises, has collided with supply shortfalls to raise inflation to 7.9%, the highest rate since 1982."
421,"""People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,"" Powell said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low - it's now 3.8% - or fall further."
422,"""I think it's more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing,"" Powell told a House panel a day before his Senate testimony.Yet the Fed faces a dizzying array of uncertainties that will make its task particularly challenging."
423,The economy is still working through shortages of labor and parts stemming from the disruptions of the pandemic.
424,"And now prices are rising further for oil, gas, wheat, and other commodities because of Russia's war against Ukraine.The clearest soft landing was achieved in 1994 and 1995, when the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan raised its benchmark rate from 3% to 6% as the economy was rebounding after a brief recession."
425,"Inflation, which wasn't a problem then, declined further."
426,And unemployment leveled off at about 5.5% before resuming its decline two years later.Blinder calculates that the Fed also engineered soft landings in 1965 and 1983.
427,"But he worries that this time, the odds are stacked against the Fed and that its rate hikes may end up causing an economic setback."
428,"""It's just so hard in this environment,"" he said."
429,"""You have to have a world in which nothing comes to knock over the apple cart."
430,"And for Jay Powell and the Fed, the whole world is just apple cart after apple cart getting knocked over."
431,"""One of those apple carts is the sharp rise in gas prices since the invasion, up 65 cents to $4.33 a gallon, on average, nationwide."
432,"The increase will send inflation higher, while probably also slowing growth - two conflicting trends that are difficult for the Fed to manage simultaneously.Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.9%, down from a previous estimate of 3.1%."
433,"Others foresee growth decelerating to 2%, down from 5.7% last year.The economy's steady expansion does provide some cushion against higher rates and more expensive gas."
434,"Consumers are spending at a healthy pace, and employers keep rapidly hiring."
435,"There are still 11.3 million job openings, far outnumbering the unemployed.In 1998, the late MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch wrote that economic expansions didn't die of ""natural causes."""
436,"Rather, he said, ""they were all murdered by the Fed over the issue of inflation."""
437,He meant that the Fed raised rates too much out of fear of inflation and failed to achieve a soft landing.Yet many economists say that view is outdated and refers mostly to Fed policies from the 1950s through early 1980s.
438,The Fed now operates differently.
439,It communicates its plans more clearly with the public.
440,"And it pays closer attention to factors such as inflation expectations, which measure where consumers, businesses and investors see inflation heading.Such measures are important because if people think inflation will head higher, they will demand bigger paychecks."
441,"Companies, in turn, will raise prices further to offset their higher labor costs.Inflation expectations, particularly in the short-term, have been rising steadily, though longer-term measures suggest that people still expect inflation to return closer to the Fed's 2% annual target over time.Emi Nakamura, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that in the 1970s, even as inflation soared, it was still a matter of debate among economists whether the Fed's rate policies could truly control inflation.Yet if the Fed keeps raising rates for another year or two, as many economists expect, it could eventually lift them high enough that consumers and business reduce spending and throw the economy into reverse."
442,"Unemployment would rise and a downturn could begin.Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont, suggested, though, that the Fed won't reach that possibility until next year or later."
443,"""Let's at least get a few rate hikes under our belt before we start worrying about that,"" he said."
444,"""We have some distance to go before that becomes a realistic worry."""
