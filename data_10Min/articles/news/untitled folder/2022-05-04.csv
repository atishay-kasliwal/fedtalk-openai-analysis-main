0,"The Federal Reserve is expected to announce that it lifted its core interest rate by as much as 0.5%, its second hike in two months as it works to cool inflation
 The Federal Reserve is expected to lift its core interest rate by as much as 0.5 percent on Wednesday — its second hike in two months as the central bank works to fight inflation levels that have reached 40-year highs."
1,"The widely expected move comes as the Fed seeks to cool off a pandemic recovery that has produced stellar job growth, but that has come against a backdrop of soaring prices across a range of goods and services, from gas to real estate."
2,"Labor, too, has gotten more expensive, fueling shortages and putting pressure on the Fed to slow companies' expansion plans."
3,"Thanks to prior comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, higher rates have already begun to show up in everyday borrowing transactions for products including homes and autos, according to Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group."
4,"""Where we're more likely to see them [higher rates] show up now in is short-term borrowing costs,"" Faucher said."
5,"""So one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, CD [certificate of deposit] rates may move up a little bit."""
6,"While surging prices have historically come amid sputtering economic growth, many economists see the U.S.'s current financial picture as one that has been able to largely absorb recent leaps in the cost of goods."
7,"Still, there remains some concern that the Fed has fallen behind when it comes to fighting inflation, and that it could end up having to raise rates so aggressively that it ends up tipping the economy into a recession."
8,"As economists at Bank of America wrote in a note to investors Monday, markets believe the Fed may have to set the federal funds rate beyond 3 percent to cool down inflation by making it more expensive to borrow."
9,The current core or federal funds rate is now 0.33 percent.
10,Some economists were encouraged by data Monday that showed a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing activity as one reason why the Fed may not have to be as aggressive in raising rates as some have feared in recent months.
11,"Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is among those who believe inflation likely peaked in March, meaning the Fed will be able to slow its pace of interest rate hikes."
12,"In a note to clients Monday, Shepherdson also cited ""the rollover in housing demand, the impending steep drop in inflation, and the broad tightening of financial conditions"" as arguments against ""endless"" rate hikes."
13,"""None of this will prevent a 50 [basis point] hike [Wednesday], or likely in June, but we are on the alert for markets to start scaling back their expectations for mid-summer onwards."""
14,But PNC's Faucher said he believes a recession could still come in the next 24 months or so.
15,He puts the odds that the economy goes into reverse at about 1 in 3.
16,"""The Fed may decide we need to experience a mild recession to bring down wage-inflationary pressures,"" Faucher said."
17,"""But the good news is starting from a very good place in the labor market."""
18,"As a result, Faucher said, job losses are more likely to be concentrated in areas like housing and other durable goods that are interest-rate sensitive, as opposed to services consumption."
19,"Still, he said, the next few years are likely to be turbulent."
20,"""Right now the economy looks good,"" Faucher said."
21,"""We've got good job growth, good consumer spending growth, so we are not in imminent danger of a recession — but the risk is elevated, and even if we don’t get a recession, things are going to be bumpy the next couple of years."""
22,"Turmoil on Wall Street is a feature, not a bug, of the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation, according to former New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley."
23,"New York (CNN Business) Turmoil on Wall Street is a feature, not a bug, of the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation, according to former New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley."
24,"""What's happening right now is exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to happen,"" Dudley told CNN in an interview, referring to recent volatility in the financial markets
 Turbulence on Wall Street has increased as investors worry about a potential recession and brace for a series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve."
25,"The S&P 500 lost more than 13% of its value between January and April, marking its worst start to a year since 1939
 ""They want a weaker stock market."
26,"They want higher bond yields,"" Dudley said."
27,"""The stock market I think is finally catching onto that."""
28,The Fed came to the rescue in March 2020 by slashing interest rates to zero and promising to purchase trillions of dollars in bonds.
29,"Those moves laid the foundation for blockbuster returns in the stock market, gains that helped revive confidence in the US economy after the onset of Covid-19."

106,London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve is finally getting aggressive in its bid to fight decades-high inflation .
107,What's happening: The central bank is expected to hike interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday for the first time since 2000.
108,Investors think it will deliver hikes of the same magnitude in June and July.
109,But arriving late to the scene will have consequences.
110,Boosting rates just as growth starts slowing comes with a heightened risk of cooling activity so much it triggers a recession.
111,"And in just a few months, the Fed may pay the price for playing catch-up."
112,"""I think they're paying too much attention to what's happened in the past and not enough attention to what's happening going forward,"" Guillaume Menuet, Citi Private Bank's head of investment strategy and economics in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told me."
113,Breaking it down: The Fed knows it needs to act decisively to keep inflation expectations from getting out of hand and to protect its credibility.
114,"In March 2021, the central bank predicted median inflation in 2022 of just 2%."
115,"Fast forward one year, and the central bank's preferred measure of tracking consumer prices put inflation at 6.6% , the highest level in 40 years."
116,"""We are late, late, late,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chairman of the Amundi Institute."
117,But getting tough right now won't be a clear fix for the problem.
118,"While raising interest rates sends an important signal, it typically takes 12 to 18 months for the impact of such a move to feed through to the economy."
119,"Plus, while hiking rates can help put a lid on hot demand, it won't do anything to tackle the supply chain issues that have been a key driver of higher prices."
120,"Meanwhile, the recovery from the pandemic is losing steam."
121,"Consumer spending is still strong, but news that the US economy shrank in the first three months of 2022 surprised economists
 Elevated energy prices pose a big risk to consumption in the coming quarters, and a slowdown of activity in Europe and China could have global ramifications."
122,"All this means that later this year, the Fed could find itself in a bind once again."
123,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell will face another conundrum: Should the central bank keep hiking interest rates to address inflation even if it tips the economy into recession, like Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s?"
124,"While Powell has expressed admiration for Volcker , both Menuet and Blanqué think it's unlikely that the Fed's current leader will channel his tactics for long."
125,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, the world has gotten very used to cheap money."
126,That — plus the Fed's delay in starting to hike — will make it harder for the central bank to stay the course.
127,"""I think it's probably going to be a case of short and sharp,"" Menuet said, referring to the Fed's tightening cycle."
128,"Watch this space: The market expects the Fed to hike rates at every meeting for the rest of the year, achieving a main interest rate of more than 3% by the end of the 2022."
129,"If the Fed decides to prioritize normalizing interest rates over potential economic fallout, that's certainly possible."
130,"But analysts at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute note that over time, interest rates have topped out at progressively lower levels."
131,"In 2006, they peaked at 5.25%, while in 2018, they only got as high as 2.5%."
132,This time?
133,"Well, that depends on how long the Fed thinks it needs to compensate for its miscalculation on inflation."
134,"EU proposes ban on Russian oil imports
 The European Union is proposing to ban all oil imports from Russia and remove the country's biggest bank, Sberbank, from the SWIFT international payments network."
135,"The latest: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday the measures would form part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, my CNN Business colleague Mark Thompson reports."
136,"""We now propose a ban on Russian oil,"" she said during a speech to the European Parliament."
137,"""Let's be clear: it will not be easy."
138,But we simply have to work on it.
139,"We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, to maximize pressure on Russia, while minimizing the impact on our own economies."""
140,"Crude oil supply would be phased out within six months, and imports of refined oil products by the end of 2022, she added."
141,"News of the proposal, which still needs the approval of all EU member states, boosted crude oil prices."
142,"Last year, Russia accounted for about 27% of EU oil imports."
143,The bloc will need to find supply elsewhere at a time when the market is already strained.
144,"Market reaction: Brent futures, the global benchmark, rose more than 4% to above $109 a barrel, while US oil futures climbed above $106.80."
145,"Oil prices have risen by about 40% since the start of the year on fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will deliver a supply shock, fueling inflation and piling pressure on European economies."
146,EU countries have already agreed to phase out Russian coal imports but the bloc has found it much harder to reach consensus on oil sanctions despite weeks of talks.
147,But it's not a done deal yet.
148,"Hungary recently reiterated its opposition to an oil embargo, and Slovakia is reportedly seeking an exemption."
149,"There are a record number of open jobs in America
 Want another sign that the Federal Reserve is in a tight spot?"
150,"Just look at the latest data on US job openings, which hit a record high in March."
151,"The United States had 11.5 million open positions that month, the highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 2000."
152,The number of Americans who quit their jobs also hit an all-time high of 4.5 million.
153,"On one hand, the data is a sign that the Federal Reserve has been effective in its aim of keeping policy loose to support the job market's recovery from the pandemic, even as it overlooked inflation."
154,"Companies are creating hundreds of thousands of jobs each month, and people who want better pay or working conditions are finding it easy to switch from one role to another."
155,"""Workers continue to quit and get hired at fast rates in today's economy,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute."
156,"""This 'churn' is a positive sign of a strengthening labor market where workers can quit, search and obtain new opportunities."""
157,But the massive number of job openings has also become part of the problem.
158,"Employers need to pay more to find the workers they need, raising their costs."
159,"They then hike prices to maintain their margins — which in turn compels workers to ask for even higher wages to cover their expenses, creating a vicious cycle known as the ""wage-price spiral"" that policymakers are desperate to avoid."

 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to raise interest rates by half of a percentage point and announce the start of reductions to its $9-trillion balance sheet as U.S. central bankers intensify efforts to bring down high inflation."
191,"Fed policy-makers have widely telegraphed a double-barrelled decision that would lift the Fed’s short-term target policy rate to a range between 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent, and set in motion a plan to trim its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by as much $95-billion a month."
192,The policy statement is due to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) following the end of the Fed’s latest two-day meeting.
193,"Markets have priced in further rate increases through this year and into next, including at least a couple more half-percentage-point hikes, as traders bet the central bank moves much more quickly than it had anticipated it would in March to get borrowing costs up to where they will start actively curbing inflation."
194,"With no fresh Fed economic or policy rate projections due until the central bank’s June meeting, most clues on how far and how fast it is prepared to go will come from Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, which starts at 2:30 p.m. EDT."
195,"The Fed began its current round of policy tightening in mid-March with a quarter-percentage-point rate hike, smaller than many policy-makers had wanted given inflation had hit a 40-year high, but calibrated so as not to inject more uncertainty into global markets roiled by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine."
196,"In the weeks since that decision, inflation has gained new steam as the war pushed up oil and food prices and China’s strict lockdowns to combat the spread of COVID-19 further disrupted supply chains."
197,"Data on the U.S. labour market also suggests increasing labour market tightness, with employment costs surging as businesses struggle to hold onto workers."
198,A record number of job openings may also translate to higher wages that could also feed through to inflation.
199,All that is ratcheting up the pressure on the Fed to act more decisively to rein things in.
200,"“Powell will continue to have a strong incentive to sound hawkish,” Piper Sandler economist Roberto Perli said this week."
201,"“The Fed’s focus these days is 100 per cent on bringing inflation down, and hawkish expectations help that cause.”
 In the run-up to this week’s meeting, Powell has said he wants to get rates “expeditiously” to what Fed policy-makers regard as a “neutral” range of 2.25 per cent-2.5 per cent, and then higher if needed."
202,Most of his colleagues appear to be on board with at least the first part of that plan.
203,"The aim would be to lift borrowing costs high enough and fast enough that households slow spending and businesses pare hiring in response, reducing inflation that is now about three times the Fed’s 2 per cent target."
204,But the central bank wants to avoid raising rates so high or so fast that it short-circuits the labour market and trips up the economy.
205,"The U.S. unemployment rate has only just dropped to 3.6 per cent, near the pre-pandemic level, and any large reversal could be a prelude to a recession."
206,"The Fed has managed “soft landings” infrequently in the past, analysts say, and at this point has allowed inflation to rise so much faster than interest rates that it may have already missed its chance to do so."
207,"And while it is expected to raise rates rather quickly now to compensate, the inflation path will also depend on a number of factors beyond the Fed’s control, including the evolution of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and ongoing supply and labour shortages connected to both."
208,The Fed’s plan to reduce its balance sheet will also be a focus on Wednesday.
209,"While the broad outlines were disclosed about three weeks ago in minutes of the Fed’s March meeting, investors expect to learn details of the speed and extent of the plan, including possible MBS sales at some point in the future."

223,"Powell said during a public appearance with the International Monetary Fund earlier this month that he believed it would be ""appropriate ... to be moving a little more quickly"" on raising rates, and that 50 basis points were ""on the table"" for May."
224,"And the Fed is also expected to use the May meeting to announce the start of quantitative tightening, or rolling assets off the central bank's $9 trillion balance sheet."
225,"Prospects of higher interest rates have stirred up volatility in equity markets, which had grown accustomed over the past two years to ultra-low interest rates and generally easy-money monetary policies."
226,"At the same time, however, many pundits have suggested the Fed allowed its pandemic-era supportive policies to run too long, allowing inflation to soar to the fastest rates since the 1980s."
227,"And after GDP growth turned negative in the U.S. in the first three months of the year, a lingering question remains whether the Fed will now be able to tighten policies without tipping the economy into a deep downturn."

 ""Because the market has priced in a 50 basis point rate hike at the Federal Reserve's May meeting, the focus will immediately shift to just how many half-point hikes the Fed expects to initiate over the balance of 2022,"" Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence, wrote in an email Tuesday."
229,"""The Fed would shock markets if it failed to deliver on more aggressive policy via a 50 basis point rate hike on Wednesday."""
230,"""The Federal Reserve's credibility is on the line, given the surge in inflation, which has proved to be anything but transitory,"" Booth added."
231,"""Interest rates are too low and markets have been way too accustomed to almost unlimited liquidity from the Fed's bond purchases."
232,"Powell's greatest folly would be to insist that the economy is very strong in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is slowing and slowing fast."""

 May 4 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a two-day policy meeting and is expected to move against surging inflation -- including possibly making its highest interest rate hike in decades."
272,The Fed last met in the middle of March when it raised rates by a quarter-point.
273,It was the first time it raised the federal funds rate since 2018 and followed two years of rate decreases and emergency actions to counter the COVID-19 pandemic.
274,"Advertisement
 At the end of its meeting Wednesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee is expected by many analysts to order a rate hike of a half-point -- which would be its largest single hike in 22 years."
275,"Many investors have said they also expect the Fed to make similar rate increases at each of its next three policy meetings -- in June, July and September."
276,"Advertisement
 The move would be the Fed's biggest punch yet against inflation, which rose over the 12 months ending in March by close to 7% -- the steepest clip since 1982."
277,"Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index -- a top indicator of inflation -- rose by 6.6% and gross domestic product -- the total output of all goods and services -- shrank unexpectedly by 1.4% when most economists expected modest growth of about 1%."
278,The Federal Reserve's target range -- the clip by which it prefers to see inflation rise on an annual basis -- is 2%.
279,The gauge in March indicated an inflationary surge at more than three times that rate.
280,"Further, high demand has outpaced what businesses are able to deliver as some employers struggling to find enough workers to operate at normal efficiency."
281,The Labor Department said on Tuesday that job openings by the end of March reached 11.5 million -- a record -- against about 6.3 million separations.
282,That means there are roughly two open positions for every unemployed adult in the United States.
283,"Advertisement
 In addition to hiking interest rates, the Fed is also expected to announce the start of a program to wind down its $9 trillion balance sheet by $95 billion per month, beginning in June."
284,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that the central bank is aiming for what economists call a ""soft landing"" as it seeks to raise interest rates to discourage spending enough to lower inflation without triggering a recession."
285,"""That's our goal,"" he said."
286,"""I don't think you'll hear anyone at the Fed say that's going to be straightforward or easy."""
287,"In order to achieve this, Fed policymakers said at the March meeting that rates would need to rise nearly 2 points this year and even more in 2023."
288,"That would require the central bank to hike rates aggressively to start and then monitor the performance of the economy and adjust the pace of increases accordingly, Powell said at the International Monetary Fund forum last month."
289,"""It is appropriate in my view to be moving a little more quickly,"" he said."
290,"""I also think there's something in the idea of a front-end loading whatever accommodation one thinks is appropriate."""
291,"Advertisement
 While most expect a half-point increase Wednesday, economists at JPMorgan say there's a 20% chance that the Fed will go for a three-quarter-point hike, but the market did not price in that possibility heading into the meeting."
292,"""It seems like they're dead set on hiking rates enough to kill inflation,"" Jim Caron, chief fixed income strategist on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said according to CNBC."
293,"""But that's the real debate."
294,"""Are they trying to get target inflation by 2024?"
295,"If they are, the wage inflation is pretty high and that will require even more tightening than the Fed is projecting."""
296,One thing seems certain -- the Fed will hike rates on Wednesday by some measure.
297,"Leaving them unchanged wouldn't do anything to address riding prices in the United States, which President Joe Biden has promised to get control of."
298,One of the primary drivers of inflation over the past year has been the rising cost of gas.
299,"AAA on Wednesday listed a national average of $4.23, which is 2 cents higher than it was Tuesday and about 10 cents higher than a week ago."
300,"Advertisement
 For a time in recent weeks, prices at the pump were going down -- the result of improving market conditions and policy actions by President Joe Biden."
301,"The ongoing war in Ukraine, and the U.S. embargo of Russian oil, and the onset of the busier summer driving season are causing prices to tick back up."
302,"Rising rates, which would make it more expensive for Americans to take out a loan or carry a balance on a credit card, also raises the interest on buying a home."
303,"Last month, Freddie Mac said that rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit an average of more than 5% -- nearly 2% above from where they were a year ago."
304,"Home purchases have slowed across the country due to rising mortgage rates, limited inventory and in anticipation of the Fed's rate hike Wednesday."
305,"As a result of the fluid market conditions, sales of existing homes have declined by close to 3%, the National Association of Realtors said according to the most recent data available."
306,"However, in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets, such as New York's Hudson Valley, realtors have reported steady sales."
307,"""In the past two months, interest rates have gone from 3.5% to 5.5%, which is a dramatic increase, and I don't see that that's affecting competition at all,"" Ryan Basten, a broker associate in Ulster County, N.Y., told The Washington Post."
308,"""If it gets to 6, 7 or 8%, then people may have a knee-jerk reaction to that, but I haven't seen it yet."""
309,"Advertisement
 Biden is scheduled to make remarks about the Fed's decision on Wednesday afternoon."
310,"He will deliver the remarks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House at 2 p.m. EDT, which is the same time the Fed's rate hike will be announced."
311,The Federal Reserve is attempting to get a handle on the worst inflation America has seen in 40 years.
312,New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is raising interest rates by a half-percentage point to get a handle on the worst inflation America has seen in 40 years.
313,It's the first time in 22 years that the central bank has hiked rates this much.
314,"In March, it ramped up its benchmark borrowing rate for the first time since late 2018, increasing it by a quarter-percentage point."
