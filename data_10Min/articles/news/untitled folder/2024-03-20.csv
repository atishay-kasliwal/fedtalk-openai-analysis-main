 Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m."

15,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two weeks ago, Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the Federal Reserve was “not far” from gaining the confidence it needed that inflation was headed sustainably toward its 2% target level, which would allow it to start cutting its benchmark interest rate."
16,"It was a tantalizing suggestion, because a cut in the Fed’s key rate has typically boosted the economy by reducing the cost of lending, from mortgages to business loans."
17,"It might also benefit President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, which is facing widespread public unhappiness over price levels across the economy."
18,"Since then, though, the latest inflation measures have turned out to be hotter than expected: A government report showed that consumer prices jumped from January to February by much more than is consistent with the Fed’s target."
19,A second report showed that wholesale inflation also came in surprisingly high — a possible sign of inflation pressures in the pipeline that could cause consumer price increases to stay elevated in the coming months.
20,A key question for Powell and the 18 other officials on the Fed’s interest-rate-setting committee is how — or whether — those figures have altered their timetable for cutting rates.
21,Powell will surely be pressed on the topic at a news conference Wednesday after the Fed ends its latest two-day meeting.
22,The central bank’s policymakers will also issue their updated quarterly projections for how they foresee the economy and interest rates changing in the months and years ahead.
23,"Their previous such projections in December showed that the officials expected to cut their benchmark rate three times this year, up from a previous forecast of two cuts."
24,"Most economists think the latest quarterly projections will again show that the policymakers expect to cut rates three times in 2024, though there’s a possibly they could reduce the expected number to two."
25,Economists generally envision the first rate cut coming in June.
26,"On Wednesday, the Fed is considered sure to keep its short-term rate, now at a 23-year high of nearly 5.4%, unchanged for a fifth straight time."
27,And it may not yet be entirely clear to Fed officials whether they have kept rates high enough for long enough to fully tame inflation.
28,"Consumer inflation, measured year over year, has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.2%."
29,Yet it’s remained stuck above 3%.
30,"And in the first two months of 2024, the costs of services such as rents, hotels and hospital stayed high, suggesting that high borrowing rates aren’t sufficiently slowing inflation in the economy’s vast service sector."
31,"While the Fed’s rate hikes typically make borrowing more expensive for homes, cars, appliances and other costly goods, they have much less effect on services spending, which doesn’t usually involve loans."
32,"With the economy still healthy, there is no compelling reason for the Fed to cut rates until it feels inflation is sustainably under control."
33,"At the same time, the central bank faces a competing concern: If it waits too long to cut rates, a long period of high borrowing costs could seriously weaken the economy and even tip it into a recession."
34,Powell warned of such an outcome when he testified to the Senate Banking Committee this month.
35,"He said the Fed was becoming more confident that inflation is continuing to slow, even if not in a straight line."
36,"“When we do get that confidence, and we’re not far from it,” he said, “it’ll be appropriate to begin” rate reductions “so that we don’t drive the economy into recession.”
 Despite widespread evidence of a sturdy economy, there are signs that it could weaken in the coming months."
37,"Americans slowed their spending at retailers in January and February, for example."
38,"The unemployment rate has reached 3.9% — still a healthy level, but up from a half-century low last year of 3.4%."
39,"And much of the hiring in recent months has occurred in government, health care and private education, with many other industries barely adding any jobs."
40,"Like the Fed, other major central banks are keeping rates high to ensure they have a firm handle on consumer price spikes."
41,"In Europe, pressure is building to lower borrowing costs as inflation drops and economic growth stalls."
42,"The European Central Bank’s leader hinted this month that a possible rate cut wouldn’t come until June, while the Bank of England isn’t expected to open the door to any imminent cut when it meets Thursday."
43,"Japan’s central bank, by contrast, is moving in the opposite direction: On Tuesday, it raised its benchmark rate for the first time in 17 years, in response to rising wages and inflation finally nearing its 2% target."
44,"The Bank of Japan was the last major central bank to lift its key rate out of negative territory, ending an unusual period that had led to negative rates in many European countries as well as in Japan."

84,The yen hit a fresh multi-month low versus the dollar on Wednesday hours before the Federal Reserve concludes a two-day policy meeting after the Bank of Japan (BOJ) the day before raised interest rates for the first time in 17 years.
85,Analysts said the yield differential between U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds remains wide and will keep pressure on the yen as it nears a multi-decade low of 151.94 hit in October 2022.
86,The dollar rose to 151.92 last November.
87,But the major central banks are largely moving in lockstep as they plan to cut interest rates to spur growth as economies slow and inflation keeps decelerating.
88,"""Nobody's expecting the BOJ to embark on a prolonged hiking cycle,"" said Bipan Rai, North America head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto."
89,"""You're still going to end up in a scenario where the rate differentials between the United States and Japan are going to look fairly wide."""
90,"The dollar was last up 0.6%
 against the yen at 151.79

91,"A potentially hawkish meeting of the Fed Open Market Committee poses downside risks to the yen, which could trigger a fresh round of measures from Japanese authorities to support it."
92,While investors expect the U.S. central bank to keep rates unchanged at its policy announcement at 2 p.m.
93,"ET (1800 GMT), the statement and comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell could be more hawkish about the timing and extent of future easing."
94,"""If the yen falls further from the current levels, I expect some verbal intervention from Japanese authorities to support the currency,"" said Athanasios Vamvakidis, global head of forex research at BofA."
95,The yen weakened and Japanese government bond yields fell after the BOJ announced on Tuesday that there would be an exit from years of ultra-easy monetary policies.
96,"""The BOJ decided for a dovish exit from its negative rates policy."
97,They raised rates but for now they are staying there.
98,"Meanwhile they will continue buying the same amount of bonds,"" BofA's Vamvakidis said."
99,"The yen's drop was broad-based, with the currency weakening to 164.71 against the euro, its lowest since 2008, while against the pound, yen slipped to 192.84, its lowest since 2015."
100,"Low Japanese rates have made the yen the funding currency of choice for carry trades, in which traders typically borrow a low-yielding currency to then sell and invest the proceeds in assets denominated in a higher-yielding one."
101,"The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, rose 0.25% to 104.100."
102,"Recent stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation reports have led traders to further reduce bets on Fed rate cuts this year, with markets now pricing in 74 basis points (bps) of easing by year end, or about half expectations at the start of 2024."
103,"The euro was down 0.25%
 at $ 1.0838
 as investors positioned ahead of the Fed meeting."
104,European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday the ECB will continue to be data dependent and will not commit to a pre-set number of rate cuts even after it starts easing its monetary policy.

108,Wall Street’s number one enemy is uncertainty and investors are feeling a lot of that right now.
109,They’re hoping that the Federal Reserve will clear things up.

114,"New York CNN —
 Wall Street’s number one enemy is uncertainty, and investors are feeling a lot of that right now."
115,They’re hoping that the Federal Reserve will clear things up Wednesday.
116,Investors are actually very certain about where interest rates will go this month (nowhere).
117,"About 99% of them think rates will remain paused at 5.25%, according to the CME FedWatch tool."
118,It’s the next few months that they’re unclear about.
119,"Investors expect to receive some clarity from the Fed’s economic forecasts, released alongside the official policy statement."
120,"The problem is that if that guidance doesn’t jibe with what they want, markets could get volatile."
121,What’s happening: The past few months have been a wild ride for Fed watchers.
122,"Economists, analysts and traders of all types kicked things off in December by predicting that policymakers would cut interest rates six times this year."
123,"Inflation rates were falling steadily at the time of those optimistic forecasts, and Fed officials seemed prepared to unsheathe their swords and cut rates."
124,That’s no longer the case.
125,Recent hawkish commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell coupled with a string of higher-than-expected inflation reports have tempered Wall Street’s dreams of lower interest rates.
126,Predictions for the first rate cut in two years were pushed back to May and then to June.
127,"Now, there’s about an even split over whether June or July will be the month."
128,Uncertainty prevails.
129,"“Inflation has been firmer in recent months, but we think it is still on track to fall enough by the June FOMC meeting for a first cut,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note this week."
130,"“This has become less obvious though, and our inflation path for the rest of the year is now in a range where small surprises could have large consequences.”
 Goldman analysts also lowered their estimate to three rate cuts this year (they revised it from five to four in late February)."
131,"How the Fed can help: Enter the Fed’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which contains what’s colloquially known as the dot plot."
132,"If the Fed has shifted its thinking about when it will lower interest rates, it will come through in this chart, which shows (in a series of dots) where each of the central bank’s 19 officials expect interest rates to go in the future."
133,Investors pay close attention to these forecasts for information about the path of rate hikes.
134,"When there’s a shift in the plot, it tells investors that the Fed could plan a change in how it is approaching rates."
135,"The official policy statement from the Federal Reserve represents a consensus among the voting policy members, but this extra data allows investors to look under the hood and see what’s going on behind the scenes."
136,"That’s important because if just two Fed officials turn slightly more hawkish, “the forecast for three rate cuts in 2024 would shrink to two, upsetting this timetable and markets at the same time,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, in a note this week."
137,The plot also often underscores the difference between what investors think will happen and what the Fed thinks will happen.
138,"So if the Fed projects fewer rate hikes ahead, that will likely send bond yields higher and markets lower."
139,"Wednesday’s dot plot, warned Kelly, could spell “danger” for markets."
140,"Chipotle’s stock is so hot, the company’s board approved a 50-for-1 stock split
 Chipotle’s board announced that it approved a 50-for-1 stock split on Tuesday, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya."
141,The company called it one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.
142,"That means a single share of Chipotle, worth $2,797.56 as of Tuesday’s stock market close, will be split into 50 smaller shares if the move wins shareholder approval, effectively rolling back the cost of investing in the company."
143,Companies often decide to split their stocks when they believe the price per share is too high for average investors.
144,"In a statement, Chipotle’s chief financial officer, Jack Hartung, said the split would make the stock more “accessible.”
 “This is the first stock split in Chipotle’s 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors,” said Hartung."
145,"The split is not yet a done deal, though."
146,The company will put the stock split decision up for a shareholder vote on June 6.
147,"If it is approved, Chipotle’s cheaper, post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 26."
148,Investors seemed to cheer on the potential split — Chipotle’s stock rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.
149,The announcement comes at a time when Chipotle’s shares are trading at all-time highs.
150,"Ben & Jerry’s and Magnum will form the core of an $8 billion ice cream company
 The world’s biggest ice cream business is about to go it alone, reports CNN’s Hanna Ziady."
151,"Unilever announced Tuesday that it plans to spin off its ice cream unit as part of a drive to boost sales and profitability, which will also entail cutting around 6% of the workforce."
152,"After a century-long endeavor, Unilever now dominates the global ice cream market, with its brands sold around the world."
153,"“Following separation, Unilever will become a simpler, more focused company,” it said in a statement."
154,"The newly minted firm will boast five of the 10 best-selling ice cream brands worldwide, namely Magnum, Ben & Jerry’s, Breyers, Walls and Cornetto."
155,Sales of these and Unilever’s other ice cream brands together amounted to €7.9 billion ($8.6 billion) last year.
156,"“The future growth of Unilever and ice cream is best served by separating the business,” Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher told journalists."
157,"He pointed to ice cream’s “distinct characteristics,” such as season-dependent demand and a supply chain that must be able to support frozen goods."
158,"Under the growth plan unveiled in October, the UK-based company “committed to do fewer things better and with greater impact,” Schumacher added in the statement."
159,"“The changes we are announcing today will help us accelerate that plan.”
 
 
 The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday for the fifth consecutive meeting, as the central bank awaits more data to determine when to cut rates."
160,"Washington, DC CNN —
 The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday for the fifth consecutive meeting, as the central bank awaits more data to determine when to cut rates."
161,The Fed has raised rates aggressively over the past two years in a bid to fight the highest inflation in decades.
162,"But while Americans continue to deal with high interest rates and inflation, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is still not ready to lower borrowing costs just yet."
163,Wall Street is betting that the first rate cut will come in the summer.
164,Fed officials are facing the difficult task of balancing the risk of cutting too soon with the risk of cutting too late — both of which come with consequences.
165,"That’s why the timing of that first rate cut is so critical, because it could either undo the progress the Fed has seen, if officials cut too soon, or it could fail to prevent the economy from sharply deteriorating, if officials cut too late."
166,Fed officials also released a fresh set of economic projections Wednesday.
167,They show that central bank officials now expect fewer rate cuts in the coming years than they estimated in December.
168,"A majority of Fed policymakers continue to expect three rate cuts this year, but they now see fewer in 2025 and 2026."
169,They expect interest rates in the longer run to be slightly higher than they projected in December.
170,Economic growth is also expected to be much higher this year than officials estimated.
171,"Officials also reflected in their latest estimates that they expect “core” inflation, a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices, to be higher this year than previously thought."
172,"US stocks broadly soared to new highs Wednesday, with the S&P 500 topping the 5,200 level for the first time ever, closing 0.9% higher."
173,"The blue-chip Dow also reached a new record, up 401 points, or 1%, at 39,511.34; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit 16,369.41, also a new high."
174,Here are some key takeways from the Fed’s latest decision.
175,"It’s too soon to know if inflation has stalled
 Powell said “we continue to make good progress in bringing inflation down,” but it has become evident there are some persistent price pressures in housing and the services sector."
176,That could be worrisome for the Fed as it faces the final stretch of its historic inflation fight.
177,"Rising shelter costs and a sharp climb in gas prices pushed up consumer prices in February, according to the latest Consumer Price Index."
178,The Fed chief repeated his usual phrase that inflation’s journey back down to 2% will be a bumpy one.
179,"“We’ve got nine months of 2.5% inflation, now we’ve had two months of kind of bumpy inflation,” Powell said Wednesday in a post-meeting press conference."
180,"“Now, there were some bumps and the question is, are they more than bumps?"
181,"And we can’t know that, that’s why we are approaching this question carefully.”
 Economists like to look at data over several months to strip out any “noise,” or month-to-month fluctuations, and make sense of any durable trends."
182,That’s how the Fed is approaching the current situation with inflation; waiting for more data to know if inflation has indeed stalled.
183,Powell added there might have also been some “seasonal effects” that skewed data for January.
184,"Asked about the role of rising shelter costs in pushing up inflation, Powell said there is “some confidence that the lower market rents we’re seeing will show up over time, but there’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen.”
 The Fed is in wait-and-see mode
 Chair Powell laid out the risks of cutting too soon versus cutting too late, explaining that the Fed is still in wait-and-see mode because there simply isn’t any urgency to cut rates."
185,"“It is consequential,” Powell said."
186,"“Fortunately, with the economy growing, with the labor market strong and inflation coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.”
 Powell said officials want to “feel more confident” inflation is headed toward the central bank’s 2% target."
187,Wednesday’s policy statement also made that clear.
188,"“The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target
 range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” it said."
189,America’s economy remains solid by many measures and in Powell’s own view.
190,"“The economy is strong, the labor market is strong and inflation has come way down,” he said."
191,"Economic growth in the first quarter is expected to register at a healthy 2.1% annualized rate, according to the Atlanta Fed’s latest projection, following two straight quarters of growth above a robust 3%."
192,"The job market is still humming along, with employers continuing to add jobs at a brisk pace while unemployment remains low."
193,"The jobless rate edged higher in February, to 3.9% from 3.7%, but it has remained below 4% for more than two years."
194,"Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, recently told CNN that “it doesn’t look like the economy is anywhere close to a recession.”
 If the job market does weaken more than expected in the coming months, that could change the path of monetary policy."
195,"“If you look historically, we’re high."
196,"And the longer we stay at that — if inflation continues falling — we’re going to have to start thinking about the employment side of the mandate,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC earlier this month."
197,It’s also possible that the US economy’s persistent strength could be standing in the way of any further improvement on the inflation front.
198,"Officials also consider the role of productivity when assessing growth, which boomed last year."
199,"Consumer spending also remains healthy, but it has cooled down from the red-hot pace in the summer."
200,"Spending fell sharply in January, mostly due to the unseasonably cold weather, but the Commerce Department’s latest report on retail spending showed that there was a rebound in February."
201,Broader figures on consumer spending in February are due later this month.
202,The soft landing that once looked nearly impossible for the Federal Reserve to pull off is still on track.
203,"That’s the message from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs."
204,"New York CNN —
 The soft landing that once looked nearly impossible for the Federal Reserve to pull off is still on track."
205,"That’s the message from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs."
206,"“Certainly, it doesn’t look like the economy is anywhere close to a recession,” Hatzius told CNN."
207,"Even though he concedes inflation has come in hotter-than-expected so far this year, the Goldman economist is sticking by his prescient call for a soft landing."
208,"“If I look at the news flow overall over the last year, it’s still very, very positive,” Hatzius said."
209,“Inflation has come down very substantially over that period.
210,"And more importantly, it’s come down without significant weakness in activity."
211,We haven’t seen a recession.
212,"We haven’t been close to a recession.”
 To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve spiked interest rates in 2022 and 2023 at the fastest pace since the 1980s under legendary Fed chief Paul Volcker."
213,Many feared that war on inflation would cause unemployment to surge and short-circuit the economic recovery from Covid-19.
214,"At one point in the fall of 2022, a model by Bloomberg projected a 100% risk of a US recession over the following 12 months."
215,"Now, many economists are in the soft landing camp as consumer spending and the jobs market have proven to be much more resilient than anticipated."
216,"Hatzius told CNN he’s “pretty confident” there won’t be a US recession over the next 12 months, placing just a 15% risk of a downturn."
217,That’s more or less the average recession risk on any given year.
218,That upbeat forecast should be a relief to those in the White House trying to sell voters on President Joe Biden’s economic message.
219,A recession could doom that effort.
220,"Since 1900, all five president running for reelection who had a recession in the year they ran for reelection lost, according to TD Cowen Washington Research Group."
221,"(Those five presidents were William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W."
222,Bush and Donald Trump.)
223,"What could accelerate rate cuts
 Hatzius told CNN that inflation will likely have cooled enough by June to pave the way for the Fed to start cutting interest rates."
224,That would help ease high borrowing costs on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
225,"“Our forecast and current market expectation is that the first cut comes in June, but it’s going to be data dependent,” Hatzius said."
226,The Fed could speed up interest rate cuts if the historically-strong jobs market starts to weaken.
227,"“If we were to see more pervasive signs of labor market deterioration, I’d say it becomes more urgent to move,” Hatzius said."
228,"Even as hiring has remained sturdy, the unemployment rate climbed to 3.9% in February, up from the historic low of 3.5% as recently as July 2023."
229,"Hatzius said that if the unemployment rate moves into the low-4% range, that would make officials inside the Fed nervous enough to start pulling forward their rate cut plans."
230,"Unknown unknowns
 Even though recession risks have eased, there are always wildcards that could change the picture quickly."
231,"“Almost by definition, I think shocks are negative."
232,Now what am I worried about?
233,"Geopolitics would certainly be high up on the list,” Hatzius said."
234,"“We live in a much more unstable world with military conflict, the war in Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, more tensions between the US and China.”
 And then there are the unknown unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld famously phrased."
235,"“The shock that occurred four years ago was kind of the most extreme version of an unknown, unknown that we have seen in many decades, if not ever,” Hatzius said, referring to Covid."
236,"Empty office buildings
 One risk that is casting a shadow over the economy is empty office buildings in the $20 trillion commercial real estate market — a problem caused in part by Covid and the rise of remote work."
237,"Yet Hatzius, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, doesn’t think empty office buildings will sink the US economy the way toxic mortgages did in 2008."
238,He pointed to the fact that office construction is a relatively small part of the economy and the fact that this problem is expected to play out over several years.
239,"“It’s hard to see how that would cause a recession,” Hatzius said."

 U.S. Federal Reserve officials signaled Wednesday that they still expect to cut their key interest rate three times in 2024, fueling a rally on Wall Street, despite signs that inflation remained elevated at the start of the year."
241,"For now, the officials kept their benchmark rate unchanged for a fifth straight time."
242,"Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said the surprising pickup in inflation in January and February hadn’t fundamentally changed the Fed’s picture of the economy: The central bank still expects inflation to continue to cool, though more gradually than it thought three months ago."
243,The recent high inflation readings followed six months of steady slowdowns in price increases.
244,Economists and Wall Street investors were looking for some clarification Wednesday about how the latest inflation reports were viewed at the Fed.
245,"The January and February data, Powell said, “haven’t really changed the overall story, which is that of inflation moving down gradually on a sometimes bumpy road towards 2%,” the Fed’s target."
246,"In new quarterly projections they issued, the policymakers forecast that stronger growth and inflation above their 2% target level would persist into next year."
247,"Overall, the forecasts suggest that the Fed still expects an unusual combination: A healthy job market and economy in tandem with inflation that continues to cool — just more gradually than they had predicted three months ago."
248,"For this year, the Fed projected that the economy will expand 2.1% — a big increase from its December forecast of just 1.4%."
249,"Yet at the same time, it still expects inflation to keep declining, though slowly."
250,"Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, said the Fed’s updated projections suggest that it expects improvements in supply chains and the availability of workers to continue, allowing the economy to grow even as inflation slows to the Fed’s target."
251,"Rising immigration, for example, has made it easier for businesses to hire without having to rapidly raise pay."
252,"“It looks to me like they’re embracing that supply-side story,” Gapen said."
253,"That means “you can cut while growth is solid, and you can cut while the labor market is strong.”
 Rate cuts would, over time, lead to lower costs for home and auto loans, credit card borrowing and business loans."
254,"They might also aid President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, which is facing widespread public unhappiness over higher prices and could benefit from an economic jolt stemming from lower borrowing rates."
255,"The financial markets cheered the message Wednesday from Powell and the Fed, with traders sending the Dow Jones industrial average surging 1%, to another all-time high."
256,"“Inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably,” Powell said."
257,"“It is still likely ... that we will see that confidence and that there will be rate cuts.”
 The Fed’s policymakers did make some small adjustments in their outlook: Their projections showed that in 2025, they now foresee only three rate cuts, down from the four they envisioned in their December forecasts."
258,"One reason may be that they expect “core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, to still be 2.6% by the end of 2024, up from their previous projection of 2.4%."
259,"In January, core inflation was 2.8%, according to the Fed’s preferred measure."
260,"The Fed’s foecasts overall, suggest that
 Most economists have pegged the Fed’s June meeting as the most likely time for it to announce its first rate cut, which would begin to reverse the 11 hikes it imposed beginning two years ago."
261,The Fed’s hikes have helped lower annual inflation from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.2%.
262,But they have also made borrowing much costlier for businesses and households.
263,"Though consumer inflation has tumbled since mid-2022, it has remained stuck above 3%."
264,"And in the first two months of 2024, the cost of services, like rents, hotels and hospital stays, remained elevated."
265,That suggested that high borrowing rates weren’t sufficiently slowing inflation in the economy’s vast service sector.
266,"While the Fed’s rate hikes typically make borrowing more expensive for homes, cars, appliances and other costly goods, they have much less effect on services spending, which doesn’t usually involve loans."
267,"With the economy still healthy, there is no compelling reason for the Fed to cut rates until it feels inflation is sustainably under control."
268,"“There’s no urgency for them,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, a wealth management company."
269,"“They’ve got a strong economy, strong labor market.”
 In most respects, the U.S. economy remains heathy."
270,"Employers keep hiring, unemployment remains low, and the stock market is hovering at record highs."
271,Yet average consumer prices remain much higher than they were before the pandemic — a source of unhappiness for many Americans for which Republicans have sought to pin blame on Biden.
272,And there are signs that the economy could weaken in the coming months.
273,"Americans slowed their spending at retailers in January and February, for example."
274,"The unemployment rate has reached 3.9% — still a healthy level, but up from a half-century low last year of 3.4%."
275,"And much of the hiring in recent months has occurred in government, health care and private education, with many other industries barely adding any jobs."
276,Other major central banks are also keeping rates high to ensure that they have a firm handle on consumer price spikes.
277,"In Europe, pressure is building to lower borrowing costs as inflation drops and economic growth stalls."
278,"The European Central Bank’s leader hinted this month that a possible rate cut could come in June, while the Bank of England isn’t expected to open the door to any imminent cut when it meets Thursday."
