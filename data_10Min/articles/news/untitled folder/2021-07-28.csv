22,Some experts think central bank digital money is inevitable—and the US is falling behind.
23,Digital money is nothing new—debit and credit cards have been with us for years.
24,What’s changed is its pervasiveness.
25,"With fewer people carrying paper money, and with some places no longer accepting it, we’ve become ever more reliant on electronic cash provided by commercial institutions, from PayPal to Visa."
26,"As physical cash goes away, so do the properties that make it special."
27,"Cash allows people to transact without a bank account, without fees, and without a middle man in the way of their access to currency issued directly by the central bank, the lender of last resort and the bedrock of the financial system."
28,Is it time for America’s central bank to create a digital dollar?
29,Congress is asking.
30,"And in hearings on July 27, a group of experts laid out their reasons why the Federal Reserve needs to go digital."
31,Here are a few of their arguments.
32,"Payments are expensive
 Andrew Levin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and a 20-year veteran of the Federal Reserve, highlighted examples of businesses in New England that pay 3% or even more to the likes of Square, PayPal, and Visa whenever a customer makes a digital transaction."
33,"He points out that small businesses typically get by on tight margins, and high payment costs could make the difference between between surviving and going under."
34,"He notes that physical money isn’t free either, as businesses have to pay for security and cash management, which can cost as much as the electronic services."
35,"Levin suggests that a central bank digital currency, by contrast, could be designed to be costless or at least lower cost, which could promote job creation."
36,"A digital dollar could be a new tool for monetary policy
 The Fed has already pushed interest rates about as low as they can go, meaning policy makers have less scope to rev up the economy than they used to."
37,"A digital currency would let the central bank deposit money directly into accounts held by general public (so-called “helicopter money”), as Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said in her testimony."
38,"This could be faster, cheaper, and better targeted than the paper stimulus checks issued by the US government during the pandemic."
39,(Digital money also could also come with an expiration date to encourage spending.)
40,"China is already far along in developing a digital currency
 China is among the furthest along in piloting a digital currency, giving the world’s second-largest economy the opportunity to be the leader and standard-setter for this critical digital infrastructure."
41,"Yaya Fanusie, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, noted that China plays an influential role at the Bank for International Settlements, which is set to lead deliberations over central bank digital currency standards."
42,Those standards could end up benefitting China’s goals and interests instead of the US’s.
43,"“The United States will need to increase its CBDC expertise and assert greater influence in the BIS and other international forums that guide CBDC development,” Fanusie testified."
44,"It’s the Federal Reserve or Facebook
 If central banks don’t upgrade their payment systems, multinational companies like Facebook (whose initial digital coin effort was greeted by governments with a barrage of concerns) and Amazon could pull ahead and disintermediate the government authorities."
45,"“In a scenario where one or two Big Tech firms succeeded in dominating the entire US payments system, policymakers would face a regulatory nightmare in seeking to preserve consumer privacy and equitable treatment of small businesses,” Dartmouth’s Levin wrote."
46,"A digital currency would support the dollar’s role globally
 The US dollar is the main currency for international transactions, giving the American government outsize influence in global affairs through the use of sanctions."
47,"If central bank digital currencies prove to be more efficient than the existing, dollar-heavy correspondent banking system, that could gradually undermine the dollar’s role in international payments, noted Julia Friedlander, senior fellow and deputy director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center."
48,"“The use of CBDCs as a payments technology could begin to cause cracks in the dollar’s ubiquity in international transactions,” Friedlander testified."
49,"Central bank digital currencies still have risks
 Despite the advantages, a central bank digital currency also has some serious risks for the economy and the financial system."
50,"If regular people can create accounts directly with the central bank, that could undermine the existing commercial banking system."
51,"Depending on how the electronic money is designed, it could be exploited by money launderers and hackers."
52,"If the government fails to protect the system from outages and cyber attacks, people could lose confidence in the lender of last resort."
53,"Even so, a number of experts think central bank digital money has promise, and is likely inevitable."
54,"“The US strength in the international payments and financial services space is an American treasure that has tremendously benefited the country,” wrote Robert Baldwin, head of policy at the Association for Digital Asset Markets, in his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee."
55,"“The US must continue to innovate in this space so that it does not fall behind to pressure from international competition and digitization.”

61,The rest of Asian markets rose Thursday while Hong Kong was lifted after China sought to reassure investors over its latest regulatory crackdown.
62,"Traders were also cheered by progress in Washington on President Joe Biden’s trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, which he has said could “transform America” and add to the monumental amounts of stimulus already pumped into the world’s top economy."
63,The developments overshadowed concerns about the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant that is sending infection rates spiking in several countries—including those with high vaccination rates—and forcing some governments to impose lockdowns or other containment measures.
64,"While the Fed news was met with a shrug on Wall Street, Asia enjoyed gains, having endured a volatile week."
65,"Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Mumbai, Wellington, Taipei, Bangkok and Jakarta all rose."
66,"But Hong Kong was the standout, piling on more than three percent, extending Wednesday’s 1.5 percent rally."
67,"However, it was still way off clawing back recent losses as it had dropped more than nine percent from Thursday’s close to Tuesday’s finish.Shanghai climbed more than one percent."
68,"After a closely watched meeting, the Fed said the pandemic recovery was progressing well but it was still too early to take away the ultra-loose policies that have helped nurse the economy back to health."
69,The central bank has said it will maintain its massive bond-buying and record low interest rate scheme for as long as it takes to tame unemployment and keep inflation running hot for an extended period.
70,"It said the worst-hit sectors “have shown improvement but have not fully recovered” and cautioned that “risks to the economic outlook remain.” Referring to a time when the Fed can begin tapering, boss Jerome Powell told reporters: “We’re not there."
71,"And we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there.” However, he said policymakers had taken a “first deep dive” on how to begin winding the bond-buying down but no decision had been made."
72,"Observers said that with no meeting set for August, the bank was unlikely to move until the back end of the year.“The lack of substantial policy change by the Federal Reserve in its latest... meeting was largely expected,” said JP Morgan Asset Management strategist Tai Hui."
73,"“What is noteworthy is that the Fed considers that the US economy ‘has made progress’ towards its goals—a strong hint it could start to taper its asset purchases as soon as December.”

82,"""If we're wrong, it could shorten the economic cycle that we're in."""
83,"In other words, the Fed would need to cool inflation off by swiftly raising interest rates."

 The Federal Reserve will conclude its latest policy meeting on Wednesday weighing the risks of a COVID-19 resurgence in the United States and a potentially slower economic recovery against a developing inflation threat that had been its main focus."
531,"* Fed to release policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT)
 * Officials expected to continue bond-buying taper debate
 * Fed’s Powell scheduled to hold news briefing
 WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will conclude its latest policy meeting on Wednesday weighing the risks of a COVID-19 resurgence in the United States and a potentially slower economic recovery against a developing inflation threat that had been its main focus."
532,"Fed officials are expected to continue their debate over when to wean the economy from the measures put in place more than a year ago to fight the pandemic’s economic aftershock, and in particular to discuss when to reduce the $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities the U.S. central bank is buying each month to hold down long-term interest rates."
533,"But that discussion, begun in earnest just six weeks ago when U.S. cases of COVID-19 were falling under the influence of vaccinations, has been complicated by the rapid spread of the more infectious Delta variant of the virus, the renewal of crisis conditions in some hospitals, and reinstated mask mandates in some cities."
534,"Though focused mostly on the 40% of the adult U.S. population that remains unvaccinated, the current outbreak nevertheless raises fresh tensions for the Fed over whether planning to fend off inflation should be the top concern at a time when the health crisis may yet curb an otherwise ebullient recovery."
535,"“Sadly, (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell will have to acknowledge the downside risks that are beginning to emerge,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote ahead of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting this week."
536,“The question mark is how spread of the Delta variant affects the return to work and whether it dampens some of the demand for services” that had begun to lead the recovery and pull millions of sidelined people back into jobs.
537,"The economy still is 6.8 million jobs short of where it was before the pandemic’s onset in early 2020, and Powell has said the country remains “a ways off” from the progress he wants to see before changing any of the Fed’s efforts at encouraging job growth."
538,Powell will hold a news conference following the 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) release of the Fed’s latest policy statement.
539,"INFECTIONS AND INFLATION
 The Fed remains in full crisis-fighting mode more than 16 months into a national state of emergency, continuing to hold its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and buying bonds at a pace some policymakers have begun to question openly as too aggressive."
540,"Inflation is taking off, they note, and housing prices have hit record highs thanks in part to the relatively low interest rates on home mortgages."
541,"To avoid bigger problems down the road the Fed should pull back “sooner rather than later,” Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said after the June 15-16 policy meeting."
542,St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has voiced similar sentiments - only to see Missouri’s second-biggest city reimpose an indoor mask mandate amid a rapid coronavirus outbreak in the state.
543,"Nationally, daily infections have risen about fourfold since the Fed met in June, making what had seemed a straightforward process - a turn from fighting recession to managing the rising prices and other risks of a strong recovery - into a more nuanced debate over how to continue planning for the pandemic’s end while also acknowledging its persistence."
544,"A new Reuters poll showed 160 of 202 economists, or about 80%, said the spread of new coronavirus variants was the biggest risk to the recovery."
545,The latest surge in cases has not shown up clearly yet in the economic data.
546,Consumer confidence remains high and people are still boarding planes and heading to restaurants.
547,"Still, Bank of America analysts recently drew a cautionary tale from Michigan, where a wave of infections in February appeared to dent hiring and consumer spending."
548,"“So far we have seen little evidence of the Delta variant significantly affecting economic activity or spending on services,” those analysts wrote."
549,"But “we have good reason to be concerned about the current outbreak and what it means.”
 TAPER TALK CONTINUES
 Amid those risks, there’s also no guarantee that inflation will fade on a timetable within the Fed’s comfort zone - possibly leaving the central caught between slower growth and rising prices, the worst of both worlds."
550,A new Fed framework ostensibly allows inflation to run above the central bank’s formal 2% target to give the economy more room to generate jobs.
551,"That approach, however, was designed after a decade of low inflation, and on an expectation the chief challenge would be raising the weak pace of price increases."
552,"Yet as of May, with the world economy beset by supply-chain problems and other challenges tied to the economic reopening, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure was nearly twice the target rate."
553,"If that trend continues “they would have to say at some point ‘we do have to remove accommodation’ ... and they could not wait for maximum employment” before raising interest rates, as their current policy pledges to do, said Bill English, a Yale School of Management professor and former head of the Fed’s monetary affairs division."
554,"For that reason alone, Fed planning over how to reduce its bond-buying program is expected to continue."
555,"The central bank wants the monthly purchases to end before considering an interest rate increase, and the process of tapering them could take perhaps a year to complete - a lengthy runway if inflation persists and rate increases become more urgent."
556,"Officials have also promised ample advance notice before actually making any change, adding more months to the timetable."
557,"So far, officials are not foreclosing any option."
558,"Market analysts say they expect the Fed to clarify its plans for ending the bond-buying in the fall, and perhaps begin reducing purchases early next year."
559,"That presumes U.S. hiring continues, and that travel, dining out, and other close-contact social activities also recover."
560,"In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its forecast for U.S. growth in 2021 to a torrid 7%."
561,"But in a related blog, Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, cautioned central banks not to be distracted into “prematurely tightening policies” by a rise in inflation that was expected to fade on its own."
562,"“The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back globally,” she wrote."
563,Federal Reserve officials are set to resume deliberations Wednesday about how and when to begin paring their asset purchases amid an economic rebound clouded by supply-chain bottlenecks and rising Covid-19 cases.

619,"We have cut our exposure since the beginning of the year, going from very overweight to somewhat underweight,” said Nicholas McConway, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Amundi."
620,Invesco’s Golden Dragon China ETF has lost almost 50% since February.
621,"But, this phase of market correction will create interesting investment opportunities in the longer term as valuations become more compelling and as the market becomes more comfortable with the Chinese regulatory regime, McConway said."
622,"The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lowered its outlook for developing economies, citing their difficulties in accessing COVID-19 vaccines and lesser fiscal support than in advanced economies."
623,It reduced its 2021 forecast for China by 0.3 percentage point.

 Federal Reserve officials conclude a two-day meeting in Washington on Wednesday."
633,The focus will be on laying the groundwork for less supportive policy.
634,Federal Reserve officials conclude a two-day meeting in Washington on Wednesday.
635,The focus will be on laying the groundwork for less supportive policy.
636,Central bankers have been clear that tapering off bond purchases is the first step toward moving policy away from an emergency setting.
637,Increases in the funds rate remain off in the distant future.
638,"Bond-buying is just one of the Fed’s policy tools, and is used to lower longer-term interest rates and to get money chugging around the economy."
639,"The Fed also sets a policy interest rate, the federal funds rate , to keep borrowing costs low."
640,It has been near zero since March 2020.
641,"The Fed is moving cautiously, and for a reason: Back in 2013, markets convulsed when investors realized that a similar bond-buying program after the financial crisis would slow soon."
642,Mr. Powell and crew do not want to stage a rerun.
643,There’s a hot debate among policymakers about how that taper should play out.
644,Some officials think the Fed should slow mortgage debt buying first because the housing market is booming.
645,Others have said mortgage security buying has little special effect on the housing market.
646,They have hinted or said they would favor tapering both types of purchases at the same speed.
647,"Economists mostly expect the central bank to announce plans to slow those purchases this year, perhaps as soon as August, before actually dialing them back late this year or early next."
648,"That slowdown is what Wall Street refers to as a “taper.”
 The Fed is buying $120 billion in government backed bonds each month — $80 billion in Treasury debt and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities."
649,"Here are a few key things to know about the bond-buying, and key details that Wall Street will be watching:
 The Federal Reserve has swollen its balance sheet by buying bonds to bolster the economy during the pandemic, making it a bigger player in markets."
650,Big and often conflicting considerations loom over the taper debate.
651,Inflation has picked up more sharply than many Fed officials expected.
652,"Those price pressures are expected to fade, but the risk that they will linger is a source of discomfort, ramping up the urgency to create some sort of exit plan."
653,"At the same time, the job market is far from healed, and the surging Delta coronavirus variant means that the pandemic remains a real risk."
654,Policy missteps could prove costly.
655,"That’s because Fed policymakers are debating their plans for future “tapering,” the widely used term for slowing down monthly purchases of government-backed debt."
656,"The bond purchases are meant to keep money chugging through the economy by encouraging lending and spending, and slowing them would be the first step in moving policy toward a more normal setting."
657,"Economists expect the central bank’s postmeeting statement at 2 p.m. Wednesday to leave policy unchanged, but investors will keenly watch a subsequent news conference with the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for any hints at when — and how — officials might begin to pull back their economic support."
658,"Federal Reserve officials are gathering in Washington this week with monetary policy still set to emergency mode, even as the economy rebounds and inflation accelerates."
659,"The Federal Reserve is debating when and how to slow its huge bond purchases, the first step in moving away from its emergency stance as the economy rebounds from the pandemic."
660,"As it does, the hole that the coronavirus blew through the labor market looms large."
661,The reasons to withdraw support soon are obvious.
662,"Growth is coming in strong, bolstered by vast government spending."
663,"Inflation has heated up, and while that is expected to be a temporary situation, the increase in prices is surprisingly strong."
664,But the jobs situation is another story.
665,About 6.8 million jobs are missing from employer payrolls compared with February 2020.
666,The central bank has every reason to expect the economy to continue healing once it slows (or even stops) the bond buying.
667,"Asset prices may fall a little bit, and longer-term interest rates might rise slightly, but the Fed’s policy rate is still set at rock bottom, which should keep borrowing costs relatively low."
668,Government spending continues to trickle out into the economy.
669,"Many consumers are flush with savings, and eagerly spending them."
670,"The key for Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and his colleagues is to avoid tanking the economy by surprising investors and causing markets to gyrate, credit to dry up and growth to pull back more abruptly than planned."
671,The state of the job market is a particularly good reason to proceed carefully.
672,"If the Fed accidentally sends an overly aggressive signal to markets, causing financial conditions to become too restrictive when millions are still in need of new positions, it could make for a long road back to full employment."
673,"The risk looms especially large as a coronavirus variant causes cases to surge in many countries, including the United States."
674,"While it is still unclear how much of a hurdle the Delta variant poses to growth, it has underlined that the pandemic is a persistent threat."
675,"For now, the Fed is being careful to broadcast every incremental step as it debates when and how to begin tiptoeing away from its policy support, something it wants to do only after the economy has made “substantial” further progress."
676,The idea is that a constant drip of communication will prevent any market-rocking surprises.
677,"And the central bank has set out an even more ambitious, and more patient, goal when it comes to interest rates."
678,"Barring some big surprise in which financial risks or inflation bubble up dangerously, officials want to see the job market return to maximum employment before lifting borrowing costs."
679,"“They’d like to wait,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics."
680,She explained that officials were weighing the need to keep longer-run inflation under wraps against the many jobs still missing — and hoping that price pressures proved short-lived.
681,"“They’re banking on the T-word,” Ms. Bostjancic said."
682,“Transient.” Yet when that “full employment” goal will be met is a major unknown.
683,"Many workers have retired since the start of the pandemic, and it is not clear whether they will return to work even if opportunities are plentiful."
684,"But the participation rate for prime-age workers — the share of people between the ages of 25 and 54 who are working or actively looking for jobs — has fallen precipitously since last year, and Fed officials are hoping to see that figure recover."
685,Lingering child care issues and pandemic nervousness may be keeping would-be workers at home.
686,The Fed is trying to wait and see what the job market can do.
687,"“It would be a mistake to act prematurely,” Mr. Powell told lawmakers recently."
688,"“At a certain point the risks may flip, but right now the risks to me are clear.”
