2,Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shares led the semiconductor sector higher on Wednesday as investors awaited the latest interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve.
3,Nvidia (NVDA) gained more than 2.5% as a number of Wall Street analysts praised the company's announcements at its GTC developer conference.
4,"Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who reiterated the firm's buy rating and raised the per-share price target to $310 from $275 on Nvidia (NVDA), said the keynote address, given by CEO Jensen Huang, ""fundamentally"" widened the company's competitive moat and expanded its opportunity to the ""multi-trillion"" IT and infrastructure as a service industry, from just being only focused on chips."
5,"Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis, who has an overweight rating on Nvidia (NVDA), said the keynote showed the company is the ""king"" of generative AI."
6,"""Clearly expectation were very high going into GTC, but this is the biggest secular tailwind in Tech and NVDA remains well ahead of the competition,"" Curtis wrote in an investor note."
7,"AMD (AMD), which competes with Nvidia (NVDA), saw its shares rise more than 3% at mid-day."
8,Broadcom (AVGO) shares rose fractionally even as the U.K.'s competition regulator said the company's pending deal for VMware (VMW) could make servers more expensive.
9,"""We are concerned this deal could allow Broadcom to cut out competitors from the supply of hardware components to the server market and lead to less innovation at a time when most firms want fast, responsive, and affordable IT systems,"" David Stewart, Executive Director at the CMA, said in a statement."
10,"A Broadcom (AVGO) spokesperson told Seeking Alpha the company is ""working constructively"" with the CMA on the matter."
11,Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares rose fractionally even as Citi lowered estimates ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter results next week.
12,"""While we expect another lowering of estimates, our reasons to be positive on MU remain unchanged – we believe capex and utilization cuts by Micron and Hynix should create a bottom to the DRAM market over the next six months, and MU is trading close to a trough valuation,"" analyst Christopher Danely wrote in an investor note."
13,"Semtech (SMTC) shares rose more than 6% following an upgrade from investment firm B. Riley, citing the potential for ""acceleration"" next year and the recent acquisition of Sierra Wireless."
14,Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares fell fractionally as the company reportedly expects to complete its purchase of Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) in the first-half of the year.
15,"On Tuesday, Intel (INTC) unveiled several executive changes, including appointing Stuart Pann as senior vice president and general manager of the company's foundry business."
16,"Other chip makers were mixed on Wednesday, including modest gains for Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR)."
17,"Conversely, Qualcomm (QCOM), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) saw fractional losses."
18,"Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly increased its order for AI-linked chips via Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) due to high demand."
19,The Federal Reserve will announce its decision on interest rates Wednesday afternoon.
20,Markets anticipate the central bank will enact a 25 basis point rate hike.
21,Economists said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will have a tricky job this afternoon: balancing the continued need to bat down inflation with rising concerns of instability in banks.
22,"""The Fed still has work to do, and their actions and communications are going to come under increasing scrutiny given the events of the past few days,"" said Vanguard senior economist Andrew Patterson."
23,"""They need to be careful in balancing the risks of price and financial stability."""
24,"Joseph Davis, the firm's global chief economist, said the central bank has to walk a ""delicate line."""
25,"And whatever decision the Fed makes, economists say, will result in criticism."
26,"Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at abrdn, said he agrees with the consensus prediction that the central bank will approve an interest rate hike of a quarter of a percentage point."
27,"But he said that decision marks a shift from before the banking crisis, when a half percentage point hike was considered a more likely possibility."
28,"""The Fed faces a very tough decision this week,"" Bartholomew said."
29,"""Just a couple of weeks ago, Chair Powell seemed to be preparing the ground for the Fed to raise rates by 50bps in March in response to concerns about the inflation outlook."
30,"However, the rolling bank sector crisis now means many investors are expecting the Fed to keep policy on hold this week to avoid inflicting any more stress on markets."""

37,"Investors were on the edge of their seats, counting down to the conclusion of the Fed meeting on Wednesday afternoon."
38,The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates another 25 basis points.
39,"That could lead bitcoin and ether prices to sell off ""but not by much,"" Bernstein analysts said early Wednesday."
40,"""People are wondering if this is an economic crisis, or a just a crisis of financial conditions,"" said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro."
41,"""Right now, it looks like the latter, and markets are finding some relief in that."
42,"Headlines have calmed down, and investors are willing to look on the bright side of a growth obstacle – lower inflation and a resurgence in risk appetite."""
43,There is widespread uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates as the banking industry teeters.
44,"“It’s a coin toss now,” one strategist said."
45,"Reeling from a series of bank collapses that prompted intervention from authorities around the world and generated violent swings in financial markets, investors, analysts and economists are sure of nothing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates on Wednesday."
46,The S&P 500 index was flat in morning trading.
47,Stocks in Europe and Asia mostly posted small gains.

49,"“We still don’t know what is going to happen,” said Max Gokhman, an investment strategist at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions."
50,"“It presents a risk that there will be a much bigger move in markets after the announcement.”
 That uncertainty has been reflected in whipsaw trading over the past two weeks."
51,"Just days before authorities took control of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, testified to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates higher and faster in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy."

57,on Wednesday unveiled legislation that would beef up oversight of the Federal Reserve following two high-profile bank failures.
58,"The bill would require an independent inspector general, who would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, to oversee Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
59,The current inspector general for the Federal Reserve reports to the Fed board.
60,"“After the Federal Reserve’s failure to properly identify and prevent the shocking failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, it’s clear we can’t wait any longer for big change at the Fed,” Scott said in a release announcing the bill."
61,"“It’s outrageous that the Federal Reserve, the world’s largest and most powerful central bank, does not have a truly independent inspector general to investigate it – an independent authority to fight for the transparency and accountability our citizens need.”
 Warren, who has been an outspoken critic of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his leadership of the bank, echoed the call for an independent inspector general for the Federal Reserve."
62,"“The recent bank collapses and regulatory failures by the Fed have underscored the urgent need for a truly independent Inspector General to hold Fed officials accountable for any lapses or wrongdoing,” Warren said in the release."
63,"Warren blasted Powell earlier this week for rolling back regulations that she argues are key in preventing irresponsible banking behavior in the industry, since he took over the top position at the bank in 2018."
64,"“Donald Trump ran for president saying he would lighten the regulations on these banks,” Warren said during an interview on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” on Sunday."
65,"“And then Jerome Powell just literally took a flamethrower to these regulations, in order to make them less and less effective.”
 Scott said in a letter to Powell on Wednesday that the Fed had failed in its duty to regulate large financial institutions."
66,"“For too long, the Federal Reserve has used its claim of independence to thwart Congress and the American people while being unable or unwilling to properly regulate and supervise the large financial institutions under its care,” Scott wrote."
67,The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday as it works to tame inflation that remains above target and short-circuit a banking crisis that has seen three U.S. banks fail this month.
68,The Federal Reserve will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m.
69,"ET on Wednesday, with investors expecting the central bank to raise interest rates by 0.25% for the second-straight meeting."
70,"A quarter-point hike would bring the policy rate to a new range of 4.75%-5%, the highest since October 2007."
71,This announcement will come at the conclusion of one of the central bank's most uncertain meetings in years as the Fed looks to balance inflation that remains well above its target and a banking crisis that has rocked the financial sector.
72,Data from the CME Group on Wednesday showed investors placing nearly 90% odds on the Fed lifting rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.
73,"All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, set to begin at 2:30 p.m."

 Federal Reserve policymakers believe beating back inflation may require just one more interest-rate hike this year but less easing next year than most thought would be appropriate just three months ago."
96,"WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers believe beating back inflation may require just one more interest-rate hike this year but less easing next year than most thought would be appropriate just three months ago."
97,"U.S. central bankers see the policy rate, now in the 4.75%-5.00% range after Wednesday's 25-basis-point increase, at 5.1% by year end, according to the median estimate in the Fed's latest quarterly summary of economic projections."
98,"That's the same as the median projection in December, before a slew of stronger-than-expected readings on growth and inflation, but also before recent turmoil in the banking sector that policymakers expect will weigh on economic growth."
99,"Forecasts from the 18 policymakers were varied, however, with seven policymakers seeing a higher appropriate stopping point for rates."
100,One policymaker thought no further rate hikes would be needed.
101,"The benchmark rate is seen ending next year at 4.3%, based on the median projection."
102,"Views again varied widely, with four policymakers expecting rates to be 5.1%% or higher and four expecting rates to end the year below 4%."
103,"In December Fed policymakers thought 2023 would end with the Fed policy rate at 5.1%, before dropping to 4.1% in 2024."
104,"Policymakers meanwhile saw inflation by the Fed's preferred measure falling to 3.3% in the final quarter of this year, slower progress toward the Fed's 2% goal than expected in December."
105,"The personal consumption expenditures price index, the yardstick by which the Fed measures that progress, rose 5.4% in January from a year earlier."
106,"Policymakers expect their interest-rate hikes to push the unemployment rate, now at 3.6%, to 4.5% in the last quarter of 2023, and to 4.6% in 2024."
107,"Three months ago, the jobless rate was seen rising to 4.6% this year."
108,"By one measure, known as the Sahm Rule for former Fed staffer Claudia Sahm, an increase of that magnitude in the unemployment rate likely signals a recession.]"
109,"Wednesday's projections show Fed policymakers have become slightly more pessimistic about the outlook for the economy, with a median projection for GDP growth this year of 0.4%, versus December's expectation for 0.5%."
110,For 2024 they reduced their growth expectation to 1.2% from 1.6%.

112,"The Federal Reserve is set to announce its latest interest rate policy Wednesday, a decision that is a much more in doubt than it was barely a month ago due to the smouldering crisis in the U.S. banking system."
113,"The Federal Reserve is set to announce its latest interest rate policy Wednesday, a decision that is a much more in doubt than it was barely a month ago due to the smouldering crisis in the U.S. banking system."
114,"Most economists who watch the U.S. central bank expect it to raise its trendsetting interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point, as part of its ongoing campaign to wrestle inflation into submission."
115,"That would bring the U.S. interest rate to almost five per cent, its highest level in 16 years."
116,But the events in the financial sector during the past few weeks make that prediction much less of a sure thing.
117,"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed earlier this month, pushed into insolvency by a sudden bank run that saw depositors pull out billions of dollars from the bank in a matter of days, an exodus that the bank didn't have the funds to come up with."
118,"The capital crunch that started at SVB was followed by the failure of another major bank, Signature Bank."
119,"A third, First Republic Bank, was saved from collapse by a $30 billion cash infusion."
120,More are believed to be teetering.
121,"Although the causes were disparate, they share a common theme: an inability to withstand the impact of higher interest rates, once investors and depositors became spooked by the banks' finances."
122,"SVB's problems began when it had to sell $20 billion worth of government bonds at a loss, because the Fed's rate hikes had made those older, lower-yielding bonds less desirable."
123,"Inflation fight may come with a cost
 Much like many central banks, the Fed has been hiking its interest rate in order to bring down inflation, which topped out at more than nine per cent last summer."
124,The most recent data suggests the official U.S. inflation rate has come down to six per cent.
125,"That's still twice as high as the U.S. central bank likes to see, so all things being equal, the Fed would normally have no qualms about raising it again."
126,But fears of a banking crisis may cause the central bank to be more cautious.
127,"""Recent thinking has shifted to how much support the Fed may need to provide to shore up confidence in the U.S. banking system and avoiding a panic,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto."
128,"As recently as two weeks ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was telling lawmakers that the central bank was willing to raise rates by as much as necessary to rein in inflation — words that investors interpreted as meaning a large 50-point hike was on the table."
129,But that was then and this is now.
130,Traders on Wednesday were pricing in about a two-thirds chance of a small hike of 0.25 per cent.
131,That means there's a one in three chance the Fed will stand pat.
132,Futures markets even imply there's an expectation the Fed will actually have to cut rates as many as three times by the end of this year.
133,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told a banking conference on Tuesday that the situation is ""stabilizing"" and that the system ""remains sound"" but reinforced that the U.S. government will take whatever steps are needed to make sure depositors are safe."
134,"Another rate hike would only increase the likelihood of a U.S. lender getting squeezed, which is why investors think its doubtful the Fed will put its money where its mouth is and raise interest rates much higher in order to snuff out inflation."
135,"""It is a clear message from multiple officials that they are not taking this banking turmoil lightly and that they will probably be proactive when the next major risk arises,"" analyst Edward Moya with foreign exchange firm Oanda said."

 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is speaking at a news conference Wednesday afternoon following the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
142,"There’s no decisive indication in advance whether the Fed will continue its yearlong aggressive course of interest rate hikes, or instead hold off on an increase this time."
143,"Goldman Sachs, for one, is forecasting a pause in the Fed’s upward drive."
144,"Still, most experts are predicting a 25 basis point rise to come out of the FOMC meeting, which would put the new benchmark rates at 4.75 percent to 5 percent."
145,"Recent disturbances in the banking sector, including last weekend’s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, may have given the FOMC some cause for reflection, at least regarding its short term policy."
146,"Analysts believe that the sharply rising federal interest rate was a major contributor to the instability of several mid-size banks, most notably the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)."
147,"Nonetheless, Powell has recently — albeit pre-SVB collapse — made an argument for staying the course, saying that the hikes’ effect on inflation may be flagging."
148,"In either case, Goldman’s economists expect that any pause in the Fed’s upward interest rate trend would likely be temporary."

 U.S."
155,"Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has proposed legislation to stop the Federal Reserve from creating a direct-to-consumer central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a recent release."
156,"Cosponsored by Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Charles Grassley (R-IA), the ""bill goes a long way in making sure big government doesn’t attempt to centralize or control cryptocurrency and instead, allows it to thrive in the United States,"" Cruz had said in a statement."
157,"Since last year, the Biden administration and the U.S. central bank both have been examining the pros and cons of developing a CBDC, a central bank-issued digital currency that's denominated in the issuing country's fiat currency (such as the U.S. dollar, euro or yen)."
158,"In June 2022, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that a CBDC could preserve the U.S. dollar's standing and the Fed is assessing whether a U.S. CBDC ""would improve on an already safe and efficient domestic payments system."""
159,"""The federal government has no authority to unilaterally establish a central bank currency,"" Cruz emphasized."
160,Cruz's remarks come one day after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called for a state-level ban on a CBDC.

162,The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday as it attempts to fight stubbornly high inflation while addressing risks to financial stability.
163,(CNN) —The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday as it attempts to fight stubbornly high inflation while addressing risks to financial stability.
164,Investors and economists had widely anticipated the quarter-point increase despite the meltdown in the banking sector.
165,"Still, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and policymakers entered their second policymaking meeting of the year surrounded by an unusual level of uncertainty as the landscape surrounding the financial system continues to shift."
166,The central bank's mission in battling inflation became much more difficult over the past few weeks as the collapse of several banks meant the Fed had to balance a potential financial crisis alongside high inflation and a tight labor market.
167,"In a statement released at the conclusion of the meeting, Fed officials acknowledged that recent financial market turmoil is weighing on inflation and the economy, though they expressed confidence in the overall system."
168,"""The US banking system is sound and resilient,"" they wrote in their policy statement on Wednesday."
169,"""Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation."
170,"The extent of these effects is uncertain."""
171,"The Committee, they said ""remains highly attentive to inflation risks."""
172,"The banking chaos has stoked fears not just that the central bank could overcorrect the economy into recession but that it could trigger more bank failures, and prominent economists have urged the Fed to pause rate hikes."
173,"That's partially because rate hikes have undermined the value of Treasuries and other securities, a critical source of capital for most US banks."
174,"When Silicon Valley Bank was forced to sell those bonds quickly at a substantial loss, the bank ran into a liquidity crisis and collapsed."
175,"""The Fed's in a bit of a bind,"" former New York Fed President Bill Dudley told CNN."
176,"""On the one hand, they should keep tightening because inflation is still too high and the labor market is too tight."
177,"On the other hand, they want to make sure they don't do anything to exacerbate the stress on the banking system,"" he said."
178,"""There's not really a right solution."""
179,"Nine straight rate hikes
 Still, policymakers made their decision and hiked rates for the ninth consecutive time."
180,"They raised overnight lending rates to a range of 4.75% to 5%, their highest level since September 2007."
181,That sends a clear message that restoring price stability remains a top priority.
182,The decision to raise rates by a quarter point was unanimous.
183,No policymaker has voted against a decision since June last year.
184,Policymakers also released their rate projections for the first time since December.
185,Projections fell largely in line with previous forecasts.
186,"The Federal Reserve still expects to bring the interest rates 5.1% by the end of 2023, which means that they expect one more quarter-point rate hike before they pause."
187,"Officials did indicate, however, that interest rates will likely remain higher for longer as they brought their projected Federal funds rate up to 4.3% from 4.1% in 2024."
188,"In March, Powell indicated that interest rates could move higher and stay there for longer than previously expected, but current financial conditions could indicate less need to hold rates higher in order to cool the economy and bring down inflation."
189,Fed officials are now projecting deeper cuts to the economy over the next two years.
190,"Real GDP — a widely used measure of the economy — is forecast to grow by 0.4% this year, down from earlier projections of 0.5%."
191,"In 2024, officials project that the economy will grow by 1.2%, a cut from the 1.6% they projected in December."
192,"Fed policymakers also forecast that unemployment would drop lower than previously expected by the end of the year, to 4.5%, from the projected 4.6% in December."
193,"Inflation, meanwhile, could remain higher than expected, with Fed officials projecting that PCE inflation, its preferred gauge, could tick up this year to 3.3% from the previously forecast 3.1%."

250,"WASHINGTON/LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up but hovered around five-week lows on Wednesday, before the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting at which investors will be looking for any insight into what might happen with interest rates given the turmoil in the banking sector."
251,"Markets show a quarter-point rise in U.S. rates is the most likely outcome, but investors will be keen to hear what Chair Jerome Powell says about the crisis that has rattled global banks this month and how carefully the central bank feels it needs to tread."
252,"""The bank run has abated for the moment, but that might be contingent on what the Fed signals today,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto."
253,"""The risk is that the (Federal Open Market Committee) shatters the fragile calm in markets today... by acting too aggressively."""
254,"The Fed, together with other major central banks, has made provisions to grease the wheels of the financial system, after the failure of several smaller U.S. lenders and the implosion of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) at the weekend unleashed huge market volatility and a rout in banking stocks and bonds in particular."
255,"Following Credit Suisse's shotgun takeover by UBS (UBSG.S), and U.S. authorities and large banks helping prop up some of the more vulnerable regional institutions, investors are breathing a little more easily, leading to the dollar losing some of its safe-haven appeal this week."
256,The Fed meeting concludes on Wednesday with the 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) release of a policy statement followed half an hour later by a news conference by Powell.
257,"""Today's rate hike is priced in and expected and there would be no reason to not do it,"" Fiona Cincotta, a strategist with City Index, said."
258,"The dollar index rose 0.029% at 103.180, with the euro up 0.1% to $1.0778."
259,"Christopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC, said the focus will be on how the Fed communicates its forward guidance, in particular ""the higher for longer"" rhetoric."
260,"""Ideally, we would like the Fed to go with a 25 basis point hike this meeting, tone down hawkish guidance and emphasize that policy decisions at subsequent meetings will continue to be data-dependent,"" Wong said."
261,"The pound was last up 0.08% versus the dollar to trade at $1.2224 after data showed UK inflation came in much hotter than expected in February, which puts Bank of England policymakers in a tough position when they meet on Thursday."
262,"Markets show traders now fully expect a rate rise of 25 basis points, whereas just 24 hours ago, the chances of the bank raising by a quarter of a point or standing pat were 50/50."
263,"The Japanese yen weakened 0.20% to 132.80 per dollar, while the Australian dollar rose 0.07% to $0.667."
264,"In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was last up 0.86% at $28,394.00, but below Monday's nine-month peak."

276,"""We think any rate hike today is a mistake; we think the Fed has done enough to return inflation to the target, and we can't be sure that the threats to the banking system are over,"" Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson said."
277,"""Neither can we be sure of the severity of the real-world implications of last week's events, even with no further failures, though we are sure that the banking crisis is a deflationary event."
278,"But none of this likely will stop the Fed from hiking today."""

 WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - A conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat in the U.S. Senate are introducing legislation on Wednesday to replace the Federal Reserve's internal watchdog with one appointed by the president, aiming to tighten bank supervision following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank."
301,"Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Elizabeth Warren blamed the collapse of the two banks on regulatory failures at the U.S. central bank, which has operated up to now with an internal inspector general who reports to the Fed board."
302,"""Our legislation fixes that by establishing a presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed inspector general at the Fed, like every other major government agency,"" Scott said in a joint release with Warren."
303,"Warren said this month's banking upheavals ""have underscored the urgent need for a truly independent inspector general to hold Fed officials accountable for any lapses or wrongdoing."""
304,The Federal Reserve was not immediately available for comment.
305,The legislation was due to be introduced later on Wednesday.
306,"According to a four-page legislative text, the measure would replace the Fed's inspector general with an independent IG who would oversee the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
307,The CFPB is an independent bureau within the central bank that is responsible for consumer protection within the financial sector.
308,Warren played a key role in setting up the CFPB under Democratic President Barack Obama following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
309,"The U.S. Supreme Court last month agreed to hear a case challenging the CFPB's funding structure, which some conservatives argue violates the U.S. Constitution,
 The cooperation between Scott and Warren, who usually inhabit opposite poles of the political spectrum, could be the start of a new bipartisan push on banking."
310,Warren is a leading voice on financial matters.
311,"She sits on both the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and chairs subcommittees of both panels."
312,"Scott, a former Florida governor, is a hardline conservative who has positioned himself as a leading fiscal hawk."
313,"The show of bipartisanship poses a stark contrast with the partisan standoff between Republicans and Democratic President Joe Biden over the nation's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, which has raised concerns in the financial markets about a prolonged debate that could damage the U.S. economy."
314,"Both Republicans and Democrats have pledged tighter oversight of banking regulators following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which were followed by billions of dollars in losses for financial stocks."
315,"""We may end up in one of these strange-bedfellows situations,"" said Chris Brown, a banking lobbyist and former staffer on the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, which oversees the banking industry."
316,"""I do think there's overarching concern about what happened here,"" he said."
317,"House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, and the panel's top Democrat, Maxine Waters, have jointly scheduled a March 29 hearing on the banking system that will present testimony from officials with the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)."

366,"The Federal Reserve is grappling with a hazier economic picture, clouded by turmoil in the banking industry and still-high inflation, just as it meets to decide whether to keep raising interest rates or declare a pause."
367,"Most Fed watchers expect the central bank to announce on Wednesday afternoon a relatively modest quarter-point hike in its benchmark rate, its ninth increase since March of last year."
368,"Yet for the first time in recent memory, there remains some uncertainty about what the Fed will announce when it issues its policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time."
369,The central bank will not only have to decide whether to extend its year-long streak of rate hikes despite the jitters roiling the financial industry.
370,"The Fed’s policymakers will also try to peer into the future and forecast the likely path of growth, employment, inflation and their own interest rates."
371,Those forecasts will be particularly difficult this time.
372,"In their most recent forecasts in December, Fed officials projected that they would raise their short-term rate to about 5.1% by the end of this year, roughly a half-point above the current level."
373,Some Fed watchers expect the policymakers on Wednesday to raise that forecast to 5.3%.

376,But the upheaval in the banking industry has made any expectations far less certain.
377,The Fed is meeting less than two weeks after Silicon Valley Bank failed in the second-largest bank collapse in American history.
378,"That shock was followed by the failure of another major bank, Signature Bank."
379,"A third, First Republic Bank, was saved from collapse by a $30 billion cash infusion."
380,"Given the heightened uncertainties overhanging the financial system, there's a small chance that the Fed could decide not to issue its usual quarterly projections."
381,"Three years ago, when the pandemic struck, the Fed moved up a scheduled policy meeting to a Sunday, rather than on Tuesday and Wednesday, to urgently address the economic anxieties caused by new pandemic restrictions."
382,"After that meeting, the Fed didn’t release any quarterly projections."
383,"At the time, Powell said that issuing economic and interest rate forecasts, when the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were so unclear, “could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help.” Still, the unusual decision then was as much a reflection of the chaos of the early pandemic as it was of the uncertain outlook."
384,"If the Fed does raise its key rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, it would reach roughly 4.9%, the highest point in nearly 16 years."
385,"Early this month, Powell had said in congressional testimony that a half-point rate increase would be possible at this week's meeting."
386,The banking crisis has suddenly upended that outlook.
387,It will be a tough call for the 11 Fed officials who will vote on the rate decision.
388,"With hiring still strong, consumers still spending and inflation still elevated, a rate hike would normally be a straightforward move."
389,Not this time.
390,"The Fed is expected to treat inflation and financial turmoil as two separate problems, to be managed simultaneously by separate tools: Higher rates to address inflation and greater Fed lending to banks to calm financial turmoil."
391,Complicating matters will be the difficulty in determining the impact on the economy of the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature.
392,"The Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Treasury Department agreed to insure all the deposits at those banks, including those above the $250,000 cap."
393,"The Fed also created a new lending program to ensure that banks can access cash to repay depositors, if needed."
394,"But economists warn that many mid-sized and small banks, in order to conserve capital, will likely become more cautious in their lending."
395,"A tightening of bank credit could, in turn, reduce business spending on new software, equipment and buildings."
396,It could also make it harder for consumers to obtain auto or other loans.
397,Some economists worry that such a slowdown in lending could be enough to tip the economy into recession.
398,Wall Street traders are betting that a weaker economy will force the Fed to start cutting rates this summer.
399,Futures markets have priced in three quarter-point cuts by the end of the year.
400,"The Fed would likely welcome slower growth, which would help cool inflation."
401,But few economists are sure what the effects would be of a pullback in bank lending.
402,Other major central banks are also seeking to tame high inflation without worsening the financial instability caused by the two U.S. bank collapses and a hasty sale of the troubled Swiss bank Credit Suisse to its rival UBS.
403,"Even with the anxieties surrounding the global banking system, the Bank of England faces pressure to approve an 11th straight rate hike Thursday with annual inflation having reached 10.4%."
404,"And the European Central Bank, saying Europe’s banking sector was resilient, last week raised its benchmark rate by a half point to combat inflation of 8.5%."
405,"At the same time, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, has shifted to an open-ended stance regarding further increases."
406,"In light of uncertainties, she said, “we are neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates.”
 In the United States, most recent data still points to a solid economy and rampant hiring."
407,"Employers added a robust 311,000 jobs in February, the government said earlier this month."
408,"And while the unemployment rate rose, from 3.4% to a still-low 3.6%, that mostly reflected an influx of new job-seekers who were not immediately hired."
409,"Consumer spending was robust in January, fueled in part by a large cost-of-living adjustment for 70 million recipients of Social Security and other benefits."
410,The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects that the economy will have expanded at a healthy annual rate of 3.2% in the first three months of this year.
411,"The most influential central bank in the world is expected to hike rates even after banking sector chaos
 The world’s most influential central bank moves to the centre of attention across global markets this evening, when the US Federal Reserve makes a hotly anticipated decision on interest rates."
412,"Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector."
413,"The latest poll undertaken by financial data provider Refinitiv shows that 15% of economists expect no change, with 85% predicting a 0.25% rise, the same action taken in February."
414,Wednesday’s announcement on US interest rates marks the anniversary of the first hike of the current cycle.
415,It has lifted its Fed Funds target rates eight times since to its current range of 4.5% and 4.75%.
416,It was at 0.25% to 0.50% a year ago.
417,"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank -- the biggest since the 2008 financial crisis -- and the rescue of a series of regional US lenders, stemmed in part from the sharp drop in the value of their government bond holdings due to rising base rates."
418,So did the $3.3 billion (£2.7 billion) fire sale of fallen finance giant Credit Suisse to UBS.
419,"Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”
 The speed at which the hikes have rippled through the financial system has picked up, reducing the number of buyers for the government bonds which banks hold because they can be readily sold."
420,"That has made it more difficult to turn bonds into ready cash to meet financial commitments, knocking faith in the system."
421,"Loading....
 And the fall in demand for bonds as base rates have galloped higher has left a hole on balance sheets from New York to Geneva and London in unrealised losses as their value has dropped, adding to what has, at times, amounted to a sense of crisis."
422,"In turn, that looks to have left the Fed with less room to act on its instincts that the fight against US inflation is some way from being won."
423,"So much so, there was even talk on Wall Street and in the City earlier in the week that tonight’s vote on rates on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) might even produce a cut."
424,"Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, called that speculation “a ridiculous notion,” and said it would “send the completely the wrong message at a time when optics are everything.”
 He added: If the Fed does have concerns about some parts of the US banking sector, why weren’t they apparent 3 weeks ago when they were pushing the case for keeping a 0.50% rate hike on the table?"
425,"Ultimately a rate cut could prompt further volatility, prompting a market freak out in that the situation could be far worse than realised.”
 At the last rate call in February, investors were looking out for signals from the Fed about the potential end of its run of hikes."
426,"The lack of them hit stocks around the world, even as the Fed approved a 0.25% rise, in line with expectations."
427,"This time around, there will also be fresh projections on the economy and the outlook on rates from members of the FOMC this time around, which will be scrutinised by investors after two weeks of drama centred on the banks."
428,"The Fed’s decision to raise rates is likely to put more pressure on regional banks, which will make it harder to avoid a recession."
429,Federal Reserve policymakers have targeted a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy since beginning their effort a year ago to tame runaway inflation by hiking interest rates.
430,"That is, they believed they could do so without sending the U.S. into recession."
431,"But the Fed’s decision to raise rates by a quarter point on March 22, 2023, and modestly lift its projection for how much higher they will go in 2024 does little to ease the growing concerns about the health of regional banks."
432,"As an economist who studies the macroeconomy, I believe this makes the soft landing scenario less likely."
433,"Squeezing regional banks
 The Fed’s latest moves suggest policymakers don’t expect the banking sector stress to spill over into the broader economy."
434,"Had it believed so, it probably would have paused its rate hikes entirely."
435,"Chair Jerome Powell, in a press conference following the announcement, assured the public that the banking system is strong, sound, resilient and has ample capital."
436,"But the hike, paired with the acknowledgment of banking sector uncertainty, acts against those very assurances by creating additional stress."
437,It will shrink lenders’ profit margins as the cost of funding continues to rise and tighter credit conditions force banks to dial back on lending.
438,This will be felt most by smaller regional banks and the communities they serve.
439,Regional banks are a valuable source of credit for small businesses and mortgage lenders.
440,"As credit conditions tighten, it is becoming more likely the Fed may have been too aggressive in raising rates over the past year."
441,"And while the Fed has said it stands at the ready to provide liquidity to banks, that won’t stop depositors from moving their money into safer institutions offering higher returns – which increases the risk of further bank runs, similar to those that felled Silicon Valley Bank."
442,"Recession risks rising
 In congressional testimony also on March 22, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. has no plans to provide “blanket insurance” for all deposits regardless of size – the current limit is US$250,000 – after earlier reports suggested that it might do just that."
443,"Markets reacted badly to this news, coming at about the same time as the Fed decision."
444,Investors such as Bill Ackman worried this will lead to an acceleration of deposits fleeing regional banks.
445,"In the end, I believe the rate hike will cause more harm in the banking sector than the Fed anticipates."
446,And this reduces the likelihood of a soft landing – and increases the odds of recession.
447,The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates by as much as a quarter percentage point Wednesday amid several high-profile bank failures in the United States that have rattled world financial markets this month.

 The Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on March 19, 2019.Leah Millis/Reuters
 Just two weeks ago, Federal Reserve officials were hinting that they might consider a large, half-point rate increase at the conclusion of their meeting Wednesday as the economy showed sustained momentum."
471,A series of bank failures since then have not only convinced investors and Wall Street economists that policy-makers will lift borrowing costs by just a quarter-point Wednesday – some are questioning whether central bankers will raise them at all.
472,"Investors are most heavily betting on a quarter-point increase, but are pencilling in a chance that the Fed will pause what has been a steady campaign to raise borrowing costs to contain rapid inflation."
473,"Goldman Sachs economists think it is likely that central bankers will hold off on a rate move this month, before resuming them in May."
474,This Fed decision carries enormously high stakes.
475,"If investors believe that central bankers are not sufficiently attuned to the turmoil gripping the banking industry, jittery markets could recoil."
476,"Yet if officials pause their rate increases to allow the tumult to pass, they could appear to be giving up on their fight against still-rapid inflation."
477,"Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, will have a chance to explain both the Fed’s rate decision and its latest economic projections – which are scheduled for their first update since December – at a 2:30 p.m. Eastern news conference following the release of the decision and projections half an hour earlier."
478,Powell may need to walk a fine line as he balances stubborn inflation with unfolding banking industry problems.
479,"Here’s what to watch, and why this meeting will be so fraught."
480,A rate increase could further squeeze banks.
481,The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 tied back partly to the Fed’s recent rate moves: The bank held a lot of long-term securities that had become less valuable as interest rates rose.
482,Those losses helped to spook its depositors and spark a bank run that led to the bank’s collapse.
483,"The question for the Fed is whether the bank’s demise is an isolated instance of a firm that did not plan well enough for rising borrowing costs, or a sign that the central bank’s fastest rate increases since the 1980s have pushed the financial system to a breaking point."
484,Inflation remains a big challenge.
485,"The Fed is raising interest rates for a reason, though: Inflation is high, and it is not going away quickly."
486,"Consumer prices increased by 6 per cent in the year through February, and while annual inflation has been slowing, monthly gains have recently sped back up."
487,That bumpy progress has come just as the broader economy has proved more resilient than expected.
488,"Strong momentum in prices and the labour market would usually spur more aggressive Fed rate moves, but bank upheaval is a complication: If smaller banks lend less amid the turmoil, that itself could slow the economy."
489,Rate projections could be key.
490,"Given the uncertainty, the Fed’s economic projections could become a focal point."
491,"The central bank releases its forecasts once every three months, offering a snapshot of how officials expect unemployment, inflation and interest rates to evolve."
492,Fed officials had been widely expected to nudge up their forecasts for how high rates would rise by the end of 2023 – an estimate that stood at just above 5 per cent in December.
493,Whether that peak rate estimate will move in the latest projections is now much less certain.
494,"Some economists – including Diane Swonk at KPMG – think that the Fed could scrap the economic projections altogether at this meeting, given the uncertain backdrop."
495,"But if they do give estimates, it will offer insight into how much of a beating officials expect the economy to take from the banking crisis."
496,"Economic estimates had to be submitted the Friday before the meeting, but officials could change them up until Tuesday night."

809,"The dozen lawmakers note that the same 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank gives the Fed latitude in applying tougher regulation on banks in this category – including stronger capital, liquidity, stress testing and resolution plans."
810,"Notably, the letter was signed by Senator Angus King, the Maine independent who voted in favor of the 2018 rollback."
811,"It was also signed by Sanders and Democratic Senators Jack Reed, Tammy Duckworth, Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Sheldon Whitehouse, Tina Smith, Chris Van Hollen and Brian Schatz."
812,"“Irresponsible and excessive risk taking by SVB and Signature executives should serve as a clear reminder that banks cannot be left to supervise themselves,” Warren and the other Senate Democrats wrote."
813,"“The Fed has a responsibility to ensure financial stability, and in order to fulfill that responsibility, it must ensure that all banks with potential systemic significance are subject to rigorous safety and soundness rules.”
 The lawmakers argue that the federal intervention in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures underscore the systemic risk posed by troubles in banks of this size."
814,Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday that US officials took “decisive and forceful actions” to calm the banking crisis after the bank failures.
815,What will the Fed do?
816,"Days after the bank failures, the Federal Reserve launched a review of the regulation and oversight of Silicon Valley Bank."
817,"That review is being led by Barr, who President Joe Biden nominated to be the Fed’s top regulator of Wall Street."
818,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a frequent target of Warren’s criticism, called for a “thorough, transparent and swift review” by the Fed."
819,"The Fed is rethinking some of its own rules related to midsize banks, including potentially ramping up capital and liquidity requirements and stepping up annual “stress tests,” the Wall Street Journal previously reported."
820,"“We strongly support this approach,” Warren and her colleagues wrote in the letter."
821,"“In order to restore sufficient safety practices to the banking system and restore consumers’ confidence in the soundness of their banks, the Fed must immediately exercise its authority to apply enhanced prudential standards and supervision to banks with $100-$250 billion in assets.”
 Warren has long been a regulation hawk, pushing for tough rules to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis and sharply criticizing those who have relaxed rules on banks."
822,"‘Serious mistake’
 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email."
823,"“Their failures destabilized the financial system in the process and caused federal banking regulators to take measures (such as insuring all the deposits at the two failed banks) that will tempt banks to bet on even bigger risks in the future.”
 
 
 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile."
824,"WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile."
825,"Instead, the rapid expansion of the Fed's holdings of cash and bonds has emerged as a key tool to help contain financial stability issues, speaking to the core mission of why the central bank was founded just over a century ago."
826,"The usage of these lending facilities, including the Fed's long-shunned discount window for bank lending, gave the central bank room, should it choose it, to press forward with rate rises and avoid past cycles of being forced to stand aside or cut rates when markets suffer notable turbulence."
827,"While the Fed may have underestimated how rate rises and its bank oversight would affect the financial system, ""in one way they were remarkably prescient — the Fed has been trying to institutionalize reforms to the discount window designed to improve financial stability in the aftermath of the early-COVID financial crisis,"" wrote Joseph Politano, of Apricitas Economics, in a newsletter Saturday."
828,"The ""unprecedented use of the discount window partially reflects the desired results of those reforms."""
829,"Evercore ISI analysts pointed to the seeming contradiction of an expanded balance sheet driven by financial stability concerns happening as monetary policy tightens, and noted there is ""rarely a perfect separation between financial stability and monetary policy goals."
830,"Messy real world policymaking needs to embrace this."""
831,"BIG NUMBERS
 Fed numbers showed the speed of the shift to a new balance sheet reality."
832,"Last Thursday, Fed data showed a massive surge in lending to banks, driven notably by $153 billion in what’s called discount window credit, up from $5 billion the week before and blazing through a record set in the fall of 2008, when the financial crisis pushed banks to take $112 billion."
833,"That borrowing, which also saw other large-size Fed credit extensions, pushed the size of the Fed’s overall balance sheet up to $8.7 trillion on Wednesday, versus $8.4 trillion the week before."
834,Fed holdings peaked at just shy of $9 trillion last summer.
835,"On the face of it, the emergency borrowing unraveled months of progress in which the Fed allowed some of the Treasury and mortgage securities it owns to expire each month."
836,"This effort, known in markets as quantitative tightening, or QT, complemented the Fed’s aggressive rate rises aimed at bringing down inflation."
837,That puts the central bank in a seemingly awkward position.
838,"While the banking sector’s woes have generated considerable uncertainty into the outcome of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting which concludes Wednesday, the Fed nevertheless appears on track for another quarter point rate rise."
839,"The details of Fed holdings matters greatly in terms of understanding Fed balance sheet dynamics, analysts say."
840,"Benson Durham, head of global policy at Piper Sandler, said the key is the composition and not the size of Fed holdings."
841,"Emergency borrowing has driven up the overall level of Fed holdings, but the Fed continues to shed bonds and cut the level of reserves in the banking system, which is how the QT process has worked all along, he said."
842,"Even with a jump in the balance sheet the Fed is “still credit tightening” and when it comes to the increase in the overall size, “it’s hard for me to imagine that this is remotely inflationary,” Durham said."
843,"Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist with SGH Global Advisors, agreed and said the Fed emergency lending is “not funding that's going into banks that they can make loans with per se,” a key factor blunting any form of new stimulus."
844,"There’s even a case for how some of the underlying factors driving banks to borrow Fed cash point to the tighter financial conditions the central bank has sought to control inflation, and which could hamper growth."
845,"Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said “a tightening of bank lending conditions could lead to a broader tightening of financial conditions that would meaningfully dent growth prospects and heighten recession probabilities.”
 LESS ROOM TO RUN?"
846,One factor limiting economists’ interpretation of the balance sheet surge is the fluidity of the factors now driving it.
847,"“At this early stage in the process, it is unclear how much of the Fed’s emergency lending will turn out to be sticky,” analysts at Wrightson ICAP said in a note over the weekend."
848,"But even with that caveat, the firm saw some potential implications for how the Fed proceeds with its balance sheet drawdown, depending on banks' reserve positions."
849,"Even if, as expected, the FOMC decides at the meeting to keep the drawdown at its current pace of $100 billion per month, it may allow the drawdown to end earlier than previously expected."
850,"There’s little doubt banks’ demand for reserves has risen amid more fragile conditions, the note said."
851,"“If some of the recent surge in emergency lending runs off in the weeks ahead, it may very well be the case that this episode has nudged the banking system closer to the point of effective reserve scarcity rather than farther away.”

852,"The Federal Reserve is considering whether to keep raising interest rates to curb price increases, even if it risks further instability in the financial system."
853,"Faced with ongoing instability in the banking system and persistent consumer price increases, the Federal Reserve has an unusually tricky choice to make between a familiar set of options: raise interest rates or don’t."
854,"If Fed officials choose the former at the end of their regularly scheduled two-day policy meeting kicking off Tuesday, they’ll be prioritizing the inflation challenge, even if it means risking further turmoil on Wall Street over a series of meltdowns and takeovers for troubled lenders."
855,If policymakers opt instead to leave rates alone — virtually no one expects a rate cut — it will represent a pause on the crusade against inflation and a sign that tamping down banking jitters is the more pressing need.
856,"Regardless of the outcome, all eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is set to deliver remarks at 2:30 p.m."
857,"ET Wednesday, for indications of how the Fed sees its role in navigating the storm."
858,"The central bank is also scheduled to release its quarterly round of economic projections Wednesday, which will include policymakers’ forecasts on inflation and rate hikes through 2025."
859,The latest 12-month inflation data came in at 6% for February.
860,"That was slightly lower than January’s 6.4% level — and down from a 9% peak last summer — but still well above the Fed’s 2% target, showing that price pain for consumers is lingering despite gradual declines."
861,"A more detailed inflation measure the Fed has been watching, so-called supercore inflation — which measures price increases driven by everyday services costs like haircuts or meals out — even increased slightly last month, leading many analysts to anticipate further rate hikes were likely."
862,"The recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, followed by a rush to shore up the finances of Credit Suisse and First Republic, scrambled those forecasts."
863,"Current expectations are mixed: Many analysts expect a quarter-percentage-point interest rate hike Wednesday, while others anticipate a pause."
864,That is partly because the Fed’s own actions to curb inflation have been seen as factors in the bank collapses.
865,"The problems that sparked the meltdowns were distinct to each of the two failed lenders, but higher interest rates had put pressure on both — as they have across the financial industry."
866,"By raising its key federal funds interest rate, the Fed sets off a chain reaction of rate increases in other parts of the economy, making it more expensive to borrow and invest and thus cooling demand for goods and services."
867,That is precisely the central bank’s desired outcome in its fight against inflation.
868,The Fed has hiked its effective rate from near zero a year ago to more than 4.5% today.
869,"After its eight consecutive increases, consumers now face higher borrowing costs in a range of places, from credit card interest rates of nearly 20% to auto loan rates of about 6.5%."
870,"“They’re saying, ‘We have to weigh that inflation fight versus the banking system and adding more stress in an already stressed system,’” said Michael Antonelli, managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. financial services group, referring to Fed officials."
871,"“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase."
872,"Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, took a different view, writing in a note Monday that the “Fed can show it knows how to walk and chew gum.”
 While the central bank does not usually increase rates during periods of financial instability, Dutta said, “the Fed has different tools to deal with different problems.” He noted that regulators around the world, including the Fed, have taken steps in recent days to give banks wider access to funding to forestall a broader crisis."
873,"Dutta said in his note that he expected a 0.25% rate hike, adding, “I think it is premature to assume the inflation outlook has changed much because of what we’re seeing unfold in markets.”
 
 
 Federal Reserve officials have a difficult path ahead of them."

 Federal Reserve officials have a difficult path ahead of them."
880,"They still have work to do to bring inflation down, but their efforts have been complicated by the events of the past few weeks."
881,"The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the ongoing stress in the regional banking sector (there may be nearly 190 lenders at risk of failure, according to a new study) have put the Federal Reserve in a strange situation."
882,"Policymakers don’t want to raise interest rates and risk further damage to the system, but Fed officials also remain worried about persistent inflation."
883,"Two weeks ago, officials had likely planned to hike rates by at least half a percentage point."
884,"Now, the banking meltdown has complicated that strategy."
885,"Wall Street is betting on a quarter-point hike, while some prominent economists are calling for a temporary pause."
886,"But in a strange twist, it’s possible that the banking meltdown actually did some work for the Fed in bringing down prices without raising interest rates."
887,"What’s happening: Fears of a bank run cause lenders to take fewer risks with their capital reserves to ensure they have enough cash to cover any potential withdrawal requests, said analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics."
888,"That makes them “disinflationary events,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday."
889,Economic growth could be reduced by as much as half a percentage point in 2023 if small and midsize banks tighten their lending standards.
890,"That could have the equivalent effect of the Fed hiking rates by half a point, said Goldman Sachs economists on Tuesday."
891,"That’s because banks with less than $250 billion in assets account for about 50% of US commercial and industrial lending, 60% of residential real estate lending, 80% of commercial real estate lending and 45% of consumer lending, according to Goldman analysts led by chief economist Jan Hatzius."
892,"Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in a note that the banking meltdown could have an even larger effect on the economy, equivalent to a percent-and-a-half rate hike by the Fed."
893,"“In other words, over the past week, monetary conditions have tightened to a degree where the risks of a sharper slowdown in the economy have increased,” he wrote in a note over the weekend."
894,"The other side: Still, some economists don’t think the Fed is off the hook."
895,"Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in The Financial Times this week that if the Fed doesn’t increase interest rates, it would “set up more policy flip-flops that fail to deliver a soft landing while amplifying unsettling financial volatility.”
 In an interview with Bloomberg this week, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said the Fed should be wary of falling prey to financial dominance — when the Fed doesn’t tighten monetary policy because of potential risks to the stability of the financial system."
896,"“It would be very unfortunate if, out of solicitude for the banking system, the Fed were to slow down its rate of interest-rate increase beyond what was appropriate given the credit contraction,” he said."
897,"Bank stocks rebound as Janet Yellen, Jamie Dimon work to restore confidence
 The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank rippled through markets last week."
898,Small and mid-sized banks across the United States saw their stocks plummet to new lows as fear of contagion set in and the stability of the financial system was challenged.
899,"On Tuesday, an unlikely superduo — US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon — formed to bolster investor confidence and propel regional bank stocks."
900,"Yellen, speaking at the American Bankers Association on Tuesday, delivered a very clear message to markets: The US is prepared to protect smaller banks and their deposits if necessary, she said."
901,"The Treasury secretary reiterated that the federal government would be willing to rescue uninsured depositors at small banks if lenders suffer bank runs, raising the specter of contagion."
902,"“We are ready and prepared to take the steps that are necessary to ensure depositors that the banking system and their deposits are safe,” Yellen said."
903,"Jamie Dimon, meanwhile, led talks to create a rescue plan for First Republic and forge a path forward for the beleaguered bank, according to a Wall Street Journal report."
904,Yellen and Dimon’s efforts appeared to do the trick.
905,"Shares of First Republic soared nearly 30% in trading on Tuesday, after dropping by 47% to new lows in the previous session."
906,"The SPDR Regional Banking Equity Traded Fund, which tracks a number of small and mid-sized bank stocks, gained 5.8% for the day."

 By CNN’s Anna Bahney
 The median price of a US home was lower this February than it was in February 2022, ending more than a decade of year-over-year increases, the longest on record, according to a National Association of Realtors report released Tuesday."
910,"The median existing home price was $363,000 in February, down 0.2% from a year ago."
911,This marks the first monthly year-over-year price decline since February 2012.
912,"“This is not the bottom for prices,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for NAR."
913,"“We expect a continuing price correction, but we are not expecting prices to crash.”
 The median decrease is so small, he said, it is essentially flat."
914,But it marks the first technical drop in median home prices that is expected to continue.
915,“Could we see 5% decline?
916,"Sure, but we could also see 5% increase."
917,"My forecast has prices declining 2% this year,” he said."
918,"But home sales vaulted higher, marking the largest monthly percentage increase since July 2020, which itself was an anomaly of the pandemic as some restrictions loosened that month to allow a backlog of sales."
919,"US home sales surged in February, following a full year of declining home sales due to surging mortgage rates and prices that remained elevated, which kept homebuyers out of the market."
920,"February’s reversal in sales also ended the longest streak of month-to-month declining home sales on record, going back to 1999 for all homes and 1968 for single-family homes."

923,"New York CNN —
 The Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, are facing a legacy-defining moment as their two-day monetary policy meeting concludes on Wednesday."
924,The mission?
925,Slay the inflation dragon without singeing the banking system.
926,"Among the choices, the Fed could continue its aggressive rate-hike campaign to cool inflation that is running at triple the central bank’s target of 2%."
927,It could take a time-out to assess how that campaign has strained the banking system.
928,Or it could split the difference and raise rates by a quarter point to show its commitment to both the inflation fight and financial system stability.
929,"Instead of higher rates for longer, some economists are even penciling in rate cuts late this year if the banking crisis fuels a recession."
930,"For Powell and Co., the stakes are high."
931,"“I don’t think he should be chairman of the Federal Reserve,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren told NBC’s Meet The Press this weekend."
932,Warren — already a critic of the Fed’s inflation fight — leveled further blistering criticism of the Republican Fed chief.
933,"Powell has failed at both monetary policy and bank supervision, she said."
934,"Nominated by then-President Donald Trump, Powell was renominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021 for a term ending in 2026."
935,"“In terms of Powell’s legacy, the damage has already been done,” said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult."
936,"In addition to achieving price stability and financial stability, the Fed’s broader mandate includes supervision of individual financial institutions, Leer says, and “that’s where the failure lies."
937,"The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”
 Allianz economist Mohammed El-Erian also gives the Fed low marks in its inflation fight."
938,"Inflation was not, it turns out, transitory, as Powell (and, to be fair, many others) forecast early."
939,"“The Fed needs to secure both price stability and financial stability, something that it has failed to so recently,” he told CNN."
940,"“Having already dug itself, and the US economy, into a big hole with its prolonged mischaracterization of inflation and flip-flopping policies, it can ill afford another slippage in what is proving to be the biggest policy mistake in the last four decades.”
 For any Fed chief, there are more challenges than tools to tackle them."
941,And this Fed chief inherited an unprecedented economy.
942,"“Powell has been stuck between a rock and a hard place from the moment he became Chair,” said Ann Berry, founder of Threadneedle Ventures."
943,"He was “handed two administrations without fiscal discipline and two black swan events of a global pandemic and a Twitter-driven bank run.”
 “He has read correctly the labor market’s ability to sustain full employment in the face of necessary rate hikes,” she said, “but while I’ve been a Fed apologist until now — because decision making in the face of mixed data is excruciatingly hard — history won’t judge kindly the late start to Fed tightening and the failure to catch SVB’s obviously flawed risk management.”
 The crystal ball is murky."
944,"It’s been just two weeks since Powell opened the door to higher and maybe faster interest rate increases, responding to a strong economy and consumer inflation still triple its target."
945,"Since then, three US banks have failed and tens of billions of dollars in customer deposits have flowed out of small and midsized banks into the perceived security of big banks."
946,Ailing Credit Suisse has been taken over by its rival UBS in a central-bank led shotgun wedding.
947,"And the US Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and global central banks have taken measures to protect their own banks and liquidity."
948,"“Taken in isolation, the economy looks very, very good right now."
949,"And the Fed would probably be raising rates without what’s going on right now,” said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo."
950,"“That said, what’s going on right now is very unsettling that makes the future very uncertain."
951,And we’ve seen a tightening in financial markets.
952,"So the Fed may decide to take a pause here just to see how things settle down.”
 Economists at Goldman Sachs also expect the Fed to pause, writing in a note to clients this week that “stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern right now.”

 Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with those banks to do its job?"
954,"The recent crashes of three U.S. lenders — Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank — has slashed confidence in the nation’s banking system."
955,"The debacles have also put financial regulators on the hot seat, notably the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the overseer of both Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank."
956,"Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?"
957,A factor contributing to that view — the practice of regional banks in the Federal Reserve system having executives of the institutions they regulate sit on their boards.
958,"Beginning in 2019, Gregory Becker, the former CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, who presided over its rise and fall, was a director of the San Francisco Fed."
959,"After his bank collapsed, he was removed from the San Francisco Fed board."
960,"Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, interacted with the Fed for decades, both as an auditor and as a regulator."
961,"“The Fed serves to protect the banks rather than serving the American depositors and investors,” he said in an interview."
962,"“To call the Fed a ‘bank supervisor’ with bank executives on their boards is absolutely an oxymoron.”
 Silvergate, with $12 billion in deposits, and Silicon Valley Bank, with $160 billion, collapsed for different reasons."
963,"But, analysts said, rising risks in both institutions’ operations were in plain sight."
964,"Yet Fed examiners responsible for policing them seem to have done little or nothing to correct or rein them in, the analysts said."
965,"And, unlike other financial regulators, the Fed also seemed to disregard a warning it got last summer about risks of bank runs posed by unfettered crypto operations."
966,"Silvergate closed because it facilitated crypto transactions that became toxic after FTX collapsed; Silicon Valley, meanwhile, had too little cash to handle a depositor run and was forced to sell investments at losses."
967,Both risks had been well-known for months and were publicized either in regulatory filings or in statements made by the banks’ executives.
968,Silvergate said this month it was winding down its operations.
969,The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is still seeking buyers for Silicon Valley Bank or its assets.
970,"Signature Bank, which had crypto exposure, had also encountered the beginnings of a run by panicked depositors when its regulators in New York seized it on March 12."
971,"On March 13, the Federal Reserve Board announced a review of the supervision of Silicon Valley Bank."
972,"Leading the review is Michael Barr, its vice chair for supervision, who said in a statement: “We need to have humility and conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience.” No such review relating to the Fed’s oversight of Silvergate Bank has been announced."

 Attempts to reach the San Francisco Fed for comment on its regulatory actions were unsuccessful."
975,"Its media line rang busy over several days, and no email address is provided for reporters’ inquiries."
976,"Neither does the main number provide a way to reach a spokesperson, and there was no reply to an email seeking comment sent to a general mailbox."
977,"Tyler Gellasch is the president and CEO of Healthy Markets, an investor-focused nonprofit organization, and a former counsel for then-Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who helped to draft the Dodd-Frank banking reforms."
978,"Asked about the Fed’s oversight of the two failed banks, he said: “There will always be bad actors and incompetent management teams, but banking regulators exist to stop them before they make multibillion-dollar messes."
979,"And if the regulators can’t do that on the easy stuff, then what are they there for?”
 Certainly, red flags were flying at both institutions, analysts said."
980,"At Silicon Valley Bank, the signs were a minuscule cash position available for depositor demands — only 6% of assets, compared with 9.5% held by its peer institutions, regulatory filings show."
981,"And the bank’s tidal wave of deposits — more than tripling in three years, from $57 billion to $183 billion in 2022 — should have raised questions about its management’s ability to handle such growth, analysts said."
982,"“The bottom line is that there was a lax regulatory oversight of Silicon Valley’s operations,” Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners LLC, wrote in a note to clients March 12."
983,"The relaxed policing was partly due to a less stringent regulatory framework for smaller institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, he concluded, and “partly due to its inept regulatory oversight body, (i.e., the Federal Reserve).”
 At Silvergate, the peril centered on crypto."
984,It was one of just a few U.S. banks allowing customers to move dollars or other so-called fiat currencies onto crypto exchanges.
985,"Once a sleepy industrial loan company in San Diego with four branches, Silvergate began the switch to crypto in 2013."
986,"Among its clients — and promoters — was Sam Bankman-Fried, a co-founder of the cratered crypto exchange FTX and its related companies."
987,"FTX companies held 20 different accounts at Silvergate, according to a bankruptcy filing; one was North Dimension, a company with a peculiar and apparently phony electronics website that prosecutors said was central to FTX’s misappropriation of customers’ funds."
988,"As a regulated institution, Silvergate was responsible for monitoring its clients’ accounts for illegal activities, such as money laundering or tax evasion, and alerting regulators to suspicious transactions."
989,"Before the bank began closing down, it told NBC News it “conducted significant due diligence on FTX and its related entities.”
 As its extensive ties to FTX became known, however, Silvergate faced huge redemption demands from depositors."
990,"In December, customers withdrew almost 70% of the bank’s $11.9 billion in deposits, according to a February report by the inspector general of the FDIC."
991,"Racing to meet the redemptions, the bank sold $5.2 billion in debt securities it held for investment, losing $718 million in the process."
992,"That was more than the bank had earned since 2013, the IG report said."
993,"Caitlin Long is the founder of Custodia Bank Inc., a special purpose depository institution in Wyoming that acts as custodian of digital assets and holds only cash, in amounts that exceed its deposits, to meet possible redemptions."
994,"Last summer, she said, she warned federal financial regulators, including the Fed, that the risks of bank runs were high among institutions serving the crypto industry."
995,"“There was bank run risk all over this industry,” she said in an interview."
996,"“I don’t think any investment other than cash is appropriate for a bank in this sector, because, as we saw, all the deposits can be withdrawn in a few seconds.”

 Other regulators reacted to her warning, but the Fed did not respond to her about it, Long said."
998,"In January, it denied her bank’s application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System."
999,The Fed said that “the firm’s application as submitted is inconsistent with the required factors under the law.” It also contended that the firm’s business model and proposed focus on digital assets presented safety and soundness risks.
1000,"Long disagreed, noting that Custodia has cash backing more than 100% of its deposits."
1001,Custodia has sued the Fed in federal district court over the decision.
1002,"Existing banks with crypto operations — like Silvergate — seem to have been “waved through without questions” by the Fed, Long said, “while the startups that were seeking permission for everything we did were denied.” All in all, a perplexing paradox, she said."

1004,"CNN —
 All eyes are trained on the Federal Reserve as it prepares to announce another potential interest rate hike Wednesday afternoon – exactly 10 days after the Biden administration stepped in with dramatic emergency actions to contain the fallout from two bank failures."
1005,Biden White House officials will be closely watching the highly anticipated rate decision – and monitoring every word of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s public comments – for any telling clues on how the central bank is processing what has emerged one of the most urgent economic crises of Joe Biden’s presidency.
1006,"The moment creates a complex, if carefully observed, dynamic for the administration’s top economic officials who have spent much of the last two weeks engaged in regular discussions and consultations with Powell and Fed officials as they’ve navigated rapid and acute risks to the banking system."
1007,The Fed’s central role is not only to supervise US banks and the stability of the financial system.
1008,"It also can provide backup funds for banks in moments of systemic risk, a responsibility that has once again thrust the central bank back to center stage in the government’s effort to stabilize rattled markets."
1009,But Biden has made the central bank’s independence on monetary policy an unequivocal commitment – and has repeatedly underscored that he has confidence in the Fed’s central role in navigating inflation that has weighed on the US economy for more than a year and remained stubbornly persistent.
1010,"Even as some congressional Democrats have directed fire at Powell for the rapid increase in interest rates and the risks the effort poses to a robust post-pandemic economic recovery, White House officials have taken pains not to shed light on their views publicly."
1011,Officials stress nothing in the last week has changed that mandate from Biden – and note that the widespread uncertainty about what action the Fed will take on rates only serves to underscore that reality.
1012,"It’s a reality that comes at a uniquely inopportune time for a banking system that has shown clear signs of stabilizing in the last several days, but is still facing a level of anxiety among market participants and depositors about the durability of that shift."
1013,"“I do believe we have a very strong and resilient banking system and all of us need to shore up the confidence of depositors that that’s the case,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during remarks Tuesday in Washington."
1014,"Yellen said a new emergency lending facility launched by the Fed, along with its existing discount window, are “working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system.”
 But prior to the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, analysts had widely predicted that the Fed would unveil a half-point rate hike."
1015,"But after the sudden collapse of the two banks that sent shockwaves across the global economy, there has been a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the central bank will pull back, and only raise rates by a quarter-point – in part to try to alleviate concerns that the Fed’s historically aggressive rate hikes over the past year were precisely to blame for this month’s financial turmoil."
1016,"But there are also concerns that a dramatic pullback, like choosing to forgo any rate increases altogether until a later meeting, would bring its own risks of signaling to the market that there are deeper systemic problems."
1017,It’s a conundrum top Fed officials started grappling with in the first of their two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.
1018,How they choose to navigate the path ahead will remain behind closed doors until their policy statement is released Wednesday afternoon.
1019,Powell is scheduled to speak to reporters shortly after.
1020,"For officials inside the Biden White House, Wednesday is poised to offer critical insight into how the central bank is grappling with its urgent priority of bringing down inflation, while at the same time, minimizing the risk of additional dominoes falling in the US banking sector."
1021,"Those two imperatives – bringing prices down and maintaining stability across the US financial sector – are urgent priorities for the Biden White House, particularly as the president moves closer to a widely expected reelection announcement and the health of the economy remains the top issue for voters."
1022,Yet the Fed’s decision will come at a moment of accelerating political pressure on the Fed itself – and Powell specifically.
1023,"Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Powell, saying he has failed at two of his main jobs, citing raising interest rates and his support of bank deregulation."
1024,"“I opposed Chair Powell for his initial nomination, but his re-nomination."
1025,"I opposed him because of his views on regulation and what he was doing to weaken regulation, but I think he’s failing in both jobs, both as oversight manager of these big banks which is his job and also what he’s doing with inflation,” Warren said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
 White House officials have made clear – with no hesitation – that Biden’s long-stated confidence in Powell is unchanged."
1026,"Powell, who was confirmed for his second four-year term as Fed chair last year, announced last week that the Fed would launch a review into the failure of Silicon Valley Bank."
1027,"Treasury and Fed officials, along with counterparts at other federal regulators and their international counterparts, have continued regular discussions this week as they’ve monitored the system in the wake of the weekend collapse, and eventual sale, of European banking giant Credit Suisse."
1028,"US officials viewed the Credit Suisse collapse as unrelated to the crisis that took down the US banks a weekend prior, although they acknowledged it posed broader risks tied to confidence, or the potential lack thereof, in the system."
1029,"In recent days, White House officials have begun to cautiously suggest that they see signs of the US banking sector stabilizing, following the turbulent aftermath of the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank."
1030,"Biden, for his part, has credited the sweeping steps his administration announced – namely, the backstopping of all depositors’ funds held at the two institutions and the creation of an emergency lending program by the Federal Reserve – as having prevented a broader financial meltdown."
1031,"He has also called on US regulators and lawmakers to strengthen financial regulations, though it is not yet clear what specific actions the president may ultimately throw his weight behind."
1032,Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment Tuesday afternoon at the White House press briefing on how she and other officials were watching the Fed’s upcoming decision.
1033,“The Fed is indeed independent.
1034,"We want to give them the space to make those monetary decisions and I don’t want to get ahead of that,” Jean-Pierre said."
1035,"“I don’t even want to give any thoughts to what Jerome Powell might say tomorrow.”

1249,The Federal Reserve has a tall task on Wednesday.
1250,"The central bank must convince investors it is serious about two obvious problems, each of which suggests an equal and opposite solution."
1251,"On the one hand, the Fed is facing inflation that remains, to use their own words, ""too high."""
1252,"Consumer prices rose 6% over the prior year in February which, while marking the slowest annual increase since Sept. 2021, is still three times higher than the Fed's 2% target."
1253,"For central bankers, higher inflation has a clear response: raise interest rates."
1254,"And investors expect this process to continue on Wednesday, with investors pricing in an 85% chance the Fed raises rates by 0.25%, according to data from the CME Group."
1255,"On the other hand, the Fed is facing a banking crisis that is, in part, traceable back to its own actions to choke off inflation."
1256,"Since the beginning of March, three U.S. banks have failed and others — most notably California-based First Republic (FRC) — are teetering on the edge amid deposit outflows."
1257,"All else equal, in a banking crisis investors would expect the Fed to cut rates to ease pressure on the financial system."
1258,"As one strategist told Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger earlier this week, this conundrum finds the Fed ""between a rock and a hard place."""
1259,"Which likely understates the magnitude of the central bank's problem, a problem which calls for clear and obvious answers that are clear and obvious opposites."
1260,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, in Hart Building on Tuesday, March 7, 2023."

 Now, interest rates are only one tool available to the Fed at any point in time."
1262,"More amorphous concepts like ""forward guidance"" or more esoteric — though concrete — solutions like swap lines and term funding programs are available to the Fed."
1263,"Story continues
 The latter have been stood up in recent weeks to ease strain on the financial system."
1264,The former will feature during Powell's press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
1265,"""The Fed faces a tough decision this week and an even more challenging communication challenge because of the stress in the banking system,"" wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients this week."
1266,"""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."""
1267,"The problem with this setup for the Fed, of course, is that when leaders in a crisis say the answer is ""both"" what most people hear is ""neither."""
1268,"Since 1977, the Federal Reserve has worked to fulfill a ""dual mandate"" of achieving maximum employment and stable prices."
1269,"As an organization, we could say the Fed has indeed been in service to two leaders."
1270,Critics will note this sits at the heart of the Fed's shortcoming.
1271,"But as Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman wrote Tuesday morning, the Fed must now also consider its so-called ""third mandate"" of maintaining financial stability."
1272,As The Office once asked its audience: What great organization doesn't have two leaders?

 There is widespread uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates as the banking industry teeters."
1275,"“It’s a coin toss now,” one strategist said."
1276,"Reeling from the collapse of banks that prompted intervention from authorities around the world and generated violent swings in financial markets, investors, analysts and economists are sure of nothing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates on Wednesday."
1277,"Futures on the S&P 500, which give investors the ability to bet on the stock market before the official start of trading, were down slightly."
1278,Stocks in Europe and Asia mostly posted small gains.
1279,"The muted moves reflected widespread uncertainty about the outcome of the Fed’s meeting, with expectations upended by the crisis in the banking sector."
1280,"“We still don’t know what is going to happen,” said Max Gokhman, an investment strategist at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions."
1281,"“It presents a risk that there will be a much bigger move in markets after the announcement.”
 
 
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates slightly, but its path is uncertain as worries plague the banking system."
1282,"Just two weeks ago, Federal Reserve officials were hinting that they might consider a large, half-point rate increase at the conclusion of their meeting on Wednesday as the economy showed sustained momentum."
1283,A series of bank failures since then have not only convinced investors and Wall Street economists that policymakers will lift borrowing costs by just a quarter-point on Wednesday — some are questioning whether central bankers will raise them at all.
1284,"Investors are most heavily betting on a quarter-point increase, but are penciling in a chance that the Fed will pause what has been a steady campaign to raise borrowing costs to contain rapid inflation."
1285,"Goldman Sachs economists think it is likely that central bankers will hold off on a rate move this month, before resuming them in May."
1286,This Fed decision carries enormously high stakes.
1287,"If investors believe that central bankers are not sufficiently attuned to the turmoil gripping the banking industry, jittery markets could recoil."
1288,"Yet if officials pause their rate increases to allow the tumult to pass, they could appear to be giving up on their fight against still-rapid inflation."
