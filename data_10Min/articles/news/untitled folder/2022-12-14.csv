 The Federal Reserve reinforced its inflation fight Wednesday by raising its key interest rate for the seventh time this year and signaling more hikes to come."
28,But the Fed announced a smaller hike than it had in its past four meetings at a time when inflation is showing signs of easing.
29,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve reinforced its inflation fight Wednesday by raising its key interest rate for the seventh time this year and signaling more hikes to come.
30,But the Fed announced a smaller hike than it had in its past four meetings at a time when inflation is showing signs of easing.
31,"The Fed boosted its benchmark rate a half-point to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, its highest level in 15 years."
32,"Though smaller than its previous three-quarter-point hikes, the latest move will further heighten the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession."
33,The policymakers also forecast that their key short-term rate will reach a range of 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023.
34,That suggests that the Fed is prepared to raise its benchmark rate by an additional three-quarters of a point and leave it there until the end of next year.
35,Some economists had expected that they would project only an additional half-point increase.
36,The central bank’s latest rate hike was announced one day after an encouraging report showed that inflation in the United States slowed in November for a fifth straight month.
37,"The year-over-year increase of 7.1%, though still high, was sharply below a recent peak of 9.1% in June."
38,Fed officials have indicated that they see some evidence of progress in their drive to defeat the worst inflation bout in four decades and to bring inflation back down to their 2% annual target.
39,"The national average for a gallon of regular gas, for example, has tumbled from $5 in June to $3.21."
40,"Many supply chains have unraveled, helping reduce goods prices."
41,"The better-than-expected November inflation data showed that the prices of used cars, furniture and toys all declined last month."
42,So did the costs of services from hotels to airfares to car rentals.
43,"Rental and home prices are falling, too, though those declines have yet to feed into the government’s data."
44,"And one measure the Fed tracks closely — “core” prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs for a clearer snapshot of underlying inflation — rose only slightly for a second straight month."
45,"Inflation has also eased slightly in Europe and the United Kingdom, leading analysts to expect the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to slow their pace of rate hikes at their meetings Thursday."
46,Both are expected to raise rates by half a point to target still painfully high prices spikes after big three-quarter-point increases.
47,"Inflation in the 19 countries using the euro currency fell to 10% from 10.6% in October, the first decline since June 2021."
48,The rate is so far above the bank’s 2% goal that rate hikes are expected to continue into next year.
49,Britain’s inflation also eased from a 41-year record of 11.1% in October to a still-high 10.7% in November.
50,"At the Fed, Chair Jerome Powell has made clear that the central bank isn’t close to declaring victory over high inflation."
51,Fed officials will likely want to see further moderate inflation readings before they would be comfortable suspending their rate hikes.
52,One reason for caution is that inflation gauges can sometimes reignite after initially slowing.
53,"In 2021, for example, core price increases slowed for a couple of months in the summer before accelerating again and reaching new heights."
54,"Cumulatively, the Fed’s hikes have led to much costlier borrowing rates for consumers as well as companies, ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans."
55,"The hikes have sent home sales plummeting and are starting to reduce rents on new apartments, a leading source of high inflation."
56,The officials have said they want rates to reach “restrictive” levels that slow growth and hiring and bring inflation down to their annual target of 2%.
57,Worries have grown that the Fed is raising rates so much in its drive to curb inflation that it will trigger a recession next year.
58,The policymakers have stressed that more important than how fast they raise rates is how long they keep them at or near their peak.
59,Wall Street investors are betting that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates before the end of next year.
60,"Housing costs, which make up nearly a third of the consumer price index, are still rising."
61,But real-time measures of apartment rents and home prices are starting to drop after having posted sizzling price acceleration at the height of the pandemic.
62,Powell said those declines will likely emerge in government data next year and should help reduce overall inflation.
63,"Powell’s biggest focus has been on services, which he said are likely to stay persistently high."
64,"In part, that’s because sharp increases in wages are becoming a key contributor to inflation."
65,"Services companies, like hotels and restaurants, are particularly labor-intensive."
66,"And with average wages growing at a brisk 5%-6% a year, price pressures keep building in that sector of the economy."
67,How the Fed will slow a robust labor market to help tame inflation could prove perilous.
68,Powell and other Fed officials have said they hope their rate hikes will slow both consumer spending and job growth.
69,"Businesses would then remove many of their job openings, reducing the demand for labor."
70,"With less competition for workers, wages could begin to grow more slowly."
71,The Federal Reserve's final policy meeting of 2022 is expected to see the central bank raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.50%.
72,"The Federal Reserve is expected to slow the pace of its aggressive interest rate hike campaign this afternoon, as consumer prices have shown signs of cooling for two straight months."
73,"The central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a new range of 4.25% and 4.5%, marking the highest level since December 2007."
74,The Fed will announce its policy decision at 2 p.m.
75,"ET, followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m."
76,ET.
77,"This move will usher in a slower phase of rate hikes after the central bank, which has raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.75% at each of its last four policy meetings."
78,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference after Powell announced the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point as part of their continuing efforts to combat inflation, following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., November 2, 2022."

81,"Investors will also get a new set of estimates on the Fed’s outlook for inflation, GDP, and unemployment."

 Yet with price increases still uncomfortably high — inflation was 7.1% in November compared with a year earlier — Powell and other Fed officials have underscored that they expect to keep rates at their peak for an extended period."
121,"With inflation pressures now easing, though, most economists think the Fed will further slow its hikes and raise its key rate by just a quarter-point at its next meeting early next year."
122,"“The data (Tuesday) kind of fits with our idea that the Fed will downshift further in February,” said Matthew Luzzetti, an economist at Deutsche Bank and a former research analyst at the Fed."
123,"“Downshifting helps to maximize their prospects of a soft landing,” in which the Fed’s rate hikes would slow growth and tame inflation but not tip the economy into a recession."
124,"On Wednesday, members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee will also update their projections for interest rates and other economic barometers for 2023 and beyond."
125,"Most analysts have forecast that they will pencil in a peak range of at least 4.75% to 5%, or even 5% to 5.25%, up from their September forecast of 4.5% to 4.75%."
126,Despite Powell’s recent hard-line remarks — he said late last month that “we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation” — he and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re ready to dial down the pace of rate hikes.
127,"In doing so, they will have time to assess the impact of the increases they’ve already imposed."
128,"Those hikes have sent home sales plummeting and are starting to reduce rents on new apartments, a leading source of high inflation."
129,Fed officials have also said they want rates to reach “restrictive” levels that slow growth and hiring and bring inflation down to the their annual target of 2%.
130,"“What policy rate is sufficiently restrictive we will only learn over time by watching how the economy evolves,” said Lisa Cook, one of seven members of the Fed’s Board of Governors."

 Fed officials have stressed that more important than how fast they raise rates is how long they keep them at or near their peak."

 In remarks late last month, Powell said he was tracking price trends in three different categories to best understand the likely path of inflation: Goods, excluding volatile food and energy costs; housing, which includes rents and the cost of homeownership; and services excluding housing, such as auto insurance, pet services and education."
135,"In his speech, Powell noted that there had been some progress in easing inflation in goods and housing but not so in most services."
136,"Some of those trends extended into last month’s data, with goods prices, excluding food and energy, falling 0.5% from October to November, the second straight monthly drop."

214,"That middle, or median, official is regularly quoted as the clearest estimate of where the central bank sees policy heading."

217,"In June, the median official expected interest rates to close out the year at a range of 3.25 to 3.5 percent — instead, they’ll be set to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent if policymakers lift rates as much as expected on Wednesday."
218,"The median official expected rates to climb to 4.6 percent in 2023 as of the last rate projections in September, but that projection is expected to tick up slightly in the new release."
219,"Still, central bankers are likely to project that they are near the end of the road when it comes to raising interest rates."
220,"They have already done a lot to cool the economy, and they do not want to overdo it and crush growth and the labor market more than is necessary."
221,The most important trick for reading this dot plot?
222,Pay attention to where the numbers fall in relation to the longer-run median projection.
223,"That number is sometimes called the natural rate, and it most recently stood at 2.5 percent."
224,It represents the theoretical dividing line between easy and restrictive monetary policy.
225,The Fed can use the gap between the Fed funds rate and that so-called natural rate to signal how far they plan to go into economy-restricting territory — and also how long they will stay there.
226,How long rates will stay elevated is a particularly important question at this moment.
227,"Unemployment projections will be key
 Is the Fed expecting a much-higher jobless rate as it tries to counter rapid inflation?"
228,Page 2 of the economic projections will hold some answers.
229,The Fed has two jobs.
230,It is supposed to achieve maximum employment and stable inflation.
231,"Unemployment has been very low, employers are hiring steadily, and wages have been rapid throughout 2022, so officials think that their full employment goal is more than satisfied."
232,"Inflation, on the other hand, is running at about three times their official target."
233,"Given that, the central bankers are now single-mindedly focused on bringing price gains back under control."
234,"But once the job market slows, joblessness begins to rise and wage growth moderates — a series of events officials think is necessary to getting back to slow and steady price gains — the difficult phase of the Fed’s maneuvering will begin."
235,"Central bankers will have to decide how much joblessness they are willing to tolerate, and may have to judge how to balance two goals that are in conflict."
236,"Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has at times acknowledged that the adjustment process is likely to bring “pain” to businesses and households."
237,The Fed’s updated unemployment rate projections will show how much he and his colleagues are prepared to tolerate.
238,"Watch the growth outlook
 The road toward higher unemployment is paved with slower growth."
239,"To force the job market to cool and inflation to moderate, Fed officials believe they have to drag economic growth below its potential level — and how much it is expected to drop can send a signal about how punishing the Fed thinks its policies will be."
240,"Many experts think that the economy is capable of a certain level of growth in any given year, based on fundamental characteristics like the age of its population and productivity of its companies."
241,"Right now, the Fed estimates that longer-run sustainable level to be about 1.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation."
242,"Last year, the economy was growing much more strongly than that — it began overheating."
243,"This year, growth was much weaker."
244,The question is how tepid the Fed thinks it needs to be in 2023 to help policymakers achieve their inflation goal.
245,"Pro tip: Interpret inflation estimates cautiously
 The inflation estimates in the Fed’s projections typically do not offer a lot of insight."
246,That’s because the Fed’s forecasts predict how the economy will shape up if central bankers set what they consider “appropriate” monetary policy.
247,"To qualify as “appropriate,” by definition, monetary policy must push price increases back toward the Fed’s 2 percent annual average goal over the course of a few years."
248,That means Fed inflation forecasts always converge back toward the central bank’s goal in economic estimates.
249,"If there is a glimmer of utility here, it is how long the central bank sees it taking to wrestle prices back to its target level."
250,"As of September, Fed officials thought that core inflation — the figure that strips out food and fuel costs to get a sense of underlying price patterns — would remain at 2.1 percent in 2025."
251,The upshot?
252,"It could be a long road back to normal, even in an ideal world."
253,Bank of America screened for stocks hurt by rising interest rates.
254,"If the Fed dials back, they could benefit."
255,"The stock market has been under pressure from the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, but some names have been hit harder than others — and could be poised to rebound."
256,The central bank is expected to hike rates by another 50 basis points on Wednesday in its effort to combat inflation.
257,"However, investors will be listening closely for any signals that it will scale back, especially since consumer prices rose less than expected in November."
258,"If the Fed implies it will ease its inflation fight, and the 10-year Treasury yield keeps pulling back, then stocks that were the hardest hit from rate increases could benefit."
259,"Bank of America recently screened for S & P 500 stocks with the lowest nominal interest rate betas, meaning they are hurt by rising nominal interest rates."
260,The screen is based on a regression of the stocks' monthly excess returns versus the monthly changes in the 10-year Treasury yield from 1972 through November of this year.
261,"Here are 10 of those names, all rated a buy from Bank of America."
262,"Take-Two Interactive Software , which has a nominal interest rate beta of -7.6, has lost more than 40% this year."
263,"In November, the gaming company said its outlook in the current quarter and for fiscal 2023 would be lower than previously expected."
264,"It now expects fiscal 2023 net bookings to come in between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion, versus its previous expectation of $5.77 billion at the midpoint."
265,"In addition to the buy rating from Bank of America, Cowen recently named Take-Two as a top 2023 pick based on the company's ""long-term track record."""
266,"Also on the list is Ventas , a real estate investment trust operating in the health care space."
267,It has lost about 9% year to date and has a nominal interest rate beta of -6.3.
268,"REITs overall have been hit this year by rising interest rates, since investors who have them for their high dividend yields may ditch the assets for risk-free Treasurys."
269,"However, Morningstar senior equity analyst Kevin Brown recently told CNBC that Ventas could benefit from the aging population with its exposure to senior housing."
270,"Meanwhile, Chipotle Mexican Grill has a nominal interest rate beta of -5.8 and has lost more than 11% so far this year."
271,"The restaurant chain reported quarterly earnings in October that topped expectations , with CEO Brian Niccol saying there has been ""minimal resistance"" to higher menu prices."
272,"In the utility space, Duke Energy has a -2.8 beta and has lost about 2% this year, through Tuesday's close."
273,"In November, the energy company reported an earnings miss, with its third-quarter earnings-per-share coming in at $1.78 versus StreetAccount's estimate of $1.84."
274,"However, revenue came in at $7.97 billion, above the $7.39 billion expected."
275,"Lastly, Pfizer made the list, with a -2.8 beta."
276,The stock is down about 10% year to date.
277,"In November, the pharma giant reported an earnings and revenue beat for the third quarter."
278,"In addition to Bank of America's buy rating, the stock was also upgraded recently by Goldman Sachs to buy from neutral."

317,"Christopher Rugaber, The Associated Press
 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve reinforced its inflation fight Wednesday by raising its key interest rate for the seventh time this year and signaling more hikes to come."
318,But the Fed announced a smaller hike than it had in its past four meetings at a time when inflation is showing signs of easing.
319,"The Fed boosted its benchmark rate a half-point to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, its highest level in 15 years."
320,"Though lower than its previous three-quarter-point hikes, the latest move will further increase the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession."
321,The policymakers also forecast that their key short-term rate will reach a range of 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2023.
322,That suggests that the Fed is prepared to raise its benchmark rate by an additional three-quarters of a point and leave it there through next year.
323,Some economists had expected that the Fed would project only an additional half-point increase.
324,The prospect of higher-than-expected borrowing rates disappointed Wall Street.
325,Investors immediately sent stock prices falling.
326,The latest rate hike was announced one day after an encouraging report showed that inflation in the United States slowed in November for a fifth straight month.
327,"The year-over-year increase of 7.1%, though still high, was sharply below a recent peak of 9.1% in June."
328,"“The inflation data in October and November show a welcome reduction,” Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference."
329,"“But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.”
 In its updated forecasts, the Fed's policymakers predicted slower growth and higher unemployment for next year and 2024."
330,"The unemployment rate is envisioned to jump to 4.6% by the end of 2023, from 3.7% today."
331,That would mark a significant increase in joblessness that typically would reflect a recession.
332,"Consistent with a sharp slowdown, the officials also projected that the economy will barely grow next year, expanding just 0.5%, less than half the forecast it had made in September."
333,"In recent weeks, Fed officials have indicated that they see some evidence of progress in their drive to defeat the worst inflation bout in four decades and to bring inflation back down to their 2% annual target."
334,"The national average for a gallon of regular gas, for example, has tumbled from $5 in June to $3.21."
335,"Many supply chains are no longer clogged, thereby helping reduce goods prices."
336,"The better-than-expected November inflation data showed that the prices of used cars, furniture and toys all declined last month."
337,So did the costs of services from hotels to airfares to car rentals.
338,"Rental and home prices are falling, too, though those declines have yet to feed into the government's data."
339,"And one measure the Fed tracks closely - “core” prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs for a clearer snapshot of underlying inflation - rose only slightly for a second straight month."
340,"Inflation has also eased slightly in Europe and the United Kingdom, leading analysts to expect the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to slow their pace of rate hikes at their meetings Thursday."
341,Both are expected to raise rates by half a point to target still painfully high prices spikes after big three-quarter-point increases.
342,"Inflation in the 19 countries using the euro currency fell to 10% from 10.6% in October, the first decline since June 2021."
343,The rate is so far above the bank's 2% goal that rate hikes are expected to continue into next year.
344,Britain's inflation also eased from a 41-year record of 11.1% in October to a still-high 10.7% in November.
345,"At the Fed, Powell has made clear that the central bank isn't close to declaring victory over high inflation."
346,Fed officials will likely want to see further moderate inflation readings before they would be comfortable suspending their rate hikes.
347,One reason for caution is that inflation gauges can sometimes reignite after initially slowing.
348,"In 2021, for example, core price increases slowed for a couple of months in the summer before accelerating again and reaching new heights."
349,"Cumulatively, the Fed's hikes have led to much costlier borrowing rates for consumers as well as companies, ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans."
350,"The hikes have sent home sales plummeting and are starting to reduce rents on new apartments, a leading source of high inflation."
351,The officials have said they want rates to reach “restrictive” levels that slow growth and hiring and bring inflation down to their annual target of 2%.
352,Worries have grown that the Fed is raising rates so much in its drive to curb inflation that it will trigger a recession next year.
353,The policymakers have stressed that more important than how fast they raise rates is how long they keep them at or near their peak.
354,Wall Street investors are betting that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates before the end of next year.
355,"Powell's biggest focus has been on services prices, which he has said are likely to stay persistently high."
356,"In part, that's because sharp increases in wages are becoming a key contributor to inflation."
357,"Services companies, like hotels and restaurants, are particularly labor-intensive."
358,"And with average wages growing at a brisk 5%-6% a year, price pressures keep building in that sector of the economy."

 The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating that the fight against inflation is not over yet."
680,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating that the fight against inflation is not over yet despite some promising signs lately."
681,"Keeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%."
682,"The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s."
683,"Along with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024."
684,"The expected ""terminal rate,"" or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC's ""dot plot"" of individual members' expectations."

687,"Investors reacted negatively to the expectation that rates may stay higher for longer, and stocks gave up earlier gains."
688,"The new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression."
689,"This time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023."
690,"Members penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25."
691,"At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of the monetary policy tightening make its way through the economy."
692,"The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year."
693,"That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%."
694,"However, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s."
695,The newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024.
696,"For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members – voters and nonvoters included – saw rates rising above 5.25%."
697,"Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024."
698,"The FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November's meeting."
699,"Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees ""ongoing increases"" ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement."
700,"Fed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years."
701,"The FOMC lowered its growth targets for 2023, putting expected GDP gains at just 0.5%, barely above what would be considered a recession."
702,The GDP outlook for this year also was put at 0.5%.
703,"In the September projections, the committee expected 0.2% growth this year and 1.2% next."
704,"The committee also raised its median anticipation of its favored core inflation measure to 4.8%, up 0.3 percentage points from the September outlook."
705,Members slightly lowered their unemployment rate outlook for this year and bumped it a bit higher for the ensuing years.
706,The rate hike follows consecutive reports showing progress in the inflation fight.
707,"The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in November, a smaller increase than expected as the 12-month rate dropped to 7.1%."
708,"Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rate was at 6%."
709,Both measures were the lowest since December 2021.
710,"A level the Fed puts more weight on, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, fell to a 5% annual rate in October."

712,Officials have stressed the need to see consistent declines in inflation and have warned against relying too much on trends over just a few months.
713,"Central bankers still feel they have leeway to raise rates, as hiring remains strong and consumers, who drive about two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, are continuing to spend."
714,"Nonfarm payrolls grew by a faster than expected 263,000 in November, while the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter."
715,"Retail sales grew 1.3% in October and were up 8.3% on an annual basis, indicating that consumers so far are weathering the inflation storm."
716,"Inflation came about from a convergence of at least three factors: Outsized demand for goods during the pandemic that created severe supply chain issues, Russia's invasion of Ukraine that coincided with a spike in energy prices, and trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus that created a glut of dollars looking for a place to go."
717,"After spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as ""transitory,"" the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments."
718,"Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years."
719,"The Fed also has been engaged in ""quantitative tightening,"" a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them."

 Particularly in light of Tuesday's softer-than-expected consumer price index inflation report, it would be a shock if the FOMC does anything other than raises the fed funds rate a half point, taking the overnight borrowing benchmark to a targeted range of 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years."
811,"While the committee vote is likely to be unanimous or close to it, not everyone is on board."
812,"""I'm hoping Jay Powell will stand firm and continue to do what needs to be done,"" said former FDIC Chairman William Isaac."
813,"""I'm hoping they go up at least a point."""
814,Then there's the other side.
815,"""This hiking cycle should be over right now,"" wrote Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets."
816,"""We have been fond of saying over recent months that the Fed is fighting yesterday's war on inflation ..."
817,"There is no need at this point to continue hiking rates but, of course, they will."""
818,"Communications
 Behind that unanimous or near-unanimous vote on rates will be a vigorous debate on where monetary policy should go from here."
819,That should be reflected in both the post-meeting statement and in Powell's news conference.
820,"One area where markets are looking for change is in phrasing saying the FOMC ""anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate"" to something more generic like ""some increases"" could be needed."
821,"That gives the Fed flexibility for its next move, with some in the markets anticipating that February could be the last rate hike for a while."
822,The Fed's next rate decision after this one is due Feb. 1.
823,Powell will be looked at to bring clarity to where the committee views the future of its inflation fight.
824,"""Traders will be closely monitoring Jay Powell's Q&A as we seek guidance on February potentially only being a 25 [basis point] increase and what the FOMC's plan is to get to a higher terminal rate yet over a longer period,"" said Victor Masotti, director of repo trading at Clear Street."
825,"The 'dot plot' and the 'terminal rate'
 That ""terminal rate"" of which Masotti spoke references the expected end point for the Fed and its current-rate hiking cycle."
826,"When the Fed last updated its dot plot — a chart in which each FOMC member gets an anonymous ""dot"" to project rate moves over the next few years — the terminal rate was pegged at 4.6%."
827,"With inflation still rising, notwithstanding recent reports, the endpoint is likely to grow as well."
828,But perhaps not by as much as market feared.
829,"Goldman Sachs said it's ""a close call between 5-5.25% and a smaller rise to 4.75-5%."
830,We continue to expect three 25bp hikes in 2023.
831,"At the margin, [Tuesday's CPI] report reduces the risk of a 50bp hike in February."""
832,"Signaling a softer approach could be dangerous, said Isaac, who was FDIC chair back in the early 1980s when inflation was raging and then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker had to raise rates dramatically and pull the economy into recession."
833,"""People have to have confidence in the Fed, and that's what Volcker brought."
834,"You knew he meant what he said,"" said Isaac, chairman of Secura/Isaac Group, a global advisory firm."

 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by half a point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, an indication that the central bank is pulling back on its aggressive stance as signs begin to emerge that inflation may be easing."
944,"Washington, DC CNN —
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by half a point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, an indication that the central bank is pulling back on its aggressive stance as signs begin to emerge that inflation may be easing."
945,"Although that increase would be smaller than the three-quarter-point hikes announced at the past four Fed meetings, it’s nothing to scoff at."
946,"It’s still double the Fed’s customary quarter-point hike, and a sizable increase that will likely cause economic pain for millions of American businesses and households by pushing up the cost of borrowing for homes, cars and other loans."
947,"The Fed’s anticipated action would increase the rate that banks charge each other for overnight borrowing to a range of between 4.25% and 4.5%, the highest since 2007."
948,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed last month that smaller rate hikes could be expected, saying: “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”
 The latest inflation reading, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, showed year-on-year price increases slowed to 7.1% in November."
949,"But inflation is unlikely to slow dramatically any time soon, partly due to continued pressure on wages amid a shortage of workers."
950,"Yet Wall Street appears to believe the Fed will eventually be forced to pivot away from, or even reverse its regimen of rate hikes."
951,Traders are largely pricing in rate cuts in the second half of 2023.
952,"The Fed will conclude its rate hike regimen by the second quarter of next year, predicted JPMorgan analysts in a recent note."
953,"“With inflation continuing to fade and fiscal policy likely on hold, the Fed is likely to end its tightening cycle early in the new year and inflation could begin to ease before the end of 2023,” they wrote."
954,The analysts expect two quarter-point hikes in the first half of 2023.
955,"But the average period between peak interest rates and the first reductions by the Fed is 11 months, which could mean that even if the central bank stops actively hiking rates, they could remain elevated into 2024."
956,"Investors will closely read the Fed’s economic outlook, the Summary of Economic Projections, which is also due out Wednesday."
957,And they will watch Powell’s press conferences for clues about what’s to come — though they may end up sorely disappointed.
958,"​”We expect Fed Chair Powell will insist on the need to hold policy at a restrictive level for some time to bring inflation down toward the 2% target,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, in a note to clients Monday."
959,"“This will serve to push back against current market pricing … Powell will stress that history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.”
 What about the famous soft landing?"
960,"The Fed has increased its benchmark lending rate six times this year in an attempt to discourage borrowing, cool the economy and bring down historically high inflation that peaked at 9.1% over the summer."
961,"Even if interest rate hikes do ease off, they will remain high, and economists are largely expecting that the US economy will endure a recession next year."
962,"Powell said in November that there is still a chance the economy avoids recession but the odds are slim, noting: “To the extent we need to keep rates higher longer, that’s going to narrow the path to a soft landing.”
 In an interview that aired on CBS on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — Powell’s predecessor at the Fed — said there is “a risk of a recession."
963,"But it certainly isn’t, in my view, something that is necessary to bring inflation down.”
 And the economy has so far withstood the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes."
964,"The job market is healthy, wages are growing, Americans are spending and GDP is strong."
965,Business is also good: Companies are largely beating revenue expectations and reporting positive earnings results.
966,"A global problem
 The Fed isn’t acting alone, it’s just one of nine central banks expected to make a rate announcement this week."
967,Landing softly on the ever-narrowing path between high inflation and recession is a global concern as central banks across the world contend with similar economic problems.
968,"The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are expected to follow the United States with half-point moves of their own on Thursday."
969,"Norway, Mexico, Taiwan, Colombia and the Philippines will also likely increase their borrowing costs this week."
970,"The Federal Reserve announces its rate hike decision Wednesday at 2 p.m., followed by a press conference with Chair Powell at 2:30 p.m.

974,Official consumer prices data on Wednesday showed UK inflation falling more sharply than expected in November to 10.7% from October's 41-year high of 11.1%.
975,"""The picture is still consistent with what the Bank of England (BoE) told us when they last met, which was that the peak in inflation would probably be around 11% in October,"" said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets."
976,Sterling was virtually flat versus the euro at 85.985 pence.
977,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the inflation rate would slip to 10.9%.
978,"Both U.S. and euro zone inflation, too, have dropped more steeply than expected last month, raising hopes that the current wave of inflation may have peaked."
979,"The market is looking ahead to the BoE's interest rate decision on Thursday, with traders placing a 70% chance of a 50 basis points (bps) increase to the bank rate."
980,"""The question is how the BoE responds tomorrow,"" said Cole."
981,"""What markets will be looking at is, if we get the 50 bps hike that is expected, how much dissent there was around that?"""
982,"British policymakers have been hiking rates since late 2021 to try to bring down double-digit inflation, but are increasingly split on how much tightening is needed as the economy heads into recession."
983,The latest inflation figures may support the idea that tightening should slow down.
984,"""We think over the next three or four months, the pendulum is likely to swing towards the weak growth background if inflation keeps coming down."
985,"Today is a strong case for them pausing well before the market expects,"" said Cole, who takes a negative view on the pound in the short and long term."
986,"Official data on Monday showed Britain's economy rebounding in October
 , but the outlook for Britain's economy remains murky and fears of a deep recession continue to weigh on traders' minds."
987,"The pound touched $1.2345 against the dollar on Dec. 5 - its highest since mid-June - recovering by nearly 20% from a record low at the end of September, but remains 8.4% lower in 2022."
988,(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
989,"Central bankers are still fighting inflation, but are poised to slow to a rate increase of half a percentage point at their final meeting of 2022."
990,"Federal Reserve officials appear poised to finish the most inflationary year since the 1980s on an optimistic note: They are expected to slow their campaign to cool the economy at their meeting on Wednesday, just as incoming data offer reasons to hope that price increases will fade next year."
991,Central bankers are expected to lift interest rates by half a percentage point to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent.
992,"That would be a slowdown from their past four meetings, where they raised rates in three-quarter-point increments."
993,"Officials will also release a fresh set of economic projections, their first since September, which will offer a glimpse at how high they expect rates to rise in 2023 and how long they plan to hold them there."
994,"Fed policymakers have lifted borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades this year to slow demand in the economy, hoping to tamp down inflationary pressures and prevent rapid increases from becoming a permanent feature of the American economy."
995,"While inflation is now showing signs of slowing, it remains much faster than usual, and central bankers have made clear that they have more work to do in ensuring that it returns to normal."
