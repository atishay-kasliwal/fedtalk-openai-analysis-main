U.S. stocks on Wednesday traded near the flatline, as investors refrained from big moves ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision in the afternoon.
Market participants received further economic data that showed a cooling in producer inflation. Treasury yields slid after the figures and amid expectations for a pause in rate hikes.
By mid-day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) had added 0.39% to 13,626.80 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) had risen 0.31% to 4,382.72 points. The Dow (DJI) was under pressure, falling 0.30% to 34,111.04 points. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a slump in shares of UnitedHealth (UNH).
All 11 S&P sectors were trading in the green, with the exception of Health Care and Energy. Utilities and Technology topped the leaderboard.
Wall Street's major averages have posted gains in the last two sessions in the runup to the Fed's meeting, with the benchmark S&P (SP500) hitting fresh 52-week closing highs. Sentiment yesterday was helped by a moderation in consumer inflation in May.
"Investor risk appetite has remained pretty strong over the last 24 hours, with the S&P 500 (SP500) hitting a fresh one-year high and posting a 4th consecutive advance," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said. "This optimism was evident across multiple asset classes, with oil prices rising and credit spreads tightening as well. But the flip side of all this positivity has been growing skepticism that central banks will cut rates at all this year, which led to a sovereign bond selloff as investors priced in higher rates for longer."
On Wednesday, the producer price index (PPI) report for May came in, with the headline number falling more than expected on a M/M basis and trailing the consensus on a Y/Y basis.
"The core (PPI) rate dipped to 2.8% in May from 3.2% in April and 8.6% in May last year, so the downward trend in the headline is not just a story of falling food and energy prices," Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson said.
"The pace of margin compression is uneven and the past couple months have been disappointing, but the big picture is intact: Slowing demand growth for goods, coupled with the dramatic turnaround in supply chains, means that gross margins cannot be sustained at their pandemic-boosted level. Margin re-compression over the next year will exert intense downward pressure on core PCE inflation and the GDP deflator, as well as the PPI," Shepherdson added.
The central bank will release its policy decision later today at 1400 ET, followed by chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 1430 ET. The expectation is for the Fed to keep rates steady but signal a hike at the July meeting.
Treasury yields fell after the inflation data and amid the anticipation of no rate hike. The longer-end 10-year yield (US10Y) was down 5 basis points to 3.79% while the 2-year yield (US2Y) - which is more rate-sensitive to the Fed's moves - was down 8 basis points to 4.62%. Meanwhile, the dollar index (DXY) was lower by 0.61% to 102.71.
Turning to active stocks, UnitedHealth (UNH) stock slipped more than 7% and weighed on other managed care providers after the company warned that its medical care ratio - a key metric for health insurers - would come under pressure in Q2.
More on the markets and Fed day


Thats when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates after jacking them to their highest levels since 2007 in hopes of getting high inflation under control.The wide expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will make no move, which would be the first time in more than a year where it hasnt raised rates.
Stocks are drifting Wednesday, as Wall Street waits to hear what the Federal Reserve's latest economy-moving decision will be on interest rates.
The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher in morning trading after riding a winning streak to its best level since April 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 89 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 34,123, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.2 per cent higher.
Some stocks were making sharp moves, including drops for several health insurers after UnitedHealth Group flagged how many customers were getting knee procedures and other outpatient services done. That's something that could raise costs for insurers, and UnitedHealth fell 6.9 per cent. Humana dropped 11.6 per cent.
Stocks of companies that make products used in hip replacements and other health procedures, meanwhile, were at the front of the market. Stryker rose 4.8 per cent per cent, and Boston Scientific gained 3.9 per cent.
But the majority of Wall Street was quiet, with the main event coming later in the afternoon. That's when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates after jacking them to their highest levels since 2007 in hopes of getting high inflation under control.
The wide expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will make no move, which would be the first time in more than a year where it hasn't raised rates. Inflation has come down since its peak last summer, and a report Wednesday morning showed price gains at the wholesale level eased in May to the most modest inflation from year-earlier levels since 2020.
Hikes to interest rates take a notoriously long time to take effect, and they can do so in unanticipated and damaging ways. Already, they've helped lead to three high-profile failures in the US banking system, a monthslong contraction in the manufacturing industry and worries about a possible recession.
But many on Wall Street don't expect this to be the end to the Fed's rate hikes. The widespread bet is that it will resume raising rates in July.
Even if it's come down, inflation is still too high for comfort. It's hurting all kinds of households, particularly those with lower incomes. It's also giving ammunition to the members of the Fed considered "hawks," or the ones more inclined to keep raising rates, while "doves" favor a longer pause.
That's setting the stage for what Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy Americas, calls a "hawkish skip" for the Fed this afternoon.
She said that while easing inflation data "reduces the risk that the Fed may have to keep hiking into the 6% range, the data is not enough to conclude that the Fed will ease anytime soon." The federal funds rate is currently in a range of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent, up from virtually zero early last year.
That could also be setting the stage for at least one dissent in the vote by the Fed's policy making committee this afternoon. If that were to happen, it would be the first since last June, noted Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79 per cent from 3.82 per cent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.62 per cent from 4.67 per cent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher in Europe and mixed across Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.5 per cent, continuing a strong run where it's already jumped more than 28 per cent this year.

After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007.
It's decision day for the Federal Reserve, and markets are positioned for policymakers to put their interest-rate hiking campaign on ice, for now.
Near 10 a.m. ET, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up slightly, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost around 0.4%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).
Most of the day's market action is expected to come after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begins his press conference later.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are drifting in early trading on Wall Street as investors wait to hear what the Federal Reserve’s latest decision will be on interest rates. The S&P 500 was little changed early Wednesday after riding a winning streak to its best level since April 2022. The Dow fell 137 points, or 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%. Markets were mostly quiet, with the main event coming later in the afternoon when the Fed will announce its latest move on interest rates. The Fed has jacked up rates to their highest levels since 2007 in hopes of getting inflation under control.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Wall Street futures are mixed Wednesday ahead of an interest rate policy decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve and new inflation data.
Futures for the Dow fell about 0.1% before the bell and the S&P 500 ticked up 0.2%.
A cooler reading on U.S. inflation on Tuesday buoyed hopes the Federal Reserve will announce that it is skipping an interest rate hike after its meeting Wednesday.
Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index hit a 14-month high after official data Tuesday showed U.S. consumer inflation eased to 4% over a year earlier in May from the previous month’s 4.9%. It was less than half last June’s peak of 9.1% but still double the Fed’s 2% target.
Two Fed board members have said the U.S. central bank should put off a hike while it studies the impact of previous increases.
“The Fed will see this as a window of opportunity to pause,” Clifford Bennett of ACY Securities said in a report.
It is hoped that the U.S. economy can avoid a recession even after the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate to a 16-year high to cool economic activity in a bid to extinguish surging inflation.
Tuesday’s inflation reading prompted traders to increase bets for the Fed to announce no change to interest rates. That would be the first monthly meeting in more than a year without a rate hike, though the expectation is for the Fed to resume raising rates in July even if it holds steady this week.
Previous rate hikes led to a contraction in manufacturing and three high-profile bank failures. Tech and other high-growth stocks are seen as some of the biggest beneficiaries if the Fed eases off rate hikes.
Many investors came into this year predicting a recession would hit in the third quarter, which is two weeks away. Yet a resilient job market has propped up economic activity.
At midday in Europe, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.6% and the DAX in Frankfurt advanced 0.9%.
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1% to 3,228.98 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 1.5% to 33,502.42. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost less than 0.6% to 19,408.42.
The Kospi in South Korea was off 0.7% at 2,619.08 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 7,161.70.
India's Sensex added 0.2% to 63,244.17. New Zealand declined while Singapore and Bangkok advanced.
In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.05 to $70.47 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $2.30 on Tuesday to $69.42. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, added $1.18 to $75.47 per barrel in London. It gained $2.45 the previous session to $74.29.
The dollar declined to 140.02 yen from Tuesday's 140.29 yen. The euro gained to $1.0807 from $1.0790.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.7%. The Dow gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq composite rallied 0.8%.

BlackRock outlined that the Federal Reserve will keep rates elevated for longer as inflation remains above the the target goal which has been supported by tight labor markets. Learn more.
BlackRock expects the Federal Reserve to keep rates elevated for longer than many expect, as inflation remains above the Fed’s target goal due to wage pressures in tight labor markets.
"We think tight labor markets are driving wage gains and making core inflation sticky – even as the U.S. and European economies have arguably slipped into recession," the world’s largest asset manager said in a recent weekly commentary note.
The firm added: "In particular, the U.S. lacks enough workers to fill job openings, while in Europe, workers have left the private sector for the public sector. Tight labor markets could squeeze corporate profit margins or force companies to trim workforces to maintain profits."
BlackRock went on to highlight that these sorts of dynamics can potentially mean broad asset class exposure (SP500), (DJI), (COMP.IND) may not produce the same level of returns as they have compared to the past.
The asset manager also stated the U.S. economy is now in a recession built on certain income-based measures, while the euro region Q1 GDP data established it has dipped into a mild recession.
See below a snapshot of 2023’s assets range and year-to-date performance per BlackRock’s note.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve, having raised interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades, is poised Wednesday to leave rates alone for the first time in 15 months to allow time to gauge the impact of its aggressive drive to tame inflation.
Yet top Fed officials have made clear that any such pause may be brief — more of a “skip” — with another rate hike likely as soon as their next meeting in late July.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other top policymakers have also indicated that they want to assess how much a pullback in bank lending might be weakening the economy. Banks have been slowing their lending — and demand for loans has fallen — as interest rates have risen.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the collapse of three large banks last spring could cause nervous lenders to sharply tighten their loan qualifications and worsen the drop in lending. Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated, though, that such damage will be modest.
For the Fed, “skipping” a rate hike at this week’s meeting may be the most effective way for Powell to unite a fractious policymaking committee. The 18 committee members appear split between those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is for at least a few months and see whether inflation further moderates. This group is concerned that hiking too aggressively would heighten the risk of causing a deep recession.
A government report Tuesday on inflation offered some ammunition to both camps, with overall price increases sharply slowing but some measures of underlying inflation remaining high. Consumer prices as a whole rose a modest 4% in May from 12 months earlier, the smallest such rise in more than two years and way below April’s 4.9% annual increase.
Yet much of that drop reflected sharply lower gas prices and slowdown in food inflation. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, uncomfortably high inflation persisted: So-called core prices rose 5.3% year over year, down from 5.5% in April but far above the Fed’s 2% annual target.
At the same time, the gradual but steady decline in overall inflation suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have had some success. The central bank has jacked up its key rate by a substantial 5 percentage points since March 2022.
Those hikes have led to much higher costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and business borrowing. The Fed’s goal is to achieve the delicate task of slowing borrowing and spending enough to cool growth and tame inflation, without derailing the economy in the process.
Tuesday’s inflation data showed that most of the rise in core prices reflected high rents and used car prices. Those costs are expected to ease later this year.
Wholesale used car prices, for example, fell in May, raising the prospect that retail prices will follow suit. And rents are expected to ease in the coming months as new leases are signed with milder price increases. Those lower prices, though, will take time to feed into the government’s measure.
Some economists have suggested that if those measures start to fall and reduce core inflation, the Fed might end up keeping its key rate unchanged for the rest of the year. Or the policymakers might decide to raise their key rate one last time in July, to about 5.4%, and keep it there.
“We think next month’s increase is probably the last of the cycle,” said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS.
On Wednesday, Fed officials will also update their quarterly economic projections, including a forecast of what their key rate will be at year’s end. Most economists expect that rate to tick up from the current 5.1% to 5.4%. That would signal that the central bank doesn’t think it has yet curbed inflation. If inflation were to remain chronically high in the months ahead, the Fed might decide to continuing raising rates.
The economy has fared better than the central bank and most economists had expected at the beginning of the year. Companies are still hiring at a robust pace, which has helped encourage many people to keep spending, particularly on travel, dining out and entertainment.
As a result, the Fed’s updated forecasts Wednesday may reflect its expectation that economic growth will pick up, albeit modestly. Analysts say the policymakers will likely project that the economy will expand 1% this year — a sluggish figure but up from a forecast in March of an anemic 0.4%.
Fed officials will also likely forecast a lower unemployment rate than they did three months ago, perhaps to 4.1% by year’s send, compared with their forecast in March of 4.5%. (The current jobless rate is 3.7%.)
In addition, they will likely raise their inflation estimate, with year-over-year core inflation envisioned to reach 3.8% by the end of this year, up from a forecast of 3.6% in March.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesale prices in the United States dropped 0.3% from April to May, another sign that inflationary pressures continue to ease in the face of repeated interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department's producer price index — which measures inflation before it reaches consumers — rose 1.1% last month from May 2022, it said Wednesday, the smallest year-over-year gain since December 2020.
On a month-to-month basis, overall producer prices have now dropped three of the last four months. In May, wholesale inflation was pulled down by a 13.8% drop in gasoline prices.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation was up 0.2% last from April and 2.8% from a year earlier, the mildest gain since February 2021.
Unleashed by an unexpectedly strong economic recovery from 2020's COVID-19 recession, inflation began to rise in 2021 and last year reached levels not seen since the early 1980s. In response, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 10 times in the past 15 months. At their meeting Wednesday, Fed policymakers are expected to leave the rate alone to give themselves time to assess the impact the aggressive rate hikes have had on the economy.
Inflation has been receding. Year-over-year increases in producer prices peaked at 11.7% in March 2022 and have fallen 11 straight months.
On Tuesday, the Labor Department said that its consumer price index rose just 0.1% last month from April and 4% from May 2022 — the lowest 12-month figure in two years and down from a 4.9% increase in April. Inflation in consumer prices is still running ahead of the Fed's 2% year-over-year target.
The April-to-May drop in producer prices beat the 0.1% slide that economists had forecast.
“Producer prices have downshifted sharply and core PPI is steadily moving towards the 2% target,’’ said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. “Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’

After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007.
It's decision day for the Federal Reserve, and markets are positioned for policymakers to put their interest-rate hiking campaign on ice, for now.
Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are edging higher, but those on the Dow are slipping in the early going Wednesday.
Most of the day's market action is expected to come after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begins his press conference later.
Live Updates M Producer prices show inflation pressures slowing After data out Tuesday showed consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in over two years, a reading on producer prices Wednesday morning showed inflation pressures continue to ease across the business world. The Producer Price Index (PPI) report for May showed prices fell 0.3% over the prior month on a headline basis and rose just 1.1% over the prior year, the least since PPI rose just 0.8% over the prior back in December 2020. Excluding food, energy, and trade, producer prices rose 2.8% against the prior year in May, the least since February 2021. Ahead of this afternoon's expected decision from the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes, the latest PPI data only solidify any doubts some might've had about whether the central bank has a case to sit tight on interest rates this month.

NEW YORK – The Federal Reserve's likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation.
That's not to say the Fed is done raising rates. Most economists foresee another increase or two, starting as soon as next month. And even after the Fed has stopped hiking, it's likely to keep borrowing rates at a peak for months to come. Consumers would still have to bear the weight of higher-cost auto loans, mortgages, credit cards and other forms of borrowing.
Still, some people may feel encouraged by the possibility that loan rates are approaching a peak. And in the meantime, people with savings accounts are enjoying higher yields than they have in years. Fortunately, that isn't likely to change anytime soon.
HOW WILL BORROWERS BE AFFECTED BY ALL THIS?
Though the Fed may not have reached the absolute top of its rate-raising cycle, it's getting close. That said, it doesn't mean relief is on the way.
“Even once the Fed stops raising interest rates, borrowing rates are still very, very high,” said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com’s chief financial analyst. “Some of these rates are higher than many consumers have ever seen.”
McBride noted that credit card rates, in particular, are at or near their all-time peaks, mortgage rates have more than doubled in two years and auto loan rates have reached their highest level in about a dozen years. Even if rates were to hold steady, borrowing costs across the economy will remain much higher than they were in recent years. Some consumers may struggle to continue making loan payments on time as they simultaneously face inflated prices for many goods and services.
“That means debt repayment has taken on a renewed urgency,” McBride said. “If you have credit card debt, that is a top priority to get paid down.”
Matt Schulz of LendingTree suggested that consumers who have debt should “assume that rates will continue to rise and focus on paying down their balances as quickly as possible," to err on the safe side.
Card users, he said, might consider asking their issuers to offer a lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR), if possible. In a recent report, LendingTree concluded that a majority of cardholders who had asked their card issuers for a lower rate received one. The average reduction was significant — 6 percentage points.
“It is well worth your time to make that call,” Schulz said.
Right now, the average APR on a new credit card offer is a towering 23.98%, according to LendingTree.
“And they're probably going to still creep higher in the immediate future,” Schulz said, even if the Fed doesn't raise rates Wednesday.
For a typical credit card already in use, the average APR was only slightly lower — 20.92% — according to the latest data from the Fed.
I NEED TO BUY A CAR. WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR AUTO LOANS?
Loan rates for new vehicles have stayed constant for the past few months, at an average of about 7%. That isn't likely to change even with the Fed leaving rates alone for now, said Ivan Drury, senior manager at Edmunds.com. Auto loan rates, Drury said, tend to reflect buyer demand for vehicles more than they do the Fed's interest rate decisions.
Auto sales, while still way below pre-pandemic levels, remain fairly strong, automakers are selling at still-high prices and profits are solid. Unless sales were to slow, companies and dealers won’t likely reduce prices or offer subsidized loan rates.
“Everyone seems too content," Drury said.
With loan rates unlikely either to rise or fall much anytime soon, buyers who absolutely need a vehicle may increasingly come off the sidelines. Autos are generally staying on dealer lots for only 35-40 days before being sold. Until they start sitting for 60 days or more, Drury said, automakers probably won’t cut prices.
New vehicle prices averaged $47,892 in May, 1.3% below the peak in December. Yet any decline has been offset by costlier loan rates, which have surged nearly a half point over the same period.
Prices for used vehicles also dropped somewhat last year but remain comparatively high. The national average in May was $29,387, down about 5% from the May 2022 peak but nearly $9,000 more than the average before the pandemic. (As of May, the average used-vehicle loan rate was about 11%.)
“Make sure your credit is in tip-top shape, shop around for financing and have an offer in your back pocket before you go to the dealership,” said Bankrate's McBride.
WHAT'S LIKELY IN STORE FOR SAVERS?
Ken Tumin, a banking expert and founder of DepositAccounts.com, noted that while yields for savings accounts and certificates of deposit are the highest they’ve been in a decade, the pace of increases is slowing. With the Fed likely nearing the end of rate hiking, any further increases in yields may be comparatively small.
“Banks will have reason to slow their deposit rate increases,” Tumin said.
Still, it's worth noting that these accounts are much more rewarding than they were as recently as a year ago. The average online savings account yield is now 3.98% — up from 3.31% at the start of this year and from 0.73% from a year ago, according to DepositAccounts.com. The average yield on an online one-year CD is 4.86%, up from 4.37% at the start of the year and from 1.49% a year ago.
McBride suggested that consumers comparison-shop to find the best rates on high-yield savings accounts. He noted that online banks, in particular, are paying yields of 5% or better.
“Savings rates are the highest we’ve seen since the financial crisis,” he said. "Banks that need deposits — like online banks — are competing aggressively by paying higher rates.”
By contrast, McBride said, "brick-and-mortar banks, who have a surplus of deposits — their rates reflect that. They will intentionally have lower rates, and some of them have no intention of catching up.”
Overall, he noted, consumers can enjoy savings rates that haven't been this high in 15 years.
“That’s not a bad place to have money parked,” said McBride.
IS THE FED MANAGING TO DEFEAT INFLATION?
The Fed has clearly achieved progress. Inflation, which peaked above 9% last year, is less than half that level now. Yet the latest inflation readings remain well above the Fed's 2% target. Many households are still feeling heavy financial pressure as a result. Reducing inflation back to the Fed's target level will require more time.
“That might mean the Fed is going to have to hold rates higher for longer, and it may even mean boosting rates further in the months ahead,” McBride said.
The central bank has now raised rates at its fastest pace in 40 years.
“That doesn't mean the Fed is going to start cutting rates or that other rate hikes this year are completely out of the question,” said Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree. “It just means they may be willing to hold rates where they are and let the economy continue to settle without more rate-related prodding in the immediate future.”
If the economy does cool, Channel predicts that mortgage rates may end the year closer to 6% than to 7%. (The current national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.71%, according to Freddie Mac.)
“There's a very significant cumulative impact (of rate hikes), but it doesn't hit all right away,” McBride said. For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, "gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”

With unemployment still low and inflation still high, the Federal Reserve is likely to signal Wednesday that, if necessary, it will increase interest rates in the future in order to cool the economy.
With unemployment still low and inflation still high, the Federal Reserve is likely to signal Wednesday that, if necessary, it will increase interest rates in the future in order to cool the economy.
But, at least for this month, experts believe the central bank is likely to say it will take a wait-and-see approach to assess the impact of its aggressive rate-hiking program.
That means a pause could be on the horizon.
Since March last year through May this year, the Federal Open Market Committee has raised interest rates 10 consecutive times. As of Tuesday, the central bank's key federal funds rate stood at approximately 5%.
As the federal funds rate has climbed, so have other lending rates across the economy, from credit cards to corporate lending, which touched their highest levels in decades.
By making it more expensive to borrow and invest, the Fed has been working to slow the overall demand in the economy and thus reduce upward price pressure.
Inflation is indeed coming down — from a peak annual rate of more than 9% last June to 4% in May.
But that is still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
So even as the central bank looks to take a break from its interest rate hikes, it plans to tell businesses and consumers there are more increases to come.
Why interest rates may stay elevated for now
"The case to keep hiking remains strong," Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macroeconomics, a data and consultancy group, wrote in a note to clients Monday.
He noted that unemployment, at 3.7%, remains much lower than what the Fed has anticipated. Meanwhile, economic growth actually appears to be picking up, he said, citing a recent forecast from the International Monetary Fund.
What's more, bank lending, home prices and stock prices have all begun to increase again, he said.
At least one Fed official agrees there is no need to stop the interest rate bumps now.
“I don’t really see a compelling reason to pause — meaning wait until you get more evidence to decide what to do,” Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said last month in an interview with the Financial Times. “I would see more of a compelling case for bringing (rates) up.”
Making the case for a pause
Others disagree that the Fed needs to stay on its current pace of hiking, citing the fact that it often takes time for tighter monetary policy to take full effect in the economy.
"We have seen inflation continue to improve — the trend is lower," Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview.
In addition to an apparent slowdown in price increases, the labor market is also showing signs of weakness, he said, citing higher jobless claims, reduced hours worked and lower demand for temporary payrolls.
Another Fed official stands squarely in the wait-and-see corner.
“Maybe the majority of the tightening impact of what the Fed already did is still to come,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last month.
“And then you add the bank stresses on top of it," he said, referring to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank in March and May, respectively.
"We have got to take that into account,” Goolsbee added.
What's more, the Fed can always tighten monetary policy later, Kourkafas said. But it may not need to.
"Something has to give, and growth is going to give later," he said.
While there is indeed a "foundation" for an emerging bull market, it is likely premature to say that the nation is at the start of a new economic cycle, he said.
"I think there is going to be some cost to tightening, in the form of slower growth down the road," Kourkafas said.
"It's not going to be a deep or prolonged downturn, but at the same time, as pandemic effects fade, like cumulative savings and pent up demand, it suggests lower customer spending, and slower economic growth," he said.


Global shares edged higher and the dollar held near three-week lows on Wednesday as traders were all but certain that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking interest rates later in the session. The much-watched U.S. CPI report on Tuesday showed prices barely rose in May, with just a 0.1% increase from the prior month.
Global shares edged higher and the dollar held near three-week lows on Wednesday as traders were all but certain that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking interest rates later in the session.
The much-watched U.S. CPI report on Tuesday showed prices barely rose in May, with just a 0.1% increase from the prior month. On an annual basis, consumer prices rose 4%, the smallest in more than two years, slowing from April's 4.9%. That has crystallised traders' views that the Fed is unlikely to hike rates later on Wednesday. They now see more than a 90% chance of the bank staying put.
Expecting a pause global stock markets were in an upbeat mood. Europe's pan-regional Stoxx 600 index was up 0.7% by 1128 GMT. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.2%, setting Wall Street for further gains after U.S. stocks rallied to 14-month highs overnight. "Having already flagged the possibility of a pause I think it's unlikely that (the Fed) would veer off course at this particular juncture," said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank in London.
"They do clearly appear to be approaching this on a somewhat cautious basis given the elevated level of uncertainty. The CPI data yesterday was pretty much bang in line so nothing there to challenge this outlook." The U.S. dollar dropped 0.2% against major peers, hovering near a three-week low it hit on Tuesday. That supported the euro, which was up 0.1% to $1.0850, hovering just below Tuesday's three-week high of $1.08235.
Market pricing suggests a pause is all but certain, but traders are also bracing for the possibility of a hawkish surprise, with a 60% probability of a 25 basis-point hike priced in by July. While U.S. inflation dropped more than expected in May, core inflation which strips out volatile prices remains elevated in a headache for the Fed.
"That persistence means that investors still think that today will only mark a skip on rate hikes rather than a pause," said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. After hitting the highest since March on Tuesday, two-year Treasury yields were down 2 bps to 4.67%, after reversing some of the drop they posted in earlier London trade.
The benchmark 10-year yield was down similarly after hitting the highest in 2-1/2 weeks on Tuesday. In the UK, where data showing a rapid pickup in UK wage growth on Tuesday has prompted traders to raise their bets on Bank of England rate hikes, sterling touched a fresh one-month high of $1.26500.
UK government bonds calmed on Wednesday and two-year yields were 5 basis points lower on the day, following Tuesday's sell-off that sent them 25 basis points higher, above levels seen during September's "mini budget" crisis. German two-year bond yields touched a fresh high since March ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank rates decision.
Oil prices rose more than $1 on the day with Brent crude futures up 1.4% to $75.33 per barrel, supported by bullish demand forecasts from the International Energy Agency.
Stocks also had an upbeat session in parts of Asia. Tokyo's Nikkei continued to outperform, closing at a fresh 33-year high, ahead of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Friday where it is expected to maintain its ultra-loose policy. Chinese blue chips marked the fifth straight session of gains on hopes for more economic stimulus, which could come on Thursday when China's central bank is expected to cut rates on medium-term policy loans, following a short-term lending rate cut on Tuesday.
But Chinese stimulus is denting the yuan, which fell to a 6-1/2 month low following Tuesday's rate cut and anticipation of more. Gold prices were last up 0.15% at $1,946.39 per ounce

New York CNN —
Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to announce on Wednesday a pause in their regimen of rate hikes.
After 10 consecutive hikes, investors are pricing in a 94% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged for the first time since January 2022, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool.
But a pause is not a full stop.
The labor market, which policymakers believe to be a key driver of inflation in the dominant services sector of the economy, is still remarkably strong. Now there’s a growing consensus on Wall Street that central bank officials could restart the hikes, meant to fight elevated inflation, as soon as July.
But what does the Fed mean when it talks about labor markets and their impact on inflation? A lot of it has to do with a troublesome slowdown in productivity.
What’s happening: At its most basic level, labor productivity is a measure of the value of the goods and services produced by a company compared with the amount of labor used to produce that output.
Productivity moves in the opposite direction to wages and so if it remains depressed, there will be upward pressure on labor costs — and ultimately on inflation, said Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
That’s a big deal to Fed officials who have spoken publicly about their fears of a wage-price spiral — the feedback loop that drives inflation higher as people make more money and go out and spend it.
“The crosscurrents for the Fed are complex. Big bets about the pace of the hiking path are ill advised,” said Shalett.
During the Fed policy meeting in May, participants expressed worry that even though the pace of wage growth has been gradually slowing, it’s still “running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over the longer run with the Committee’s 2% inflation objective,” according to minutes from the meeting.
Productivity in the United States has been steadily declining since 2005, but the post-pandemic landscape has accelerated that downturn significantly. Labor productivity decreased 2.1% in the first quarter of 2023, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this month.
That was the worst reading since 2007, according to the BLS.
Bad for the economy: A lack of qualified labor is one of the biggest challenges for companies today, according to a new McKinsey Global Institute report. Returning to the 2.2% average annual growth in productivity seen between 1948 and 2019 (compared to 1.4% between 2005 and 2019) would add $10 trillion to US GDP — or about $15,000 per household by 2030, the report found.
In comments late last year, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook told a crowd in Michigan that “innovation and productivity growth undergird our long-term growth prospects.”
Over the long run, labor productivity “means everything” to the economy, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM US.
The silver lining: The good news is technological innovations typically drive upturns in productivity and AI could be such an innovation. Still, those benefits could take some time to materialize, warned Bank of America analysts on Tuesday.
CEOs, leaders have mixed feelings about AI
Artificial intelligence has been billed as the technology that will revolutionize the world as we know it. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has even called it “more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we’ve done in the past.”
But some executives aren’t convinced.
At an online meeting Monday of more than 250 leaders convened by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, head of the Yale School of Management’s CEO Leadership Institute, there was little agreement about how to handle AI.
About 42% of leaders on the call said that AI could have catastrophic implications while 58% said no, according to Chief Executive, an independent CEO news and data group that attended the debate. About 87% of the CEOs at the event said they disagreed that AI’s potential was “overstated,” but there were still some key divergences, the group reported.
Connecticut Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal, who was on the call, said that there needed to be “a kind of nutrition label so that people can distinguish between the faith and the true, and so that there is greater identification, watermark, if you will, on some of these products,” according to Chief Executive. “There’s a lot of government support for some kind of government regulation,” he said.
Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon, said that “it’s a really exciting time” for AI and that “it feels like frequently that we’re only limited by our imaginations as it relates to what we can do.”
Technology investor Roger McNamee added that he fears the cost of maintaining large AI systems are going to explode in the current high interest rate environment, and that those costs could soon be passed down to customers.
Director Steven Spielberg, who was being honored on the call, had the last word. AI is okay, so long as it doesn’t interfere with his work, he said: “As Vito Corleone said in the first Godfather movie, ‘as long as your business doesn’t interfere with mine.’”
Yellen on US-China trade: ‘Decoupling would be a big mistake’
Janet Yellen said Tuesday that it’s best if the United States retains ties with China, even as tensions between the two nations grow.
“While we surely have concerns that need to be addressed, decoupling would be a big mistake,” Yellen said in her testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. Americans “benefit greatly” from buying goods that are cheaper to produce in China, she added. China equally benefits from US exports that also bolster the US economy.
That’s why, she stressed, it would be “disastrous” to cease trading with China, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. “De-risk? Yes. Decouple? Absolutely not,” Yellen said, echoing the joint statement leaders from the Group of Seven made at last month’s summit in Japan.
Yellen also called on lawmakers to lend more money to developing countries to counter China’s growing influence.
In addition to increasing lending to International Monetary Fund programs, Yellen told lawmakers that the Biden administration wants to boost involvement in the Inter-American Development Bank group’s private-sector investment fund and the African Development Fund.
“These investments will bolster our engagement in these regions at a time of geopolitical competition,” Yellen said. Lending to organizations like the IMF “serves as an important counterweight to nontransparent, unsustainable lending from others like China.”


U.S. producer prices fell more than expected in May and the annual increase in producer inflation was the smallest in nearly 2-1/2 years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to skip raising interest rates on Wednesday.
WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell more than expected in May and the annual increase in producer inflation was the smallest in nearly 2-1/2 years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to skip raising interest rates on Wednesday.
The producer price index for final demand dropped 0.3% last month on lower energy costs after rising by an unrevised 0.2% in April, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.
In the 12 months through May, the PPI climbed 1.1%. That was the smallest year-on-year rise since December 2020 and followed a 2.3% increase in April. The annual PPI rate is moderating as last year's surge drops out of the calculation.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% from the prior month and rising 1.5% on year.
The report followed data on Tuesday showing consumer prices edging up in May. The year-on-year increase in the consumer price index was the smallest since March 2021.
Fed officials are expected to keep rates unchanged at the end of their two-day meeting, for the first time since March 2022 when the U.S. central bank embarked on its fastest monetary policy tightening campaign in more than 40 years.
The Fed, which has hiked its policy rate by 500 basis points in this tightening cycle, was seen leaving the door open to further rate increases given the economy's resilience, particularly the labor market.

Federal Reserve policy-makers at the end of their two-day meeting may well signal more rate increases are still to come once they take time to assess how the economy is evolving

The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. central bank kicked off a historically aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in March of 2022.
But don’t call it a pivot or a pause.
Policy-makers at the end of their two-day meeting may well signal more rate increases are still to come once they take time to assess how the economy is evolving, whether the financial system remains stable, and if inflation is continuing to fall.
“We probably need a little more tightening, but it is not clear how much,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist in the fixed income division at T. Rowe Price Associates, noting that despite strength in recent employment and core inflation reports, a “nuanced” reading of the data showed both may be set to weaken.
“When there is this much uncertainty it makes sense to proceed cautiously,” she said.
The Fed is scheduled to release its policy statement and new quarterly economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference half an hour later.
A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023.
Data since the last Fed meeting in early May has left policy-makers with a tough set of signals to read, and ample room for debate.
The economy continues to generate strong monthly job and wage gains, and one of the U.S. central bank’s more closely watched measures – the ratio of open jobs to the number of unemployed – rose recently in a sign the labour market remains misaligned between the demand for workers and those available.
Inflation is declining only slowly, with some aspects of it proving more persistent than anticipated. The closely watched Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy has not improved much this year, and as of April was increasing at a 4.7 per cent annual rate, more than double the Fed’s 2 per cent target.
Yet some forward-looking price measures show inflation may be set to fall sharply in coming months; the unemployment rate jumped significantly, from 3.4 per cent to 3.7 per cent, in May; and the year-to-year growth rate in bank lending is plummeting towards zero, part of a credit slowdown the Fed is watching carefully for signs of financial industry stress.
The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent.
The decision won’t mean rate hikes are in for an extended pause, or – a point Powell is likely to emphasize – that rate cuts are anticipated anytime soon.
The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same. A true “pivot” towards looser policy was only seen occurring in 2025, when the policy rate was projected by year’s end to decline more than inflation.


Brent crude futures were up 76 cents at $75.05 a barrel by 0916 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 63 cents at $70.05
Oil prices rose on Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s June meeting after bullish oil demand growth forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC.
Brent crude futures were up 76 cents, or 1 per cent, at $75.05 a barrel by 0916 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 63 cents, or 0.9 per cent, at $70.05.
Both benchmarks climbed more than 3 per cent the previous day on hopes of rising fuel demand after China’s central bank lowered a short-term lending rate.
Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022.
Higher interest rates strengthen the dollar, making commodities denominated in the U.S. currency more expensive for holders of other currencies. A pause in the Fed’s rate increases would spur economic growth and oil demand, supporting prices.
“Rates will most likely remain unchanged today when the Fed contemplates its next move, but the more salient question is whether this pause also means that the peak rate of the current cycle has been reached or not,” said PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga.
The IEA, meanwhile, increased its oil demand growth forecast for this year by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 2.4 million bpd, lifting the projected total to 102.3 million bpd.
However, the agency expects economic headwinds to reduce growth to 860,000 bpd next year and increasing use of electric vehicles to help to reduce that to 400,000 bpd in 2028 for overall demand of 105.7 million bpd.
The IEA’s 2023 oil demand growth figure is slightly above that of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
On the supply side, U.S. crude oil stocks rose by about 1 million barrels in the week ended June 9, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures, contrary to an average estimate of a 500,000 barrel decline from analysts polled by Reuters.
Government data on stockpiles is due later in the day.


The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to take a break and let the U.S. economy catch its breath.

On the heels of a 10-meeting streak of raising interest rates, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to take a break and let the U.S. economy catch its breath. Markets are pricing in a high probability that central bank policymakers will "skip" — an expression they generally prefer to "pause" — at this month's meeting as they digest the impact of 5 percentage points worth of increases going back to March 2022. related investing news Easing inflation pressures give the Fed room to skip a rate hike. But then what? That doesn't mean this will be the end of the hikes. It just means that with the pace of inflation waning, officials could feel this is a good time to evaluate. "They've kind of set things up for a pause," said Bill English, a former Fed official and now a finance professor at the Yale School of Management. "So they'll probably pause, but I think they'll very much want to avoid an outcome in markets where investors say, 'Hurrah! The tightening cycle is over.'" Indeed, there will be a lot of moving parts in Wednesday's Fed action. Here's a look at what to expect.
Rates
If the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee does choose to pause, that will leave the benchmark borrowing rate in a target range between 5% and 5.25%. In the market's eyes, Tuesday's consumer price index report, which showed the 12-month inflation rate falling to a two-year-low of 4%, cemented that decision.
watch now
However, the post-meeting statement could be massaged in a way that markets don't assume that policymakers have gone quiescent on inflation and are set on halting the rate-hiking cycle. "This could be a one-sided communication that they're leaning in the direction of raising rates, but they're not ready to commit just yet. They want some more information on how things are going," English said. "A hawkish pause, if you like, is something that could get pretty broad support."
The 'dots' and the economic outlook
If a hawkish pause indeed becomes the order of the day, that will send investors looking to the "dot plot," a chart of individual members' expectations of where rates are headed from here. The general chatter — reflected in market pricing — is that the dots will "move up" and indicate an additional rate hike this year, likely at the July 25-26 meeting. The last time the dots were updated, at the March gathering, there was a wide disparity among where members stood, with seven of 18 FOMC members expecting rates to go higher than the current range. Along with the dots, members will update the Summary of Economic Projections, which lists the outlook for gross domestic product, the unemployment rate and inflation as gauged by the personal consumption expenditures price index. Market expectations are that the growth outlook likely will improve, even though the Fed's own economists said in March and June that they expect a credit contraction to trigger a shallow recession later this year. Communication from the Fed, then, likely will be, "We're not convinced that this is the end of the rate hikes, but we want to take a look around see what kind of damage the banking crisis has inflicted on the economy," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It also recognizes that there's a lag between what we do and when it shows up in the economy and inflation. So we're just going to pause here."
The Powell presser


Top Fed officials have made clear that any such pause may be brief — more of a “skip” — with another rate hike likely as soon as their next meeting in late July.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve, having raised interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades, is poised Wednesday to leave rates alone for the first time in 15 months to allow time to gauge the impact of its aggressive drive to tame inflation.
Yet top Fed officials have made clear that any such pause may be brief — more of a “skip” — with another rate hike likely as soon as their next meeting in late July.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other top policymakers have also indicated that they want to assess how much a pullback in bank lending might be weakening the economy. Banks have been slowing their lending — and demand for loans has fallen — as interest rates have risen.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the collapse of three large banks last spring could cause nervous lenders to sharply tighten their loan qualifications and worsen the drop in lending. Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated, though, that such damage will be modest.
For the Fed, “skipping” a rate hike at this week’s meeting may be the most effective way for Powell to unite a fractious policymaking committee. The 18 committee members appear split between those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is for at least a few months and see whether inflation further moderates. This group is concerned that hiking too aggressively would heighten the risk of causing a deep recession.
Some measures of underlying price pressures remain high. (CNN, POOL)
A government report Tuesday on inflation offered some ammunition to both camps, with overall price increases sharply slowing but some measures of underlying inflation remaining high. Consumer prices as a whole rose a modest 4% in May from 12 months earlier, the smallest such rise in more than two years and way below April’s 4.9% annual increase.
Yet much of that drop reflected sharply lower gas prices and slowdown in food inflation. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, uncomfortably high inflation persisted: So-called core prices rose 5.3% year over year, down from 5.5% in April but far above the Fed’s 2% annual target.
At the same time, the gradual but steady decline in overall inflation suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have had some success. The central bank has jacked up its key rate by a substantial 5 percentage points since March 2022.
Those hikes have led to much higher costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and business borrowing. The Fed’s goal is to achieve the delicate task of slowing borrowing and spending enough to cool growth and tame inflation, without derailing the economy in the process.
Tuesday’s inflation data showed that most of the rise in core prices reflected high rents and used car prices. Those costs are expected to ease later this year.
Wholesale used car prices, for example, fell in May, raising the prospect that retail prices will follow suit. And rents are expected to ease in the coming months as new leases are signed with milder price increases. Those lower prices, though, will take time to feed into the government’s measure.
Some economists have suggested that if those measures start to fall and reduce core inflation, the Fed might end up keeping its key rate unchanged for the rest of the year. Or the policymakers might decide to raise their key rate one last time in July, to about 5.4%, and keep it there.
“We think next month’s increase is probably the last of the cycle,” said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS.
On Wednesday, Fed officials will also update their quarterly economic projections, including a forecast of what their key rate will be at year’s end. Most economists expect that rate to tick up from the current 5.1% to 5.4%. That would signal that the central bank doesn’t think it has yet curbed inflation. If inflation were to remain chronically high in the months ahead, the Fed might decide to continuing raising rates.
The economy has fared better than the central bank and most economists had expected at the beginning of the year. Companies are still hiring at a robust pace, which has helped encourage many people to keep spending, particularly on travel, dining out and entertainment.
As a result, the Fed’s updated forecasts Wednesday may reflect its expectation that economic growth will pick up, albeit modestly. Analysts say the policymakers will likely project that the economy will expand 1% this year — a sluggish figure but up from a forecast in March of an anemic 0.4%.
Fed officials will also likely forecast a lower unemployment rate than they did three months ago, perhaps to 4.1% by year’s end, compared with their forecast in March of 4.5%. (The current jobless rate is 3.7%.)
In addition, they will likely raise their inflation estimate, with year-over-year core inflation envisioned to reach 3.8% by the end of this year, up from a forecast of 3.6% in March.

After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007.
It's decision day for the Federal Reserve, and markets are positioned for policymakers to put their interest-rate hiking campaign on ice, for now.
Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are edging higher, but those on the Dow are slipping in the early going Wednesday.
Most of the day's market action is expected to come after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begins his press conference later.

Washington, DC CNN —
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would pause its historic rate-hiking campaign as it waits for the effects to trickle further through the economy, but signaled that additional rate hikes are likely this year.
The vote to skip a rate increase this meeting was unanimous.
Since March 2022, Fed officials have raised the central bank’s benchmark interest rate 10 times in a row in an attempt to cool the US economy and battle inflation that is still double the Fed’s target.
The Fed’s post-meeting statement confirmed that officials deem the pause a prudent move, but most officials think additional hikes are necessary this year, according to the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections.
“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference.
More rate hikes on the way
Most officials estimate the federal funds rate will top out at a range of 5.63-5.87% in 2023, suggesting there might be as many as two more quarter-point hikes this year. Rate increases larger than a quarter point are not likely since the Fed is inching closer to its inflation goal and officials thought it made “obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination,” Powell said.
Future policy moves depend on what economic indicators show in the coming weeks and months, including the resilient job market. Payroll growth remains solid, as do wage gains, which put some upward pressure on prices. Top economists argue the still-tight labor market will prove to be a stubborn source of inflation that would need to rebalance in order to help inflation successfully fall to the central bank’s 2% target. Most officials in the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, expect the unemployment rate to rise to a range of 4-4.1% this year.
“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note. “The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure.
“You are seeing there that new rents, new leases are coming in at low levels and it’s really a matter of time for that to go through the pipeline,” he said. “I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
Tighter access to credit
Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector. Banks have been toughening their lending standards this year, and that is expected to continue. That would take some steam out of spending if US consumers have a harder time accessing credit to fund their lifestyles, especially since they have racked up debt in recent months. Americans will soon cut back on goods purchases as the shift toward services spending continues, economists say.
“The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity and inflation,” Powell said. “The extent of these effects remains uncertain.”
Officials expect the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index to hover slightly above the central bank’s 2% target in 2024, but not fully reach 2% until 2025.
Economists say the July meeting will be a close call and Powell said in his presser that officials will examine “a three-month period of data” for that decision.
“We’ll also look at the evolving risk picture of what’s happening in the financial sector, we’ll look at all the data and the evolving outlook, and we’ll make a decision,” he said.
