1,"(The Hill) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted interest rates by three-fourths of a percentage point, the latest in a series of aggressive steps to tame stubborn inflation."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — the panel of Fed officials responsible for monetary policy— hiked its baseline interest rate by 0.75 percentage points Wednesday to a span of 3 to 3.25 percent.
3,It is the fifth Fed rate hike since March and the third consecutive FOMC meeting ending with a 75 basis point hike.
4,The Fed had long been expected to issue another 75 basis point hike in September as inflation continued to rise through much of the summer and linger near four-decade highs.
5,"While monthly price growth has slowed slightly, the annual inflation rate of 8.2 percent in August, according to the consumer price index, was close to levels not seen since the late 1970s."
6,Fed officials had faced some pressure to hike by a full percentage point in the weeks leading up to the Wednesday meeting after consumer prices rose again in August.
7,"Financial markets locked in a roughly 20 percent change of a 1 percentage point rate hike in the hours before the FOMC meeting concluded Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which tracks where traders expect the Fed to set interest rates."
8,"Even so, the Fed stuck to its plan for a 0.75 percentage point hike, a move bank officials portrayed as an urgent but measured attempt to smother inflation."
9,"“Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,” the FOMC said in a statement."
10,The Fed has hiked interest rates rapidly from near-zero levels set in 2020 as the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy.
11,The bank is racing to bring inflation down before it spirals out of control by slowing the economy enough to reduce the amount of spending on goods and services.
12,"Fed officials and many economists were hopeful that the bank could slow the economy and make a dent on inflation without derailing strong job growth, low unemployment and steady economic growth."
13,But experts say the chances of recession in 2024 are rising.
14,"“The Fed is in a really, really tough position, in part because they have a very limited toolkit,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director at Groundwork Collaborative."
15,"“They have inflation that’s coming from a constellation of sources,” Owens explained."
16,"The Fed’s rate hikes have slowed the housing market, curbed some hiring and weighed on economic growth."
17,"The combination of the Fed’s actions, normalizing supply chains and falling gas prices should eventually lead to lower inflation."
18,"But inflation has fallen little since the Fed’s rate hikes began and officials have pledged to keep ramping up rates until they see clear signs of slowing price growth — a process Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged would bring “pain.”
 “We’re seeing the expected consequences of this,” Owens said."
19,"“It’s working, but it is not truly taming the price increases we’re seeing.”
 Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m."
20,The peso settled at a new all-time low of 58 against the US dollar Wednesday as investors closely watch the expected new interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
21,The peso settled at a new all-time low of 58 against the US dollar Wednesday as investors closely watch the expected new interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
22,"The peso shed P0.52 to close at 58 against the greenback Wednesday, down from 57.48 Tuesday."
23,"Total trade volume reached $1.051 billion, up from $967 million a day earlier."
24,"Reports overseas said the Federal Open Market Committee headed by Jerome Powell might announce a 75-basis-point interest rate hike, with many economists not ruling out a 100-bps increase."
25,"The Fed earlier increased interest rates by 75 bps, saying it was committed to rein in inflation at 2 percent."
26,"Michael Ricafort, chief economist of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said the 58 intraday level of the peso was also the new intraday record low."
27,"ADVERTISEMENT
 “This could lead to higher import prices and overall inflation, as well as could lead to more aggressive local policy rate hike especially on Sept. 22, 2022 to help stabilize the peso, inflation and inflation expectations,” Ricafort said."
28,"“This is the 8th record-high closing rate for the US dollar/peso exchange rate since the start of 2022,” he said."
29,"Ricafort said the peso also weakened after global crude oil prices corrected slightly higher, but still near eight-month lows."
30,He said the peso already depreciated by a total of P7.001 or 13.7 percent from 50.999 in end-2021.
31,"“For tomorrow, the peso exchange rate could range [at] 57.85 to 58.05 levels,” Ricafort said."
32,"Robert Dan Roces, chief economist of Security Bank, said the continued peso weakness was due to “US dollar strength and positioning still ahead of the Fed and BSP meetings.” The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas would hold its policy meeting Thursday."
33,Roces said the BSP “should opt for a stronger message by way of clearer forward guidance beyond the actions tomorrow.
34,"Inflation is an upside risk with weaker peso.”
 Moody’s Investor Service, a unit of debt watcher Moody’s Corp., said the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas might announce a 50-bps rate hike Thursday that would bring the overnight borrowing rate to 4.25 percent."
35,Ricafort earlier said the peso also weakened after the World Bank warned that the global economy might face a recession in 2022 on aggressive monetary policy tightening or interest rate hikes that could still be not enough to bring down elevated inflation.
36,"He said the World Bank noted the “most synchronized rolling back of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures by central banks around the world in about 50 years.”
 “The peso also weakened amid some POGO [Philippine offshore gaming operations]-related policy uncertainties, especially those allegedly involved in illegal activities may have also added to some market concerns as this could reduce POGO revenues and also reduce other business activities in the country,” Ricafort said."

41,"By Alessandro Albano
 Investing.com – The Federal Reserve Operating Commission will announce its latest monetary policy decision tonight at 20:00 CEST, with market expectations set for a 75bp interest rate hike, which would lead to the new interest rate range from 2.25% -2.50% to the new 3% -3.25%."
42,"According to the futures on fed funds measured by Investing.com’s fed rate monitor, the probability of a maximum increase of a full percentage point stands at 15%, while +75bps are expected to be 85%
 With the ‘jumbo’ rise practically discounted, investors will also pay attention to the likely very hawkish tones in the press release and Governor Powell’s next press conference, and will also keep an eye on the new economic projections and dotplot chart."
43,"“We believe that the decision to raise the cost of money by 75 basis points is consistent with the macroeconomic data published”, writes Filippo Diodovich, Senior Market Strategist of IG Italia, in a note, as consumer inflation expectations “have decreased significantly."
44,“despite an increase beyond expectations in August (+ 8.3% y / y).
45,"According to the strategist, “there is therefore no reason to overreact, taking into account that the effects on the real economy of central bank decisions can be seen after many quarters, but on the financial markets the impact is immediate and a disproportionate choice."
46,compared to the trend of macro data could lead to a certain financial instability “.
47,"However, the decision to raise by 75 basis points does not diminish the Fed’s commitment to tackle inflationary pressures."
48,"IG believes, in fact, that the tones used by Powell at the press conference “will be very hawkish”, while in the economic projections the Fed economists “will revise down the estimates on real growth and will instead make an upward revision on the outlook for inflation”."
49,"As regards the expectations on policymakers ‘rates, the so-called dotplots, according to Diodovich, bankers’ expectations at the end of the year “will have totally changed”."
50,“In June the median of central bankers expected a level of the cost of money at the end of 2022 in the range 3.25% -3.50%.
51,"We believe that the median will rise in the range 4% -4.25% which would imply an increase of another 100 basis points between the November and December meetings “, says the expert."
52,"Impact on the market
 According to IG, in the very short term equity markets could “also react positively for having avoided the danger of a monstrous 100 basis point hike”."
53,"However, the manager maintains the outlook “bearish on indices and bullish on the dollar in the medium / short term in the belief that the Fed will continue to engage in aggressively tackling inflation with rates above 4% at the end of the year”."

111,What’s the logic?
112,The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates as it races to tamp down rapid inflation.
113,These moves have a lot of people wondering why rate increases — which raise the cost of borrowing money — are America’s main tool for cooling down prices.
114,Inflation right now is being driven by an economic mismatch.
115,"Consumer demand for goods and services has been chugging along, supply has not kept up as transportation snarls and factory shutdowns combine with labor shortages to slow production, and the clash has allowed companies to charge more for the products they sell."
116,"The Fed’s tools are blunt, and they can work on only one side of that equation: Demand."
117,Central bankers cannot fix roiled supply chains.
118,"But their higher interest rates can slow down the economy enough that businesses and households feel the pinch, which should in theory translate into slower wage growth, less spending and lower prices."

135,This will mark the fifth time the Fed has raised the federal funds rate.
136,"This story is part of Recession Help Desk, CNET's coverage of how to make smart money moves in an uncertain economy."
137,"What's happening In an effort to quell stubborn inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates today."
138,"Why it matters If the Fed continues to drive up interest rates, there will be consequences -- most likely an uptick in unemployment, and an increase in interest rates for mortgages, credit cards and loans."
139,"What it means for you Soaring consumer prices, tumbling stocks, increased costs to borrow money and the threat of layoffs could prove particularly devastating for low- and middle-income Americans."
140,Hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease up on rate hikes this month were extinguished with August inflation data.
141,"Today, the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fifth time this year, in an effort to curtail runaway inflation."
142,"Despite slightly cooling year over year, inflation rose by 0.1% from July to August, with food and shelter prices continuing to climb."
143,"But thanks to decreasing energy prices, including gas, inflation dipped 8.3% year over year, down from June's record high 9.1% reading, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report."
144,"The Fed is expected to raise rates by another 75 basis points, according to a Reuters poll of economists, after it wraps up its two-day meeting tomorrow."
145,"""We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return inflation to our 2% longer run goal,"" Powell said during July's press conference."
146,"""This process is likely to involve a period of below-trend economic growth, and some softening in labor market conditions."
147,"But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run."""
148,Raising interest rates is the main action the Fed can take to try to counter high inflation.
149,"When it costs more to borrow -- as with credit cards, mortgages and other loans -- consumers have less spending power and will buy fewer items, decreasing the ""demand"" side of the supply-demand equation, theoretically helping to lower prices."
150,"Many worry that further increases to the cost of borrowing money could contract the economy too much, sending us into a recession: a shrinking, rather than growing, economy."
151,The Fed acknowledges the adverse effects of this restrictive monetary policy.
152,Here's everything you need to know about what's causing this record high inflation and how the Fed hopes to bring levels back down.
153,What's happening with inflation?
154,"In August, inflation increased to 8.3% over the previous year, though it has declined slightly from July's 8.5% reading and June's record high 9.1% yearly increase, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
155,Gas prices declined significantly by 10.6% in August -- marking a two-month trend -- but that was offset by increasing prices of food and shelter.
156,"During periods of high inflation, your dollar has less purchasing power, making everything you buy more expensive, even though you're likely not getting paid more."
157,"In fact, more Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and wages aren't keeping up with inflation rates."
158,Why is inflation so high right now?
159,"In short, a lot of this can be attributed to the pandemic."
160,"In March 2020, the onset of COVID-19 caused the US economy to shut down."
161,"Millions of employees were laid off, many businesses had to close their doors and the global supply chain was abruptly put on pause."
162,"This caused the flow of goods produced and manufactured abroad and shipped to the US to cease for at least two weeks, and in many cases, for months, according to Pete Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research."
163,"But the reduction in supply was met with increased demand as Americans started purchasing durable goods to replace the services they used prior to the pandemic, said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute."
164,"""The pandemic put distortions on both the demand and supply side of the US economy,"" Bivens said."
165,"Though the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on the US economy are easing, labor disruptions and supply-and-demand imbalances persist, including shortages in microchips, steel, equipment and other goods, causing ongoing slowdowns in manufacturing and construction."
166,"Unanticipated shocks to the global economy have made things worse -- particularly subsequent COVID-19 variants, lockdowns in China (which restrict the availability of goods in the US) and the war in Ukraine (which is affecting gas and food prices), according to the World Bank."
167,"Powell confirmed the World Bank's findings at the Fed's June meeting, calling these external factors challenging because they are outside of the central bank's control."
168,"Some lawmakers have also accused corporations of seizing on inflation as an excuse to increase prices more than necessary, a form of price gouging."
169,Why is the Federal Reserve raising rates?
170,"With inflation hitting record highs, the Fed is under a great deal of pressure from policymakers and consumers to get the situation under control."
171,One of the Fed's primary objectives is to promote price stability and maintain inflation at a rate of 2%.
172,"By raising interest rates, the Fed aims to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive."
173,"In turn, consumers, investors and businesses pause on making investments and purchases with credit, which leads to reduced economic demand, theoretically reeling in prices and balancing the scales of supply and demand."
174,"The Fed raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March, followed by a half of a percentage point in May and three-quarters of a percentage point in mid-June."
175,"In July, the Fed raised rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point."
176,"This week, it's expected to raise rates again."
177,The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other for borrowing and lending.
178,"And there's a trickle-down effect: When it costs banks more to borrow from one another, they offset it by raising rates on their consumer loan products."
179,That's how the Fed effectively drives up interest rates in the US economy.
180,The federal funds rate now sits at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
181,"But the Fed thinks this needs to go up significantly to see progress on inflation, likely into the 3.5% to 4% range, according to Powell."
182,"The Fed's latest estimate is that, by the end of this year, the federal funds rate will sit at a range of 3.25% to 3.50%."
183,"However, hiking interest rates can only reduce inflationary pressures so much, especially when the current factors are largely on the supply side -- and are worldwide."
184,"A growing number of economists say that the situation is more complicated to get under control, and that the Fed's monetary policy alone is not enough."
185,Could rising interest rates spark a recession?
186,We can't yet determine how these policy moves will broadly affect prices and wages.
187,"But with more rate hikes projected this year, there's concern that the Fed will overreact by raising rates too aggressively, which could spark a more painful economic downturn or create a recession."
188,"The National Bureau of Economic Research, which hasn't yet officially determined if the US is in a recession, defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months."""
189,"That means a declining gross domestic product, or GDP, alongside diminishing production and retail sales, as well as shrinking incomes and lower employment."
190,"Pushing up rates too quickly might reduce consumer demand too much and unduly stifle economic growth, leading businesses to lay off workers or stop hiring."
191,"That would drive up unemployment, leading to another problem for the Fed, as it's also tasked with maintaining maximum employment."
192,"In a general sense, inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship."
193,"When more people are working, they have the means to spend, leading to an increase in demand and elevated prices."
194,"However, when inflation is low, joblessness tends to be higher."
195,"But with prices remaining sky-high, many investors are increasingly worried about a coming period of stagflation -- the toxic combination of slow economic growth with high unemployment and inflation."
196,"Here's what higher interest rates mean for you
 For the past two years, interest rates had been at historic lows, partially because the Fed slashed rates in 2020 to keep the US economy afloat in the face of lockdowns."
197,"The Fed kept interest rates near zero, a move made only once before, during the financial crisis of 2008."
198,"For the average consumer, increased interest rates means buying a car or a home will get more expensive, since you'll pay more in interest."
199,Higher rates could make it more expensive to refinance your mortgage or student loans.
200,"Moreover, the Fed hikes will drive up interest rates on credit cards, meaning that your debt on outstanding balances will go up."
201,Securities and crypto markets could also be negatively impacted by the Fed's decisions to raise rates.
202,"When interest rates go up, money is more expensive to borrow, leading to less liquidity in both the crypto and stock markets."
203,"Investor psychology can also cause markets to slide, as cautious investors may move their money out of stocks or crypto into more conservative investments, such as government bonds."
204,"On the flip side, rising interest rates could mean a slightly better return on your savings accounts."
205,Interest rates on savings deposits are directly affected by the federal funds rate.
206,"Several banks have already increased annual percentage yields, or APYs, on their savings accounts and certificates of deposit in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes."
207,We'll keep you updated on the evolving economic situation as it develops.
208,"The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 0.75%, increasing the cost of debt for credit cards, auto financing and other loans."
209,"To reduce persistently high inflation, the Federal Reserve announced a third consecutive ""jumbo"" interest hike of 0.75% Wednesday, further increasing the cost of debt for credit cards, vehicle financing and other loans."
210,"The fifth-straight increase to the federal funds rate brings it to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest it's been since 2008."
211,"Typically, rate increases come in 0.25% increments, but the Fed has been using supersized hikes to curb the rate of inflation, which is currently up 8.3% year over year — well above its benchmark target of 2%."
212,"By increasing its key interest rate, the central bank discourages spending, which can reduce inflation for the prices for goods and services."
213,"However, the downside to each rate hike is increased monthly debt costs for Americans."
214,Here are four things that will likely get more expensive.

217,"1. Credit cards
 Fed rate hikes affect your credit card's annual percentage rate (APR), which determines how much interest you pay for any outstanding debt not paid off by the end of the month."
218,"When the rate hikes began in early 2022, average APRs were close to 16% and have since climbed to just over 18%."
219,"With today's increase, the average credit card APR could reach closer to 19%, according to financial services site Bankrate.com."
220,"In that case, for a credit card balance of $5,000 with an APR of 19%, you'd pay an additional $1,197 in interest costs compared to an APR of 16%, if you only made the minimum payment each month."
221,2.
222,"Auto financing
 Federal funds rate hikes don't affect fixed-rate car loans already in place."
223,"However, they do increase interest costs for new auto loans, or those with variable-rate financing."
224,"At the start of 2022, the average interest rate on a 60-month new car loan was 3.85%."
225,"But with today's increase, the interest rate could nudge up closer to 5.5% to 5.75%, says Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride."
226,"That works out to about an extra $31 per month in auto financing payments, for a $35,000 new car."
227,3.
228,"Mortgages
 If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, rising interest rates will have no impact on your loan."
229,"However, if you get a new mortgage or have a variable-rate mortgage, your monthly payments could increase."
230,"Mortgage rates tend to rise with rate hikes, but they are more directly influenced by the bond market."
231,"Since early 2022, mortgage rates have climbed from 3% to over 6%, increasing the monthly costs on a 30-year fixed-rate $400,000 mortgage with a 20% down payment by a whopping $569."
232,"The one silver lining is that today's widely anticipated rate increase might already be baked into current mortgage rates, meaning they might not climb much further based on today's announcement."
233,"Mortgage rate forecasts for the remainder of the year are a mixed bag, with many suggesting that rates will level off."
234,4.
235,"Other variable-rate loans
 Expect increased costs for variable-rate loans like personal loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC)."
236,"In early 2022, HELOC interest rates were averaging more than 4%, but that rate has since climbed to 6.51%, per Bankrate.com."
237,"With the rate hike, the average rate could increase to something closer to 7.25%, says McBride."
238,"Home equity loans were 5.96% at the beginning of the year, and are now at about 7.01%, but they could nudge up closer to 8% with today's interest hike, says McBride."
239,"How much you'll pay vary widely based on your lender, the size of the loan and your credit score."

242,Everything from mortgages and credit cards to student and car loans will be impacted by another major rate hike.
243,Here’s what it could mean for your monthly expenses.
244,"The Federal Reserve raised the target federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row, in an effort to cool down unrelenting inflation."

 5 ways the Fed's interest rate hike may affect you
 How persistent high inflation may affect your tax bracket
 These steps can help you tackle stressful credit card debt
 What the federal funds rate means to you
 The federal funds rate, which is set by the U.S. central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight."
250,"Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and saving rates they see every day."
251,This rate hike will correspond with a rise in the prime rate and immediately send financing costs higher for many forms of consumer borrowing.
252,"""You are peddling into a progressively stiffer headwind as interest rates rise,"" McBride said."
253,"""Credit card rates are the highest since 1996, mortgage rates are the highest since 2008, and auto loans are the highest since 2012."""
254,"On the flip side, higher interest rates also mean savers will earn more money on their deposits and, already, ""high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit are at levels last seen in 2009,"" McBride noted."
255,"What borrowers should know about higher rates
 • Your credit card rate will rise."
256,"Since most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark."
257,"As the federal funds rate rises, the prime rate does, as well, and your credit card rate follows suit within one or two billing cycles."
258,That means anyone who carries a balance on their credit card will soon have to shell out even more just to cover the interest charges.
259,"Because of this rate hike, consumers with credit card debt will spend an additional $5.3 billion on interest, according to an analysis by WalletHub."
260,"Factoring in the rate hikes from from March, May, June, July and September, credit card users will wind up paying around $20.9 billion more in 2022 than they would have otherwise, WalletHub found."
261,"As rates rise, the best thing you can do is pay down high-cost debt — ""2022 has been a pretty brutal year for folks with credit card debt, and unfortunately it is likely to get worse before it gets better,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree."
262,"""A 0% balance transfer credit card may be your best weapon in the battle against credit card debt and rising interest rates,"" he advised."
263,"Otherwise, consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a lower-interest home equity loan or personal loan, Schulz said."
264,"""You won't get the 0% rate that you might find with a credit card, but a personal loan can be a good option for refinancing and consolidating loans as rates continue to climb."""
265,• Mortgage rates are already higher.
266,"Adjustable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit are also pegged to the prime rate, but 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the economy."
267,"As a result, ""today's rates are at their highest levels since the Great Recession,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree."
268,"Along with the central bank's vow to stay tough on inflation, the average interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 6%, nearly double what it was at the end of 2021."
269,"On a $300,000 loan, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at December's rate of 3.11% would have meant a monthly payment of about $1,283."
270,"Today's rate of 6.02% brings the monthly payment to $1,803."
271,"That's an extra $520 a month or $6,240 more a year, and $187,200 more over the lifetime of the loan, according to LendingTree."
272,"If you are house shopping, ""you shouldn't worry too much about whether or not rates could eventually come down,"" Channel advised."
273,"If rates do fall over the coming years, you may get an opportunity to refinance, he noted."
274,"""In other words, you shouldn't feel like you'll be locked into today's rates forever if you decide to buy a home in the near future."""
275,• Auto loans are more expensive.
276,"Even though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because the price for all cars is rising along with the interest rates on new loans, so if you are planning to buy a car, you'll shell out more in the months ahead."
277,"The Fed's latest move could push up the average interest rate on a new car loan past 6%, although consumers with higher credit scores may be able to secure better loan terms."
278,"Paying an annual percentage rate of 6% instead of 5% would cost consumers $1,348 more in interest over the course of a $40,000, 72-month car loan, according to data from Edmunds."
279,"""Auto purchases are large-ticket items where interest rates matter,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights."
280,"""They can make or break a deal, and rapidly rising interest rates could easily push many consumers past their comfort zone for monthly payments."""
281,• Student loans vary by type.
282,"Federal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers won't be impacted immediately by a rate hike."
283,"But if you are about to borrow money for college, the interest rate on federal student loans taken out for the 2022-2023 academic year already rose to 4.99%, up from 3.73% last year and 2.75% in 2020-2021."
284,"If you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark."
285,"Currently, average private student loan fixed rates can range from 3.22% to 13.95% and 1.29% to 12.99% for variable rates, according to Bankrate."
286,"As with auto loans, they also vary widely based on your credit score."
287,"Of course, anyone with existing education debt should check whether they are eligible for federal student loan forgiveness."
288,"What savers should know about higher rates
 • Savers have to shop around to benefit."
289,The good news is that the interest rates on savings accounts are finally higher after several consecutive rate hikes.
290,"While the Fed has no direct influence on deposit rates, they tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate, and the savings account rates at some of the largest retail banks, which have been near rock bottom during most of the Covid pandemic, are currently up to 0.13%, on average."
291,"Thanks, in part, to lower overhead expenses, top-yielding online savings account rates are as high as 2.5%, much higher than the average rate from a traditional, brick-and-mortar bank."
292,"As the central bank continues its rate-hiking cycle, these yields will continue to rise, as well."
293,"However, they may not increase as much as you would expect, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com."
294,"""Many banks are still flush with deposits and aren't aggressively raising deposit rates,"" Tumin said."
295,"In fact, savings account rates today are lower than they were in early 2019 when the federal funds rate was the same, he noted."
296,"Still, because the inflation rate is now higher than all of these rates, any money in savings loses purchasing power over time."
297,"""Know your dollar will not pay for as much as it did before,"" said Natalia Brown, the chief client operations officer at National Debt Relief."
298,"""If you are already having trouble keeping your head above water, it's an opportunity to reassess your finances,"" Brown said."
299,"But ""before taking any additional credit, seek help,"" she added."

302,The current rate-tightening cycle is far from over.
303,"On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting body, will again raise rates aggressively, almost certainly by 75 basis points."
304,"Equally important, in its statement accompanying the rate-setting decision on Wednesday afternoon, the FOMC will likely signal that it will hike by an additional 75 basis points at its early November meeting, just a handful of days before the midterm elections."
305,The FOMC statement accompanying the rate hiking decision will contain few changes from the statement made in July when the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points.
306,"In July, the Fed said consumption and production ""have softened"" but that employment is robust and resilient."
307,"This time, the FOMC is likely to state explicitly that ""inflation remains elevated."""
308,Critics of the Fed’s policy of continuing to raise rates aggressively note that headline inflation has peaked.
309,These critics fret that aggressive Fed action raises significantly the risk of a deep recession where unemployment would rise substantially.
310,"But the Fed’s critics, economists identified with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, are silent about the sticky components of inflation: wage inflation, up over 6% , shelter inflation, which the Dallas Fed said it sees peaking in the late spring, and services inflation, which the Dallas Fed said will continue to put upward pressure on overall inflation."
311,"The Dallas Fed explained that the tight labor market exerts upward pressure on demand for services, which tend to be labor-intensive."
312,"Finally, on the sticky components of inflation, the Dallas Fed said healthcare inflation is only now emerging."
313,It noted that the pace of wage increases for healthcare workers is rising above 2%.
314,"The Dallas Fed said wage growth among hospital workers leads to PCE hospital services inflation and PCE healthcare inflation ""by about one year."""
315,"The Dallas Fed further explained that healthcare inflation has a “disproportionate impact on PCE inflation,” the Fed’s preferred inflation metric."
316,"It should be clear that Larry Summers and Jason Furman, two economists associated with the Democratic Party, are correct : The Fed must keep raising rates aggressively."
317,Inflation is far from defeated .
318,"Summers went so far as to say that the Fed must keep raising rates until the Fed funds rate is above core inflation, which is running somewhere around 4.5-5%."
319,And he opined that Fed policy must push the unemployment rate from its current very low level of 3.7% to over 5%.
320,Such an increase would inflict pain on the economy.
321,"In order to maintain its inflation-fighting credibility, the Fed must continue to raise rates, probably by another 250 basis points: 75 basis points this afternoon, another 75 in November, and an additional 100 basis points at the post-November Fed meetings."
322,"Hard economic times are coming, especially for the rate-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and for low-skill workers in the labor-intensive services sector."
323,High inflation distorts not only consumer behavior but also business behavior .
324,Economic distortions cause productivity-sapping behavior.

 On top of everything else, the ongoing Federal Reserve campaign to tame inflation by raising interest rates is set to explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead."
585,"The Federal Reserve's widely expected move to hike interest rates on Wednesday aims to tame inflation, but it could have other side effects — including a possible recession."
586,It turns out a rate hike could also explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead.
587,A new analysis from the budget hawks at The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) predicts this week’s expected rate hike by three-quarters of a percentage point will — by itself — add $2.1 trillion to government deficits over the next decade.
588,That’s on top of a series of hikes we’ve already seen this year that have already added trillions more in costs.
589,The central bank is concluding its two-day policy meeting Wednesday with more rate hikes likely to come in the months ahead.
590,"To be sure, the deficit impact is far from the most pressing concern for policymakers focused on inflation."
591,It nonetheless is a significant factor likely to challenge the Federal Reserve and fiscal policymakers as they try to navigate a “soft landing” that brings down the inflation rate without triggering a recession.
592,"“The irresponsible fiscal policy [of recent years] has made the job of the Federal Reserve many times more difficult,"" Maya MacGuineas, the president of the CRFB, told Yahoo Finance this week."
593,"This challenge, she added, “makes the chance of a recession even more likely.”

 The national debt — the total amount of money the U.S. government owes — sits at nearly $31 trillion."
595,"Meanwhile, the U.S. has a $1 trillion annual budget deficit, which is the amount of money the U.S. must borrow each year to pay for its expenses."
596,Interest payments on the debt itself are projected to be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget in the years ahead.
597,"“It's as though they're now walking on two different tight ropes at once,” MacGuineas says of the Federal Reserve’s challenges to curb inflation without inflaming the debt even further."
598,A range of other economists weighed in this week on Yahoo Finance on the chances of a soft landing for the economy on the eve of the Fed’s latest decision.
599,"Vanguard Senior International Economist Andrew Patterson said Tuesday that a Fed-induced recession could be hard to avoid in 2023 but the coming downturn “is, based on the data, likely to be somewhat more mild in nature.”

 Citi U.S."
600,"Wealth Management Head of Investment Strategy Shawn Snyder added that if the economy sees signs of recession, such as consecutive monthly job losses, in coming months that could put the Fed ""in a more difficult place, and I think that will put them in perhaps a holding pattern."""
601,"The federal funds rate and the national debt
 Back in the early 1980s, then-Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker led the charge against inflation."
602,"While the central bank’s benchmark interest rate had soared to the teens back then, Volcker had an advantage because the government debt then constituted just around 30% of GDP."
603,"Today, the total debt has ballooned to around 120% of GDP."
604,"On Wednesday, officials are expected to raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.0% to 3.25% as part of an effort to bring inflation down from its current level of 8.3%."
605,The move would mark the third-straight 75-basis-point rate hike since June and bring rates to their highest level since 2008.
606,"In June, the CRFB analyzed the rate hikes up to that point and projected that annual interest costs will triple by 2032, up from nearly $400 billion now to $1.2 trillion next decade."
607,The total costs were projected to be $8.1 trillion over the next decade.
608,"""In reality, however, interest rates — and in turn interest costs — could be even higher,"" the authors added."
609,"Economic observers will watch closely for hints from the Fed of how high it will raise interest rates in the months ahead, either from current Chair Jerome Powell’s comments or when the Fed releases a summary of interest rate expectations known as the “dot plot.”
 ‘Two very reckless periods of excess borrowing’
 Speaking to Yahoo Finance, MacGuineas blamed the debt situation on spending binges from lawmakers in both parties."
610,She acknowledged the importance of spending trillions spent to combat COVID.
611,"But, she added, “That was sandwiched in between two very reckless periods of excess borrowing when we shouldn't have.”
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed by then-President Trump and more recent spending from the Biden administration have both driven current record-breaking deficits, she said."
612,"Her group has recently criticized Biden’s executive order to forgive student loans, projecting it will add around half a trillion dollars to the already sky-high deficits."

 In recent years, policymakers in both parties have downplayed debt concerns."
615,"Republicans have long argued that the 2017 tax cuts would pay for themselves, though that has not proven to be the case."
616,"Meanwhile, Democrats contend that deficits don’t matter; some cite the unorthodox economic principle known as Modern Monetary Theory, which posits the government can avoid the consequences of debt because it can print more money."
617,"“All of these arguments seduce politicians into believing they don't have to pay for things,” MacGuineas said."
618,"These theories, she added, have ""given a permission slip to politicians who are all too eager to grab it.”

620,"US central bank expected to raise rates by at least 0.75% in next round of fight against inflation
 I nvestors from London to New York and beyond are looking to Washington for an interest rate decision that will reverberate around the world and offer fresh insight into the next rounds in the global fight against inflation."
621,The biggest central bank of them all – The Federal Reserve – will announce its decision on US interest rates at 7 p.m. UK time.
622,"The only doubt is how big a hike it will approve: the 0.75% established at its last two meetings, or a super-sized 1% move, as some experts in the City and Wall Street have predicted."
623,"Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has repeatedly signalled his determination to tame inflation."
624,"Relatively robust economic data looks to give him more room for further aggressive action, while the latest reading of the US consumer price index (CPI) rose again last week, failing to meet hopes that it would show the first decline since May 2020."
625,Analysts say the lack of a clear sign that the Fed’s anti-inflation medicine has started to work in the last CPI opens the way for an even bigger rise.
626,"But into the start of trade on Wednesday, the CME’s Fedwatch tool put an 84% chance on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sticking with a hike of 0.75%."
627,"That has helped New York stock markets rise in opening trade, with the S&P 500 up just over 20 points at 3879.30 on Wall Street, where there has been much talk of a bigger move, which would be likely to spark volatility on stock markets."
628,"Greg Anderson, Director, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal, said: “We don’t think that Powell will push back against current market pricing, which basically has another 0.75% rate hike priced in."
629,"“We would assign a lower probability to the Fed hiking by 1% than the 20% that is priced into money market curves.”
 The dollar was stronger in the run up to the announcement, with the index tracking it against a range of other currencies up 0.5%."
630,"The pound was at fresh lows not seen since the 1980s, back under $1.14, as the dollar rose."
631,Futures trade indicated an opening gain of over 20 points for the S&P 500 stock index.
632,"Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The direction of interest rates is seen as vitally important to how investors allocate their capital between different asset classes, such as bonds, shares, property, commodities and cash."
633,"The return available on cash, and by extension the risk-free rate available on Government benchmark bonds, sets the reference point by which the attractiveness or otherwise of all asset classes will be judged,” he said."
634,"“Markets are pricing in a peak of around 4.50% by the FOMC meeting of May 2023, before the first cuts come in the second half of next year,” Mould added."
635,"The Fed adopted the 0.75% hike in June, for the first time since 1994."
636,"That came as a relief to stock market investors, where rising rates cause volatility and can improve the returns on offer from investment that are less risky than shares."
637,"The Fed has lifted rates at every single one of its meetings since March, taking the range of its target rates to 3% to 3.25%, the highest since 2008 in what has become the biggest rate tightening cycle since the 1980s."
638,"In 2020, CPI inflation was at 1.4%."
639,It reached 7% in 2021.

715,The Federal Reserve will probably announce another 0.75 percentage point interest-rate increase Wednesday.

717,"Investors will get some clues in the central bank’s updated summary of economic projections, or SEP, a quarterly set of forecasts that reflect where policy makers see interest rates, inflation, unemployment and gross domestic product heading."

 I nvestors from London to New York and beyond are looking to Washington for an interest rate decision that will reverberate around the world and offer fresh insight into the next rounds in the global fight against inflation."
720,The biggest central bank of them all – The Federal Reserve – will announce its decision on US interest rates at 7 p.m. UK time.
721,"The only doubt is how big a hike it will approve: the 0.75% established at its last two meetings, or a super-sized 1% move, as some experts in the City and Wall Street have predicted."
722,"Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has repeatedly signalled his determination to tame inflation."
723,"Relatively robust economic data looks to give him more room for further aggressive action, while the latest reading of the US consumer price index (CPI) rose again last week, failing to meet hopes that it would show the first decline since May 2020."
724,Analysts say the lack of a clear sign that the Fed’s anti-inflation medicine has started to work in the last CPI opens the way for an even bigger rise.
725,"But into the start of trade on Wednesday, the CME’s Fedwatch tool put an 84% chance on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sticking with a hike of 0.75%."
726,"That helped futures trade point to positive start to trade on Wall Street, where there has been much talk of a bigger move, which would be likely to spark volatility on stock markets."
727,"Greg Anderson, Director, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal, said: “We don’t think that Powell will push back against current market pricing, which basically has another 0.75% rate hike priced in."
728,"“We would assign a lower probability to the Fed hiking by 1% than the 20% that is priced into money market curves.”
 The dollar was stronger in the run up to the announcement, with the index tracking it against a range of other currencies up 0.5%."
729,"The pound was at fresh lows not seen since the 1980s, back under $1.14, as the dollar rose."
730,Futures trade indicated an opening gain of over 20 points for the S&P 500 stock index.
731,"Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The direction of interest rates is seen as vitally important to how investors allocate their capital between different asset classes, such as bonds, shares, property, commodities and cash."
732,"The return available on cash, and by extension the risk-free rate available on Government benchmark bonds, sets the reference point by which the attractiveness or otherwise of all asset classes will be judged,” he said."
733,"“Markets are pricing in a peak of around 4.50% by the FOMC meeting of May 2023, before the first cuts come in the second half of next year,” Mould added."
734,"The Fed adopted the 0.75% hike in June, for the first time since 1994."
735,"That came as a relief to stock market investors, where rising rates cause volatility and can improve the returns on offer from investment that are less risky than shares."
736,The Fed has lifted rates at every single one of its meetings since March in what has become the biggest rate tightening cycle since the 1980s.

742,"The British pound hit a new 37-year low at $1.1305, even as the Bank of England prepares to announce its own large interest rate hike Thursday."
743,"“The Fed is having to be cruel in order to restore price stability,” noted Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell."
744,"“Higher rates will cause pain to households and businesses, with the jobs market being closely watched for signs of redundancies and hiring freezes.”
 Most analysts are predicting that the Fed will announce another 75 basis-point lift, though some have tipped a full percentage-point move."
745,"In the event of no surprises, the US central bank’s forecast and post-meeting comments from boss Jerome Powell will be the main attraction for investors."
746,"“Volumes remain light and the mood cautious, with few looking to take on large positions before hearing what the Fed says,” according to Fiona Cincotta at City Index trading group."
747,Other central banks are meeting this week.
748,"On Tuesday, officials in Sweden surprised markets by unveiling a one percentage-point hike."
749,Adding to the cautious mood was Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation” as Russia’s president upped the ante in his battle against Ukraine.

 There's not a lot of mystery surrounding Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with markets widely expecting the central bank to approve its third consecutive three-quarter point interest rate hike."
760,"That doesn't mean there isn't considerable intrigue, though."
761,"related investing news There's one number that could be key to how markets trade right after the Fed meets With inflation still high, the Fed may be a long way from where it can stop hiking While the Fed almost certainly will deliver what the market has ordered, it has plenty of other items on its docket that will catch Wall Street's attention."
762,"Here's a quick rundown of what to expect from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting: Rates: In its continuing quest to tackle runaway inflation, the Fed almost certainly will approve a 0.75 percentage point hike that will take its benchmark rate up to a target range of 3%-3.25%."
763,That's the highest the fed funds rate has been since early 2008.
764,"Markets are pricing in a slight chance for a full 1 percentage point hike, something the Fed has never done since it started using the fed funds rate as its primary policy tool in 1990."
765,Economic outlook: Part of this week's meeting will see Fed officials issue their quarterly update of their interest rate and economic outlook.
766,"While the Summary of Economic Projections is not an official forecast, it does provide insight into where policymakers see various metrics and interest rates heading."
767,"The SEP includes estimates for GDP, unemployment and inflation as gauged by the personal consumption expenditures price index."
768,"watch now
 The ""dot plot"" and the ""terminal rate"": Investors will be most closely watching the so-called dot-plot of individual members' rate projections for the rest of 2022 and subsequent years, with this meeting's version extending for the first time into 2025."
769,"Included in that will be the projection for the ""terminal rate,"" or the point where officials think they can stop raising rates, which could be the most market-moving event of the meeting."
770,"In June, the committee put the terminal rate at 3.8%; it's likely to be at least half a percentage point higher following this week's meeting."
771,Powell presser: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his usual news conference following the conclusion of the two-day meeting.
772,"In his most notable remarks since the last meeting in July, Powell delivered a short, sharp address at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium in late August emphasizing his commitment to bringing down inflation and in particular his willingness to inflict ""some pain"" on the economy to make that happen."
773,New kids on the block: One slight wrinkle at this meeting is the input of three relatively new members: Governor Michael S. Barr and regional presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Susan Collins of Boston.
774,"Collins and Barr attended the previous meeting in July, but this will be their first SEP and dot plot."
775,"While individual names are not attached to projections, it will be interesting to see whether the new members are on board with the direction of Fed policy."
776,"The big picture
 Put it all together, and what investors will be watching most closely will be the meeting's tone – specifically how far the Fed is willing to go to tackle inflation and whether it is concerned about doing too much and taking the economy into a steeper recession."
777,"Judging by recent market action and commentary, the expectation is for a hawkish hardline."
778,"""Fighting inflation is job-one,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein."
779,"""The consequences of not fighting inflation are greater than the consequences of fighting it."
780,"If that means recession, then that's what it means."""
781,Winograd expects Powell and the Fed to stick to the Jackson Hole script that financial and economic stability are wholly dependent on price stability.
782,"In recent days, markets have begun to relinquish the belief that the Fed will only hike through this year then start cutting possibly by early or mid-2023."
783,"""If inflation is really stubborn and stays high, they may just have to grit their teeth and have a recession that lasts for a while,"" said Bill English, a professor at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed economist."
784,"""It's a very tough time to be a central banker right now, and they'll do their best."
785,"But it's hard."""
786,"The Fed has accomplished some of its goals toward tightening financial conditions, with stocks in retreat, the housing market slumping to the point of a recession and Treasury yields surging to highs not seen since the early days of the financial crisis."
787,"Household net worth fell more than 4% in the second quarter to $143.8 trillion, due largely to a decline in the valuation of stock market holdings, according to Fed data released earlier in September."
788,"However, the labor market has stayed strong and worker pay continues to rise, creating worries over a wage-price spiral even with gasoline costs at the pump in retreat."
789,"In recent days, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs conceded that the Fed may have to raise rates into 2023 to bring down prices."
790,"""The kind of door that the Fed is trying to get through, where they slow things down enough to get inflation down but not so much that they case a recession is a very narrow door and I think it has gotten narrower,"" English said."
791,"There's a corresponding scenario where inflation stays stubbornly high and the Fed has to keep raising, which he said is ""a very bad alternative down the road."""
792,The Federal Reserve will probably announce another 0.75% interest-rate increase.

803,"London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement represents a critical moment, as Wall Street waits to see how hard the central bank will go in its campaign to bring down stubbornly high inflation."
804,What's happening: The Fed is expected to raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday to a range of 3% to 3.25%.
805,But investors see some room for an even bigger hike.
806,"They're putting an 18% probability on a dramatic full-point increase, a move that would shock markets and bolster the narrative that the Fed will do whatever it takes to get inflation under control."
807,Arguments could be made for both options.
808,"One on hand, inflation remains uncomfortably elevated, with consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 8.3% in August ."
809,That indicates borrowing costs may need to head higher to bring down demand and stave off more trouble ahead.
810,Yet the Fed also knows it takes a while for past rate hikes to feed through the system.
811,"And if its playbook is too tough, it could trigger a damaging recession and widespread economic pain, as well as reduce its options for future meetings."
812,"""The faster the Fed hikes rates, the more likely they are to make a mistake,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, senior US rates strategist at TD Securities, told me."
813,"A larger question also looms: Can the central bank retain confidence that it will successfully bring inflation to heel, a primary reason for its existence?"
814,"Faith in the Fed was rocked by Chair Jerome Powell's mistaken emphasis that inflation was ""transitory."""
815,That incorrect assessment meant the Fed was delayed in addressing the problem and has to be more aggressive now.
816,"Since then, some credibility has been restored."
817,"Bond market expectations for longer-term inflation have come down sharply in recent months, a sign these investors think the Fed is doing its job."
818,Take a look: Compare the yield on standard US Treasury bonds with those protected against inflation.
819,The difference — known as the breakeven rate — tells you how much inflation investors foresee.
820,"The five-year breakeven rate stands at 2.48%, down significantly from a high of 3.59% in March and not far off from the Fed's 2% target."
821,The 10-year breakeven inflation rate sits at 2.4%.
822,"""A lot of that has had to do with the Fed's very hawkish tone and their promise to keep hiking rates until inflation is back under control,"" Goldberg said."
823,"Still, he warned it's way too soon to ""declare mission accomplished."""
824,"""It's a very tenuous restoration of that confidence and of that faith in the Fed,"" Goldberg said."
825,"""The difficulty now is the Fed has to follow through."
826,"It's easy to promise to be hawkish or to be very aggressive in the pace of tightening policy, but you're really forced to deliver that tightening at the end of the day."""
827,"Dollar reaches new 20-year high as Putin escalates war
 The latest: In a televised national address Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin announced an immediate partial mobilization of Russian citizens and threatened to use ""all the means at our disposal"" to defend Russia ""and our people."""
828,He also referenced the potential use of nuclear weapons.
829,The speech pushed the greenback up 0.4% against a basket of major currencies to its strongest level since 2002.
830,Investors often seek safe haven in US dollar assets during times of geopolitical tension.
831,Oil prices also jumped.
832,"Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, gained more than 2%, rising to just below $93 per barrel."
833,"The war has added to stress for investors, since it makes it harder to predict when inflation will ease and could push central banks to maintain an aggressive tack for longer."
834,It's also added to uncertainty around energy supplies.
835,"While gas reserves in Germany have been filled to 90% capacity, concerns remain."
836,"Robert Habeck, Germany's minister for economic affairs, said that the country could ""get through winter well"" without Russian gas, but warned of ""really empty"" supply levels in the period thereafter."
837,And costs are rising.

857,"The Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates at its September meeting Wednesday in order to fight high inflation
 The Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time."
858,"WASHINGTON -- Last month, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he issued a blunt warning: The Fed's drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates, he said, would ""bring some pain"" for Americans."
859,"When the Fed ends its latest meeting Wednesday and Powell holds a news conference, Americans will likely get a better idea of how much pain could be in store."
860,The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time.
861,"Another hike that large would boost its benchmark rate - which affects many consumer and business loans - to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years."
862,"Many Fed watchers, though, will be paying particular attention to Powell's words at a news conference afterward."
863,His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months - or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it's convinced that inflation is on its way down.
864,"In a further sign of the Fed's deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year's end than it had forecast three months ago - and to keep them higher for longer."
865,Economists expect Fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4% before the new year.
866,"They're also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%."
867,"Short-term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans."
868,The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures.
869,Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.
870,The economy hasn't seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis.
871,"Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years."
872,"Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com."
873,"Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed's goal is to achieve a ""soft landing,"" by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession."
874,"By last week, though, that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported that inflation over the past year was a painful 8.3%."
875,"Even worse, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose much faster than expected."

 The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation."

905,"While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00 per cent-3.25 per cent range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement."
906,"Those projections will show where Fed policymakers think interest rates are heading, how long it will take inflation to fall, and how much “pain” is likely to be inflicted on U.S. employment and economic growth along the way."
907,"If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4 per cent by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4 per cent that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment."
908,"“With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed’s commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week."
909,"“They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.”
 Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. central bank to eventually need to raise its policy rate to around 5.00 per cent, a level approaching the peak of 5.25 per cent seen from mid-2006 to 2007 when Fed policymakers were concerned about a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and one that could amplify stress across the global financial system."
910,"Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to elaborate on the latest policy decision, and his tone will shape whether it is interpreted as a hawkish next step with more of the same ahead, or as a final bit of rate-hike “front-loading” before the Fed reverts to more conventional rate increases of 50 or 25 basis points as it feel its way to a stopping point."

914,"The Fed chief’s tone since then has become ardently hawkish, and, with the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation running more than three times its 2 per cent target, another dose of tough talk is anticipated."
915,"“Risks still skew toward higher terminal policy rates and we expect a relatively hawkish FOMC meeting,” Citi economists wrote on Tuesday."
916,"The hawkish stance has become the norm globally as central bankers dial up interest rate moves not seen since the 1990s, at the tail end of a fight in the developed world against inflation that had become entrenched in the 1970s."

919,"Such increases in borrowing costs can feed off each other, changing currency, price and trade dynamics in ways that prompt other central banks to react, particularly in emerging markets where exchange rate fluctuations and rising dollar interest rates can cause unexpected financial shocks."
920,"Led by the Fed’s intensifying focus on fighting inflation, the tightening has become so pronounced that some have begun worrying about overkill."
921,"“Central banks nearly everywhere feel accused of being on the back foot,” in failing to anticipate to prevent the jump of inflation in 2021, Maurice Obstfeld, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an essay last week published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics."

970,"They're also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%."

972,The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures.
973,Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.

1052,"UNEMPLOYMENT FORECAST IN FOCUS
 And while the new quarterly summary of policymaker projections may appear to rule out a Volcker-style ""hard"" landing, it is widely expected to point to notably higher unemployment and slower economic growth in the coming year that by at least one well-known benchmark could signal a recession of some stripe."
1053,"That benchmark, known as the Sahm Rule after former Fed staffer Claudia Sahm who identified and formalized it, says the U.S. economy is typically in recession once the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the rate's lowest three-month average over the preceding 12 months."

1064,"The Fed instead kept the policy rate at near zero until December 2015, when it lifted it by just a quarter of a percentage point."
1065,"This time around, though, financial markets are pricing in a top Fed funds rate of 4.5% next year, with a rate cut or two seen as more than likely toward the second half of 2023."

1116,"Beyond that, investors will be focused on what Powell has to say, both in the Fed's latest interest rate policy statement and during an afternoon press conference, for clues as to whether the central bank remains primarily focused on lowering inflation, or if there's a hint the Fed is giving more consideration to the impact of higher rates on the economy."

 The housing market has slowed from a red-hot pace as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises interest rates
 The U.S. housing market slowed for a seventh straight month in August, the longest stretch of declining sales since 2007, as higher mortgage rates continued to undercut buyer demand."
1174,"Home sales look poised to decline further in the coming months, economists say, as mortgage rates recently topped 6% for the first time since 2008, when the U.S. was in a recession."
1175,"Many first-time buyers have been priced out of the market, and existing homeowners are opting to stay put rather than give up their current low rates."
1176,The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.00%-3.25% on Wednesday and signaled more large increases to come in new projections showing its policy rate rising to 4.40% by the end of this year before topping out at 4.60% in 2023 to battle continued strong inflation.

 MATT STUCKY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANY, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN
 ""The big takeaway here is not so much the decision to raise by 75 basis points."
1188,"In terms of discussion in the statement, we have been thinking about the Federal Reserve policy as moving in one direction but increasingly, as they've moved into hawkish territory as markets have started to pencil in a terminal fed funds rate in 2023 approaching four and a half percent, that we might start to get at least an acknowledgement that the risks are becoming two-sided in terms of monetary policy stance."
1189,"Certainly there are risks of inflation, but the opposite side of that is there are risks to the overall economy...there continues to be, at least so far, not any kind of concrete acknowledgement that risks are growing to the forward economic outlook..."
1190,The Fed remains singularly focused on fighting inflation.
1191,"So this is a pretty hawkish 75 basis point increase when it comes to how the text reads."""
1192,"LINDSEY BELL, CHIEF MARKETS & MONEY STRATEGIST, ALLY
 ""The 75 basis points increase was expected."
1193,What the market is reacting to is the update to expectations for rates for the out-years.
1194,They moved significantly higher ...
1195,The market would've liked to see the number come down in 2023.
1196,"What it's telling us is that the Fed is expecting to rates to continue to move higher into 2023."""
1197,"""The silver lining is that six members think rates are going to stay steady and one thinks they can come down in 2023."""
1198,"""Now the question is what is the market is going to price in here."
1199,What do we really believe will happen?
1200,There's a camp that says whatever the Fed guides to has typically been the floor and not the ceiling.
1201,This communication is basically signaling that the Fed's going to continue to be aggressive and remain hawkish.
1202,That's going to continue to put pressure on stocks.
1203,"It doesn't leave a lot of room to the upside for investors going into the end of the year."""
1204,"""Right now it doesn't feel great because the Fed's going to stay hawkish."
1205,They're not backing down.
1206,"Where we end the day is going to be predicated on Powell's speech."""
1207,"BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
 “The unusual has become usual."
1208,"Not only did the Fed hike another unusually large 75 bps today, it is basically saying it will do it again in November."
1209,"Thinking that these types of hikes aren’t going to cause pain down the road is the triumph of hope over experience.”
 ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 “The stock market is taking this in stride, it did go down a little bit but it’s not too dramatic."
1210,"The updated statement of economic projections suggest that the Fed is reluctantly, slowly, catching up to reality in terms of their anticipation for everything – for inflation, for core inflation, for GDP."
1211,"You look at the difference between December, to march, to June, to now, in all of those metrics and what they are projecting and they are finally catching up with what the market has already known for quite some time."
1212,"So perhaps the equity market was a little bit optimistic they might soften the language, which they did not do, but in general most of this was priced into the equity market."
1213,"""A lot of times you see (the market) do something on the day of and then something else the next day, investors might want to reserve judgment until tomorrow.”
 THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NYC
 “This is as hawkish as it gets and the only way to back off it is in the press conference if Powell says we're going to remain data dependent.”
 “As we found through history, the initial knee jerk reaction tends to be wrong."
1214,But markets really do want to see Powell signal some flexibility moving forward in order to kind of stabilize the market.
1215,"So I think you want to hear him say 'data dependent,' 'flexible,' but at the same time stand firm in terms of their commitment to bring inflation down.”
 RYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CARSON GROUP, OMAHA
 “It was a rather hawkish 75 basis point hike, and (the Fed) left the door wide open for even more rate hikes before the end of the year.”
 “The dot plots confirm more hikes are coming than were previously expected."
1216,"“The Fed is willing to produce a good deal of pain to the economy, and potentially to the stock market in order to rein in the runaway inflation we’ve been seeing this year.”
 “The economic expectations from the Fed are quite disappointing."
1217,"The economy is quickly slowing.”
 “Yields and the dollar both moved higher on the hawkish Fed stance, pressuring stocks once again.”
 ""The Fed is willing to produce a good deal of pain to the economy and potentially the stock market in order to rein in the runaway inflation we’ve been seeing this year."""

1223,Dealerships offer clues.
1224,"The Fed could raise rates so much that it snuffs out demand, but given how much pent-up car-buying appetite exists, Mr. Murphy thinks it would take a lot."
1225,"“You probably would have to go farther on rates than they have so far, or even than they are expected to go,” he said."
1226,"“There may be a point at which you have enough pain that you see a pause on demand.”
 If demand continues to outstrip new-car supply and dealers continue to reap big profits, that could limit how quickly inflation will ease."
1227,"If the mismatch is large enough for sellers to keep pushing up prices without losing customers, it could even continue to fuel inflation."
1228,"While the car market is just one industry, the uncertainty of its return to normal holds a few lessons for the Fed."
1229,"For one thing, new-car production makes it clear that supply chain disruptions are improving but not gone."
1230,"More hopefully, the car industry could offer evidence that the laws of economics are likely to reassert themselves eventually."
1231,"Used-car prices have at least stopped their ascent as inventory has grown, and experts say discounting is likely around the corner."
1232,"If that happens, it could be evidence that companies won’t be able to keep prices and profits high indefinitely once supply catches up with demand."
1233,But cars reinforce the prospect that the readjustment period could last a while.
1234,Automakers are flirting with the idea of keeping production lower so there are fewer cars in the market and price cuts are less common.
1235,Mr.
1236,Smoke is skeptical that they will hold that line once it means ceding market share to competitors — but the process could take months or years.
1237,"“I’m hesitant to say that we won’t have discounting again,” Mr."
1238,Smoke said.
1239,"“But it’s going to take a while to get back to that world.”
