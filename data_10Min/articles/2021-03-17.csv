Fears that $1.9 trillion dollar stimulus would overheat the economy have triggered a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields, derailing Wall Street’s main indexes from their peaks last month.
The Fed is expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The meet will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, where he is likely to reassure the economy can take off without generating excessive inflation.
While the Fed has reiterated it will remain dovish till the labor market fully recovers, eurodollar futures, which track short-term rate expectations, have priced a 90% chance of a rate hike by December 2022, with three hikes seen in 2023.
“Fed is more willing to allow inflation to run hot at the same time it wants to bond markets to not run past the current level,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
“If the Fed hints they would buy bonds at the longer end of the (Treasury yield) curve, it would help equities rally.”

The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 64.02 points, or 1 percent, to 6,630.85 on a value turnover of P8.8 billion. Gainers overwhelmed losers, 149 to 64, with 41 issues unchanged. Puregold Price Club Inc. of retail tycoon Lucio Co advanced 5.2 percent to P36.20, while SM Prime Holdings Inc. of the Sy Group climbed 3.7 percent to P36.30. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co., the second-biggest lender in terms of assets, rose 3.5 percent to P47.60, while Bank of the Philippine Islands, the third-largest bank, added 2.6 percent to P85.95. The rest of the Asian equities rallied. With growth already expected to burst higher this year, huge stimulus spending kicking in and vaccines being rolled out, investors have in recent weeks grown worried about a surge in inflation that could force the central bank to reconsider its dovish stance. But the Fed’s decision after its latest board meeting was music to the ears of traders. Policymakers forecast the world’s top economy to expand 6.5 percent this year, two percentage points above its earlier projection, thanks to trillions of dollars in government spending and the expected easing of lockdown measures that will allow people to get back to their daily lives. And, crucially, they continued to pledge that the record low interest rates that have been a key pillar of the year-long markets rally will not be touched for the foreseeable future. Wall Street rallied on the news, with the Dow ending above 33,000 for the first time, while the S&P 500 also chalked up a record.Asian trading floors were also upbeat. Hong Kong jumped 1.3 percent and Tokyo put on one percent, while Singapore and Jakarta put on more than one percent. Shanghai, Seoul, Taipei, and Bangkok also rose. Bank boss Jerome Powell told a news conference that while the recovery had been faster than expected, “the economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.” The Fed “will continue to provide the economy the support it needs for as long as it takes,” he said. And while some board members were edging towards a rate hike by 2023, investors were cheered by projections that borrowing costs will likely stay where they are until possibly 2024, even if inflation surges. “The overarching message from the Summary of Economic Projections and Chair Powell’s press conference was of greater optimism on the outlook but a central bank that is not in a hurry to raise rates,” said Axi strategist Stephen Innes. With AFP And Tai Hui, at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the Fed justified its decision to maintain its policy position by saying the impact of Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion will be felt this year and the economy would revert to normal from 2022. “It remains to be seen if this will be enough to convince investors with more hawkish inflation expectations, who may be fretting about a sustained rise in consumer prices,” he added.",https://manilastandard.net/business/business-stocks/349809/market-rises-for-third-day-puregold-sm-prime-climb.html

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are betting the economy can take off from the COVID-19 pandemic without generating excessive inflation, and have vowed to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and a spigot of money flowing for an extended period as they lean into a potential economic boom in a way not seen since the early 1970s.
In each of the quarterly forecasts released since June, the median GDP growth projection of Fed officials has been slightly above the median of private forecasters polled by Reuters. If that holds, it would translate into expected growth this year of more than 6.2% - the highest annual rate in 37 years.
GRAPHIC: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook -
But when they issue their policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials are expected to restate what they’ve promised for months now: to keep the central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and cash flowing into the economy until Americans are back to work, trusting that inflation will remain contained, as it has been for about 30 years.
The economic projections and policy statement are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell will hold a news conference shortly after, an event that could prove tricky for the Fed chief.
Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected. Some policymakers could even hint at that if new projections show more of them anticipate a rate increase sometime in 2023, rather than a year or more later.
If a majority see a 2023 hike, “Powell will have his work cut out for him” explaining how that meshes with a promise to get the economy back to full employment before reducing the crisis support rolled out when the pandemic struck, Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors, wrote this week.
Still, investors are already betting on earlier hikes, and some economists are also raising a red flag along with their forecasts. Morgan Stanley, among the more bullish in predicting the economy will have fully escaped its pandemic hole by September, sees the Fed’s approach producing a “hotter but shorter” business cycle that is likely to prompt it to tighten monetary policy early next year.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields hit a fresh 13-month high and U.S. stocks were trading largely lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the Fed meeting.
The coming cycle would be less like the last three expansions - the one ended by the pandemic lasted a decade - and more like the period after World War Two when the intervals between recessions were shorter and intervening growth stronger.
That epoch ended when then-President Richard Nixon encouraged loose monetary policy ahead of his 1972 re-election. Arthur Burns, who was the Fed chief at the time, kept interest rates low as the economy accelerated, and is often blamed for the ensuing rampant inflation that dogged the country for a decade.
This time is different, Fed officials argue. Indeed, Powell’s legacy may hinge on whether inflation remains tame as the economy recovers, or whether prices spike, forcing the central bank to pull back its support - perhaps with millions of Americans still out of work.
Their arguments are well-rehearsed. Inflation and unemployment don’t behave as they used to; lower levels of joblessness can now coexist with low inflation.
The Fed made substantial changes to its policy statement last year encompassing that thinking, and the guidance issued in December is expected to hold for now. It pledged to continue its monthly $120 billion of bond purchases until there was “substantial further progress” towards full employment and 2% inflation. Moreover, it said interest rates would not increase until those goals were actually met.
None of those things have happened yet, a point Powell has stressed recently and will likely again on Wednesday. The economy remains about 9 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level; the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, at 1.5%, is well short of its goal; a new index of slow-moving inflation expectations is also below target.
GRAPHIC: Substantial further progress for the Fed? -
‘CLEAR-EYED’
Still, it is a pivotal moment as Fed officials issue forecasts incorporating a bounty of new information.
Since their December projections, more than 100 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States and daily deaths due to the virus have fallen by two-thirds. Optimism has spiked, and states have begun lifting restrictions on businesses and reopening schools. Washington also has approved two new relief packages worth about $2.8 trillion, money now rolling into household and business bank accounts.
Much has changed since the Burns era, when wages and inflation were tightly linked, the economy relied more on manufacturing and imported oil, and unforeseen shocks from an oil embargo were just ahead. [Related graphic: here]
The Fed’s new approach, moreover, isn’t an in-the-moment response to political pressure, but a policy shift meant to reflect changes in the economy officials spent years studying.
With an emphasis on job creation and downplaying inflation, the new framework seemed well suited for the job market crisis spawned by the pandemic. The issue now is how it meshes with an economy that may recover faster than thought possible.
Analysts at BlackRock have praised the Fed for being “clear-eyed” about the economy’s problems during the pandemic and in its response to it.
But, wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, “at some point, the financial stability risks that emanate from an extremely low policy rate, coupled with the real economy boom that we expect, could in fact force the Fed’s hand.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/wrapup-2-fed-likely-to-forecast-biggest-economic-boom-in-a-generation-idUSL1N2LE1D0

But, wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, “at some point, the financial stability risks that emanate from an extremely low policy rate, coupled with the real economy boom that we expect, could in fact force the Fed’s hand.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/fed-likely-to-forecast-biggest-economic-boom-in-a-generation-idUSKBN2B90KE

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
“The spike in U.S. yields dictated the positioning before the Fed,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, at online FX broker OANDA.
“The market is anticipating a much more optimistic outlook by the Fed and with that you’re going to get higher Treasury yields, and that would be supportive for the dollar,” he added.
The U.S. benchmark 10-year note yield rose to a 13-month peak of 1.676% and was last up at 1.655%.

The Russian rouble weakened by more than 1% after U.S. President Joe Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will “pay a price” for directing efforts to meddle in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Fed policymakers are expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades as COVID-19 vaccinations rise and a $1.9 trillion relief package aids households.
Ahead of the Fed statement expected at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.676%.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”
On Wall Street, the rise in bond yields continued to pressure stocks, including tech and growth shares.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.85 points, or 0.02%, to 32,833.8, the S&P 500 lost 16.06 points, or 0.41%, to 3,946.65 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 96.22 points, or 0.71%, to 13,375.35.
“Market is of the view that the 10-year yield could be higher and if the Fed signals anything that matches that view, we could see yields jump past the 2% mark,” said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.51% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.43%.
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 1.6497%, from 1.623% late on Tuesday.

Fears that massive stimulus would overheat the economy has triggered a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields, derailing Wall Street’s main indexes from their peaks last month.
The Fed is expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). The meet will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference, where he is likely to reassure the economy can take off without generating excessive inflation.
While the Fed has reiterated it will remain dovish till the labor market fully recovers, some policymakers could hint at an increase in rates in 2023. Some investors and economists are betting on even earlier rate hikes, with Morgan Stanley predicting a tightening of monetary policy early next year.
“I don’t think investors believe that the Fed is going to change its stance but there are fears for inflation to jump in the near term,” said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with an upgrade to GDP growth. Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected in raising rates.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have jumped from 0.953% at the beginning of the year to 1.67% on Wednesday, in the midst of the two-day policy meeting that began on Tuesday. The rise in yields in recent weeks came on optimism about the economic recovery and as the United States readied new fiscal stimulus.
However, a rapid rise in yields can ripple through to other assets, affecting everything from tech and financial stocks to the housing market.
Investors hoping for action from the Fed to cap rising yields on longer-dated Treasuries may be disappointed. While Powell has said he is watching recent Treasury market volatility, he brushed off concerns that the move up in yields might spell trouble for the Fed.
Here are what analysts are saying as the Fed meets:
MIZUHO SECURITIES USA
“There is a risk that the markets will again be disappointed by the post-meeting policy statement,” wrote Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC.
“The Fed’s new operating procedure of targeting maximum employment to finally achieve its 2% average inflation target is designed to see inflation expectations and long-term rates rise. This means policymakers are supportive of recent market developments, i.e. rising long-term rates,” he wrote.
RABOBANK
“The risks are... that long yields react further to all this “running hot,” wrote Michael Every, senior macro strategist, Rabobank. Even “a moderate move higher in yields could be painful – and not just to bonds,” Every wrote.
ING
""Bond investors will be wary of perceptions that the Fed could potentially allow the economy to run too hot for too long,"" wrote here James Knightley, Padhraic Garvey and Chris Turner, at ING, noting that inflation is ""set to accelerate to well above 3%.
HSBC SECURITIES
“We expect the FOMC’s economic and rate projections will be in line with the bond market’s expectations,” wrote Lawrence Dyer, head of U.S. rates strategy and Shrey Singhal, fixed income strategist. “And, we do not expect the FOMC statement or press conference to provide pushback to the recent increase in yields. Thus, there should be a moderate market reaction to the announcement and press conference.”
STANDARD CHARTERED BANK
“We think the FOMC will have a hard time expressing concern about asset markets,” wrote Steve Englander and John Davies at Standard Chartered, while adding that if the Fed’s policy-setting committee and Powell do not “push back against current yield levels, investors are likely to take yields higher as better data arrives.”
NATWEST MARKETS
“Broader financial conditions remain easy, and luckily for (Powell) the U.S. rates market just got through a week of long supply relatively unscathed, at least until Friday, and Friday’s move did not negatively impact risk,” wrote John Briggsglobal head of strategy, NatWest Markets.
“What I do expect is for Powell to push back against the recent rise in the front end, dot move or not, which has pushed market pricing for the first hike to December 2022, from September 2023 at the beginning of the year.”
BANK OF AMERICA
“The Fed likely hopes market pricing is right, since it implies a faster recovery and more rapid attainment of its inflation and employment goals,” wrote Michelle Meyer, Mark Cabana, Ben Randol, Meghan Swiber and Stephen Juneau at Bank of America.
“Powell is likely to reiterate that higher rates are consistent with a re-pricing of fundamentals... Limited pushback on rate hike pricing will also likely be a disappointment for those expecting a continued ultra-dovish Fed, supporting higher belly rates.”

The benchmark 10-year yield ticked up to a new 13-month high of 1.671%, denting demand for some high-growth technology stocks and pressuring futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 by about 1%.
Fears that massive stimulus would overheat economy has triggered a rapid spike in long-duration Treasury yields, derailing Wall Street’s main indexes from their peaks last month.
The Fed is expected to issue a blowout GDP forecast for 2021 at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). It will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference shortly after, where he is likely to reassure the economy can take off without generating excessive inflation.
While the Fed has reiterated it will remain dovish till the labor market fully recovers, some policymakers could hint at an increase in rates in 2023. Some investors and economists are betting on even earlier rate hikes, with Morgan Stanley predicting a tightening of monetary policy early next year.
“I don’t think the Fed is going to change their stance but even if they are too strong about the economy, it could spook markets so it’s a very fine line,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director of the Wealth Alliance in New York.

World stocks meanwhile headed lower and Russia’s rouble fell sharply after comments from U.S. President Joe Biden that Russian President Vladimir Putin “would pay a price” for election interference.
But market volatility is being contained by the upcoming Fed policy statement.
The central bank is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow at the fastest rate in decades in 2021 thanks to a $1.9 trillion fiscal boost and COVID-19 vaccine rollout. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy will probably be disappointed.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”
Before the Fed statement at 1800 GMT, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a fresh high at 1.67%, up more than 3 basis points on the day.
BIDEN VS PUTIN
Comments from Biden that Russia’s Putin will face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump caused some unease in markets.
U.S. stock market futures, which had been steady for much of the London session, slipped, pointing to a weak open for Wall Street. That in turn pressured European shares.
Russia’s rouble extended losses, falling more than 1% against the U.S. dollar, while bonds also faced selling pressure.
“There will be more sanctions coming, that is clear. The question is, how severe,” said North Asset Management fund manager Peter Kisler.
MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.2%, but still within sight of last month’s record highs. In Asia, an index of regional equities excluding Japan pulled back 0.4%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed flat.
There was some good news for AstraZeneca as Australia’s pharmaceutical regulator said rollout of the company’s COVID-19 shot would continue, even though many European nations have paused vaccinations to investigate reported side-effects.
BOND WATCHING
The rise in benchmark 10-year Treasury yields is the focal point for markets, coming ahead of the Fed statement.
They have risen 76 basis points so far this year versus a 26 bps increase in German peers and a 7 bps rise in Japanese borrowing costs.
Inflation expectations have also ticked higher, with the break-even rate on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) rising above 2.3% on Tuesday for the first time since July 2014. The break-even rate for 30-year TIPS hit 2.24%, the highest since September 2014.

“The question is whether (Fed chief) Jerome Powell sees the steepening of the U.S. yield curve as appropriate,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
“The forecasts are likely to be revised up so it is hard to argue that the yield curve steepening is not appropriate. We have seen an increase in breakeven inflation in TIPS, too.”

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
In any event, expectations of a faster-than-expected economic recovery will likely weigh.
“U.S. yields might receive further upwards thrust and pull the dollar along with them in the absence of a clear commitment on the part of the Fed that a further rise in yields is undesirable”, Commerzbank analyst Antje Praefcke wrote in a morning note.
She added that because the European Central Bank had in contrast committed to increasing the pace of bond buying to keep a lid on rising yields, the euro might suffer against the dollar in the short term.
By midday in Europe, Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields had crossed the 1.67% bar, their highest level since February 2020.
The euro was down 0.05% at $1.1896 after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.1835.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
“There is a risk that public trust on the vaccine has been compromised, and this may weigh on the euro as the vaccination gap between the EU and US may widen even further,” ING analysts warned.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies, which seem less dependent on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
At 1155 GMT, the dollar index was up 0.09% and stood at 91.952, having already risen for three straight sessions on support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields.
The rouble fell 1.5% against the dollar to 73.78 after U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin would face consequences for directing efforts to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve has made it clear it is too soon to think about pulling back on stimulus for the pandemic-battered economy, but finds itself stuck between an improving outlook and inflation fears.
The US central bank will wrap up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, where it will likely comment on the accelerations in COVID-19 vaccine campaigns and reopening of businesses, which are fueling optimism that life in the United States can return to normal.

And into that improving economy comes a flood of government funds: A US$1.9 trillion relief package President Joe Biden signed last week, and the remainder of the US$900 billion measure approved in December.
Economists expect that influx of cash to shore up businesses and boost spending, but markets worry it will bring with it an upward spiral of prices.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance at his post-meeting news conference to allay those concerns and repeat his assertion that while prices will rise this year, any spikes from the depressed levels of 2020 will be transitory and no reason for the bank to take action.
In fact, the Fed wants prices to rise to some extent, since they have lagged below its 2 per cent target for years.

The Fed faces ""a delicate balancing act,"" BNP Paribas chief economist William De Vijlder said.
Members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are expected to raise their economic projections from December to take into account the stimulus and improving outlook.
But De Vijlder said that will just ""add fuel to the fire"" of potential price increases and cause yields on US Treasury debt to rise again - the inflationary red flag that has sent stock markets on a roller-coaster ride in recent weeks.
Powell has made it clear the Fed will wait until employment has recovered and inflation is securely above 2 per cent before it will roll back its easy money policy.

The Fed will release new economic and interest rate forecasts, which could indicate Fed officials expect to raise rates by, or even before, 2023. The central bank is expected to acknowledge stronger growth, which should put the Fed's easy policies in the spotlight, especially given the new $1.9 trillion in federal stimulus spending.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday morning, that he would be ""astonished"" if the Fed signaled that it would step in to dampen rising bond yields at these levels.
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen rapidly recently amid concerns about potential growth in inflation, as economies reopen and recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The 10-year yield has jumped more than half a percent since the end of January, hitting 1.6% in the past couple of weeks.
However, Shepherdson highlighted that this was ""still close to zero in real terms.""
Shepherdson believed that while Powell would once again push back on some of the market's inflation fears, he suggested the Fed chairman wouldn't talk about tapering its bond buying program in Wednesday's press conference.
He explained that this is because ""as soon as the Fed starts talking about tapering, then yields will rocket immediately because that's what markets do — you give markets an inch and they take a yard — especially in Treasuries at moment.""
""So the Fed therefore I think wants to keep this talk really dampened down as much as they possibly can until they can't,"" he added.
Shepherdson pointed out that this lack of indication from the Fed on when any policy changes might come was ""kind of justifiable because this recovery is still a forecast.""

What’s not for the Fed to like?

Part of the market narrative of recent weeks has been that the Fed had somehow lost control of the U.S. Treasury bond market, allowing traders to become restive due to a lack of hard guidance, fear of excessive stimulus and inflation anxiety.
As borrowing rates backed up to pre-pandemic levels - already historically low levels before COVID-19 hit - and unsettled stock markets that have lapped up the idea of emergency borrowing rates for years to come, Fed officials refused to protest the move or offer the prospect of even more support.
Fed policymakers, who are concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, may well address technical money market disturbances from the rundown of Treasury’s bank account at the U.S. central bank - something flooding banks with excess reserves and raising questions about extending relief on their resulting purchases of more Treasury securities.
But even if this factor was the root of recent bond market ructions, the Fed’s fundamental message on its new average inflation targetting regime seems to be getting through just fine.
Not only are Fed officials expecting a temporary snapback in inflation to as high as 3% over the coming year, they are positively targetting 2%-plus so their average target is met by a symmetric period above that level matching the long periods stuck below it.
That’s the whole point of the strategy rethink - allowing the economy to run hot for periods to eat up accumulated slack and joblessness from periods of sluggish or sub-par growth.
And so while inflation fears grip the headlines, bond market pricing merely apes that objective rather than threatening it.
With oil prices more than double where they were at the nadir of the first pandemic-related lockdowns last year, forecast base effects on headline inflation will be sparky and unpredictable for several months - possibly even exaggerated later in the year by bottlenecks during the re-opening of shuttered services and travel.
But expectations embedded in inflation-protected bonds and in swaps markets show the five-year view similar to one-year indications of inflation around 2.50%.
While that’s a percentage point higher than 2019 levels and the highest since just before the banking crash of 2008, it’s in the ballpark of what the Fed’s been aiming at and shows just how long expectations skulked below target for the past decade.
Crucially, 10-year and 30-year equivalent expectations subside again to about 2.20/2.25%. And 10- and 30-year nominal bond yields of 1.6% and 2.4% are hardly excessive given they have room to move higher without cries about disjointed pricing.
It seems unlikely the Fed will be unnerved by a wobble in a stock market that is still near record highs and where worries about bubbles and one-way pricing were the bigger investor and policymaker fears only a month ago.

FED IN CONTROL?
Where there is a challenge to Fed communication is market pricing for an interest rate hike at the tail end of next year - an aggressive take that flies in the face of the central bank’s signals that no move is likely on interest rates until 2023.
Were the Fed to push back hard on that, perhaps relatively benign inflation thinking may go up a notch too.
Beyond this week’s policy meeting, a wider worry is that what’s good for the Fed may not be for the rest of the world and the latter comes back to haunt Washington anyhow.
That’s partly a result of the still dominant role of the dollar and U.S. Treasury market in world finance - something Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet Yellen has previously said influenced Fed thinking in the past.
Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen thinks that should throw down the gauntlet to global fiscal authorities to mirror the ambition of President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion spending package, which was enacted last week.
“For now, Biden and the Fed can sit back a bit and enjoy the spectacle of a much faster U.S. recovery, while the world of foreign governments, central banks and markets try to figure out how to react to this new and bold U.S. policy approach.”
But angst about loose policy settings and markets fighting the Fed remain largely a discussion of risk than a reality of pricing.
Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey showed more than 90% of respondents think “higher than expected inflation” is the biggest tail risk to investor positioning and a bond market “tantrum” the second.
Yet at the same time, they reckoned the 10-year Treasury bond would need to rise another 40 basis points to trigger even a 10% equity correction.
Deutsche Bank’s latest global outlook sees that yield move happening by the summer. But it reckoned a persistent overshoot of U.S. inflation in the 3% to 4% range would be needed to “elicit a strong response from the Fed” that would hit world markets hard.
As it stands - its central forecast is for U.S. inflation to end this year at 2.6% before subsiding to 2.1% by 2023.
And if that proves to be the case, the Fed can remain smug that it’s getting what it wants.

The U.S. central bank ends a closely anticipated two-day meeting later in the day, after a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields this year on expectations for stronger growth and inflation.

The U.S. central bank ends a closely anticipated two-day meeting later in the day, after a sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields this year on expectations for stronger growth and inflation.
The Fed is expected to forecast that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy will probably be disappointed.
“This is one of the most important Fed meetings we’ve had for some time and the impact will be felt across asset classes,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
“Markets are hoping for reassurance from the Fed that rising bond yields are not something to worry about, and that takes a bit of steam out of the bond market.”

European stocks were set to open weaker, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.1 per cent. FTSE futures also edged lower in early deals.
Global markets have been knocked in recent weeks by a rout in treasuries that saw the benchmark yield soar to a more than one-year high as bond investors bet accelerating Covid-19 vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus would spur faster-than-expected growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.
The volatility stoked speculation the Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment to the levers controlling its policy rate, but few expect the central bank to act on the matter at this week’s meeting, even if it releases rosier growth forecasts.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.3% lower, trading below a one-year peak after a cautious session in Asian markets.
The Fed’s monetary policy stance will be closely watched after a recent run-up in Treasury yields stoked concerns about a pick-up in inflation as the U.S. economy rebounds from pandemic lows. The central bank’s policy statement and economic forecasts are due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
“The Fed at this point probably thinks that the impact of the high yield is relatively modest on the stock market,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at BCA Research in London.
“They will stick to their narrative, and only if there is a big sort of pushback in the market crisis, would they intervene aggressively.”

After touching its highest in nearly seven months last session, the rouble fell 0.2% following a U.S. intelligence report that showed Moscow likely directed efforts to try to swing the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump. Sources said it could trigger U.S. sanctions on Russia as soon as next week.
""The sanctions won't probably be that bad, and also as Russia has the financial means to whether the sanctions, it won't be such a big shock for the rouble,"" said Jakob Christensen, chief analyst and head of EM research at Danske Bank. ""We are cautiously optimistic on the rouble, we think rouble is set to strengthen over the coming months relative to other EM currencies,"" he said, as a hawkish central bank and oil prices should help more fundamentally.

The latest threat comes after the United States and European Union imposed sanctions, albeit limited, over the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. MSCI's index of EM currencies was down 0.1%, while the stocks counterpart slipped 0.4%, both down for the third day in four.
The dollar held steady ahead of the Fed decision due at 02:00 p.m. ET. Eyes will be on the reaction of U.S. Treasury yields. Investors will be looking for any comments on whether the Fed expects a stimulus-induced likely spurt in economic growth to cause inflation to rise enough to warrant a change in their policy stance earlier than expected, or if they would take action to control a recent sell-off in Treasuries.
The Chinese yuan inched higher, while most other Asian currencies dipped into the red. South Africa's rand led losses among the most commonly watched EM currencies, down 0.5%, while Turkey's lira gave up 0.1%, positioning itself around 7.50 ahead of a key central bank meeting on Thursday.
At Brazil's central bank meeting on Wednesday, a hike in interest rates by 50-75 basis points is expected, which would be Brazil's first hike in six years. The real is among the worst-performing EM currencies year-to-date, thanks to worries about fiscal spending, political interference, and rising inflation.

With Fed policymakers expected to forecast the fastest U.S. economic growth in decades in the wake of COVID-19 vaccinations and $1.9 trillion in new stimulus, market participants will be focused on clues that the central bank could start raising rates in 2023, earlier than it had said.
In any event, expectations of a faster-than-expected economic recovery will likely weigh.
“U.S. yields might receive further upwards thrust and pull the dollar along with them in the absence of a clear commitment on the part of the Fed that a further rise in yields is undesirable”, Commerzbank Antje Praefcke analyst wrote in a morning note.
She added that because the European Central Bank had in contrast committed to increase the pace of bond buying to keep a lid on rising yields, the euro might suffer against the dollar in the short term.
The euro was down 0.07% at $1.1893 after declining in the past three sessions.
Hurt by a possible delay in the European Union’s vaccination effort, the euro seemed set to test last week’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355.
Europe’s medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon.
Europe’s painful recovery from the pandemic is in sharp contrast with other economies which seem less dependant on monetary stimulus to pull though.
The Bank of Canada for instance is likely to reduce its bond purchases as soon as next month, strategists say.
In morning trades in Europe, the dollar index ticked up 0.09% and stood at 91.953, having already risen for three straight sessions on support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were also ticking up at 1.6340%. They had reached 1.6420% on Friday for the first time since February 2020.
Against the yen, the greenback firmed 0.15% to 109.14 yen, hovering near nine-month highs hit this week.
The British pound was up 0.14% at $1.3914 recovering from profit-taking after it hit a near three-year high last month on the back of a fast vaccine rollout.

AMSTERDAM, March 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields inched higher, following U.S. Treasuries ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s meeting later on Wednesday.
U.S. benchmark Treasury yields ticked up in early London trade, nearing recent 13-month highs as investors awaited the Fed’s latest policy decision. The Fed is in focus as expectations that vast U.S. fiscal stimulus will boost economic growth and cause inflation to rebound have pushed government bond yields higher in recent weeks.
Markets will be focusing on the Fed’s so-called “dot plot”, which shows the outlook for its policy rate. While some economists expect this will show one rate hike for 2023 versus none in December, an unchanged median dot for that year could be interpreted as Fed push-back against the recent bond market sell-off.
“With the FOMC meeting looming large as potential catalyst for the next move in Treasuries, EUR markets are unlikely to venture far with data calendars otherwise void,” ING analysts told clients, referring to the Fed.
With euro area bonds continuing to outperform Treasuries on Wednesday, analysts said the European Central Bank’s decision to accelerate its pandemic emergency bond purchases last week, and delays in the bloc’s vaccine roll-out topped by a temporary halt to AstraZeneca vaccinations were keeping bond yields subdued in the bloc.
At 0807 GMT, Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the bloc, was unchanged at -0.34%.
Italian 10-year yields were also unchanged at 0.63%, keeping the closely watched risk premium over German equivalents at 95 basis points.
Focus is also on the primary market on Wednesday, where Greece is expected to launch its first new 30-year bond since 2008 after hiring a syndicate of banks on Tuesday.
Luxembourg is also selling a new 10-year bond via a syndicate of banks, according to a lead manager memo seen by Reuters.

41,FTSE 100 set for flat start amid mixed views on likely surge in US economy as Federal Reserve ups forecasts,2021-03-17T06:45:08Z,The FTSE 100 was set for a flat start today amid expectations the US Federal Reserve is poised to upgrade forecasts for economic growth.,"T he FTSE 100 was set for a flat start today amid expectations the US Federal Reserve is poised to upgrade forecasts for economic growth.
Investors will view the US central bank’s increasing bullishness in two ways: some will say it puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates, which is bad for stock markets; others will say the Fed cannot increase rates yet, while a strong economy means higher profits for companies.
It is a two-way pull in financial markets that has been rumbling through the stock market for much of 2021, and will rear its head again when the Fed makes the expected big upgrade to its last predictions this week.
In December, it said the US would grow 4.2% this year with inflation at 1.8% and unemployment dropping to 5%. Economists polled by the Financial Times predicted far more bullish numbers would emerge this time around.
It will announced its move on interest rates, followed by a press conference tonight, and few European traders will be making big bets before that happens.
The FTSE 100 was set to open flat today at 6803.61 after a yesterday’s 0.8% rise, according to trading on the IG platform.
CMC Markets analyst David Madden pointed out that sentiment in the US cooled somewhat towards the end of US trading last night, which would spill over into the UK and EU markets.
Also today we get EU inflation data for February that is likely to remain at around 0.9%.
Oil markets will be watching closely for news on US stockpiles due out this afternoon. This data could be a big factor in the energy-heavy FTSE 100 where shares of BP and Shell have an outsized impact on the index’s move due to their vast size and weighting in the index.
Fund manager Rob Arnott writes in the Financial Times today that “value stocks” - those that appear cheap relative to their dividend prospects or assets - remain undervalued despite price rises since the autumn.
He said too few investors were looking at the years beyond the Covid crisis, when normal trading would probably resume, pointing out that FTSE 100 stocks by its forecasts should, over the next 10 years, return a total of 8% a year (with 4% on top from value stocks).

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are betting the economy can take off from the COVID-19 pandemic without generating excessive inflation, and have vowed to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and a spigot of money flowing for an extended period as they lean into a potential economic boom in a way not seen since the early 1970s.
In each of the quarterly forecasts released since June, the median GDP growth projection of Fed officials has been slightly above the median of private forecasters polled by Reuters. If that holds, it would translate into expected growth this year of more than 6.2% - the highest annual rate in 37 years.
GRAPHIC: Fed vs. private 2021 GDP outlook -
But when they issue their policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials are expected to restate what they’ve promised for months now: to keep the central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and cash flowing into the economy until Americans are back to work, trusting that inflation will remain contained, as it has been for about 30 years.
The economic projections and policy statement are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell will hold a news conference shortly after, an event that could prove tricky for the Fed chief.
Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected. Some policymakers could even hint at that if new projections show more of them anticipate a rate increase sometime in 2023, rather than a year or more later.
If a majority see a 2023 hike, “Powell will have his work cut out for him” explaining how that meshes with a promise to get the economy back to full employment before reducing the crisis support rolled out when the pandemic struck, Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors, wrote this week.
Still, investors are already betting on earlier hikes, and some economists are also raising a red flag along with their forecasts. Morgan Stanley, among the more bullish in predicting the economy will have fully escaped its pandemic hole by September, sees the Fed’s approach producing a “hotter but shorter” business cycle that is likely to prompt it to tighten monetary policy early next year.
The coming cycle would be less like the last three expansions - the one ended by the pandemic lasted a decade - and more like the period after World War Two when the intervals between recessions were shorter and intervening growth stronger.
That epoch ended when then-President Richard Nixon encouraged loose monetary policy ahead of his 1972 re-election. Arthur Burns, who was the Fed chief at the time, kept interest rates low as the economy accelerated, and is often blamed for the ensuing rampant inflation that dogged the country for a decade.
This time is different, Fed officials argue. Indeed, Powell’s legacy may hinge on whether inflation remains tame as the economy recovers, or whether prices spike, forcing the central bank to pull back its support - perhaps with millions of Americans still out of work.
Their arguments are well-rehearsed. Inflation and unemployment don’t behave as they used to; lower levels of joblessness can now coexist with low inflation.
The Fed made substantial changes to its policy statement last year encompassing that thinking, and the guidance issued in December is expected to hold for now. It pledged to continue its monthly $120 billion of bond purchases until there was “substantial further progress” towards full employment and 2% inflation. Moreover, it said interest rates would not increase until those goals were actually met.
None of those things have happened yet, a point Powell has stressed recently and will likely again on Wednesday. The economy remains about 9 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level; the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, at 1.5%, is well short of its goal; a new index of slow-moving inflation expectations is also below target.

Still, it is a pivotal moment as Fed officials issue forecasts incorporating a bounty of new information.
Since their December projections, more than 100 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States and daily deaths due to the virus have fallen by two-thirds. Optimism has spiked, and states have begun lifting restrictions on businesses and reopening schools. Washington also has approved two new relief packages worth about $2.8 trillion, money now rolling into household and business bank accounts.
Much has changed since the Burns era, when wages and inflation were tightly linked, the economy relied more on manufacturing and imported oil, and unforeseen shocks from an oil embargo were just ahead. [Related graphic: here]
The Fed’s new approach, moreover, isn’t an in-the-moment response to political pressure, but a policy shift meant to reflect changes in the economy officials spent years studying.
With an emphasis on job creation and downplaying inflation, the new framework seemed well suited for the job market crisis spawned by the pandemic. The issue now is how it meshes with an economy that may recover faster than thought possible.
Analysts at BlackRock have praised the Fed for being “clear-eyed” about the economy’s problems during the pandemic and in its response to it.

European stocks look set to follow the trend in Asia-Pacific overnight, where markets traded mixed as investors wait for the outcome of the Fed's two-day policy meeting later in the day. U.S. stock futures were flat ahead of the meeting's outcome and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
The Fed will release new economic and interest rate forecasts, which could indicate that the central bank's officials expect to raise rates by, or even before, 2023.
The Fed is expected to acknowledge stronger growth, which should put the Fed's easy policies in the spotlight, especially given the new $1.9 trillion in federal stimulus spending. Investors will also hear from Chair Powell, who is likely to rock the stock and bond markets with his commentary, despite him being unlikely to offer specifics.
The Fed's meeting comes ahead of other central bank meetings later this week, with the Bank of England and Bank of Japan also set to hold meetings on Thursday.
Oil prices too are in focus after they fell Tuesday, as traders are worried about fuel demand recovery. That came after more European countries suspended the use of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca, which implied economic recovery from the pandemic may potentially be delayed.
Experts have warned that the suspension, due to concerns over a potential link to reports of blood clots in a handful of cases of vaccinated people, could have far-reaching consequences.
The World Health Organization and European Medicines Agency are carrying out safety reviews of the vaccine, with results expected shortly, but have insisted that available data shows the vaccine is safe and that its benefit outweighs any risks, while the pandemic's impact is still acute in Europe.

What’s not for the Fed to like?

Part of the market narrative of recent weeks has been that the Fed had somehow lost control of the U.S. Treasury bond market, allowing traders to become restive due to a lack of hard guidance, fear of excessive stimulus and inflation anxiety.
As borrowing rates backed up to pre-pandemic levels - already historically low levels before COVID-19 hit - and unsettled stock markets that have lapped up the idea of emergency borrowing rates for years to come, Fed officials refused to protest the move or offer the prospect of even more support.
Fed policymakers, who are concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, may well address technical money market disturbances from the rundown of Treasury’s bank account at the U.S. central bank - something flooding banks with excess reserves and raising questions about extending relief on their resulting purchases of more Treasury securities.
But even if this factor was the root of recent bond market ructions, the Fed’s fundamental message on its new average inflation targetting regime seems to be getting through just fine.
Not only are Fed officials expecting a temporary snapback in inflation to as high as 3% over the coming year, they are positively targetting 2%-plus so their average target is met by a symmetric period above that level matching the long periods stuck below it.
That’s the whole point of the strategy rethink - allowing the economy to run hot for periods to eat up accumulated slack and joblessness from periods of sluggish or sub-par growth.
And so while inflation fears grip the headlines, bond market pricing merely apes that objective rather than threatening it.
With oil prices more than double where they were at the nadir of the first pandemic-related lockdowns last year, forecast base effects on headline inflation will be sparky and unpredictable for several months - possibly even exaggerated later in the year by bottlenecks during the re-opening of shuttered services and travel.
But expectations embedded in inflation-protected bonds and in swaps markets show the five-year view similar to one-year indications of inflation around 2.50%.
While that’s a percentage point higher than 2019 levels and the highest since just before the banking crash of 2008, it’s in the ballpark of what the Fed’s been aiming at and shows just how long expectations skulked below target for the past decade.
Crucially, 10-year and 30-year equivalent expectations subside again to about 2.20/2.25%. And 10- and 30-year nominal bond yields of 1.6% and 2.4% are hardly excessive given they have room to move higher without cries about disjointed pricing.
It seems unlikely the Fed will be unnerved by a wobble in a stock market that is still near record highs and where worries about bubbles and one-way pricing were the bigger investor and policymaker fears only a month ago.
GRAPHIC: Tolerated Inflation Hump? -

FED IN CONTROL?
Where there is a challenge to Fed communication is market pricing for an interest rate hike at the tail end of next year - an aggressive take that flies in the face of the central bank’s signals that no move is likely on interest rates until 2023.
Were the Fed to push back hard on that, perhaps relatively benign inflation thinking may go up a notch too.
Beyond this week’s policy meeting, a wider worry is that what’s good for the Fed may not be for the rest of the world and the latter comes back to haunt Washington anyhow.
That’s partly a result of the still dominant role of the dollar and U.S. Treasury market in world finance - something Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet Yellen has previously said influenced Fed thinking in the past.
Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen thinks that should throw down the gauntlet to global fiscal authorities to mirror the ambition of President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion spending package, which was enacted last week.
“For now, Biden and the Fed can sit back a bit and enjoy the spectacle of a much faster U.S. recovery, while the world of foreign governments, central banks and markets try to figure out how to react to this new and bold U.S. policy approach.”
But angst about loose policy settings and markets fighting the Fed remain largely a discussion of risk than a reality of pricing.

LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Far from fighting the Federal Reserve, bond markets have in many ways been remarkably well behaved and are acting right on cue. What’s not for the Fed to like?
Part of the market narrative of recent weeks has been that the Fed had somehow lost control of the U.S. Treasury bond market, allowing traders to become restive due to a lack of hard guidance, fear of excessive stimulus and inflation anxiety.
As borrowing rates backed up to pre-pandemic levels - already historically low levels before COVID-19 hit - and unsettled stock markets that have lapped up the idea of emergency borrowing rates for years to come, Fed officials refused to protest the move or offer the prospect of even more support.
Fed policymakers, who are concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, may well address technical money market disturbances from the rundown of Treasury’s bank account at the U.S. central bank - something flooding banks with excess reserves and raising questions about extending relief on their resulting purchases of more Treasury securities.
But even if this factor was the root of recent bond market ructions, the Fed’s fundamental message on its new average inflation targetting regime seems to be getting through just fine.
Not only are Fed officials expecting a temporary snapback in inflation to as high as 3% over the coming year, they are positively targetting 2%-plus so their average target is met by a symmetric period above that level matching the long periods stuck below it.
That’s the whole point of the strategy rethink - allowing the economy to run hot for periods to eat up accumulated slack and joblessness from periods of sluggish or sub-par growth.
And so while inflation fears grip the headlines, bond market pricing merely apes that objective rather than threatening it.
With oil prices more than double where they were at the nadir of the first pandemic-related lockdowns last year, forecast base effects on headline inflation will be sparky and unpredictable for several months - possibly even exaggerated later in the year by bottlenecks during the re-opening of shuttered services and travel.
But expectations embedded in inflation-protected bonds and in swaps markets show the five-year view similar to one-year indications of inflation around 2.50%.
While that’s a percentage point higher than 2019 levels and the highest since just before the banking crash of 2008, it’s in the ballpark of what the Fed’s been aiming at and shows just how long expectations skulked below target for the past decade.
Crucially, 10-year and 30-year equivalent expectations subside again to about 2.20/2.25%. And 10- and 30-year nominal bond yields of 1.6% and 2.4% are hardly excessive given they have room to move higher without cries about disjointed pricing.
It seems unlikely the Fed will be unnerved by a wobble in a stock market that is still near record highs and where worries about bubbles and one-way pricing were the bigger investor and policymaker fears only a month ago.
FED IN CONTROL?
Where there is a challenge to Fed communication is market pricing for an interest rate hike at the tail end of next year - an aggressive take that flies in the face of the central bank’s signals that no move is likely on interest rates until 2023.
Were the Fed to push back hard on that, perhaps relatively benign inflation thinking may go up a notch too.
Beyond this week’s policy meeting, a wider worry is that what’s good for the Fed may not be for the rest of the world and the latter comes back to haunt Washington anyhow.
That’s partly a result of the still dominant role of the dollar and U.S. Treasury market in world finance - something Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet Yellen has previously said influenced Fed thinking in the past.
Unicredit chief economist Erik Nielsen thinks that should throw down the gauntlet to global fiscal authorities to mirror the ambition of President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion spending package, which was enacted last week.
“For now, Biden and the Fed can sit back a bit and enjoy the spectacle of a much faster U.S. recovery, while the world of foreign governments, central banks and markets try to figure out how to react to this new and bold U.S. policy approach.”
But angst about loose policy settings and markets fighting the Fed remain largely a discussion of risk than a reality of pricing.

49,WRAPUP 1-Back to the '70s as Fed fuels boom and hopes for no Burns marks,2021-03-17T06:00:00Z,"Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with GDP growth likely to be a blow-out number that sets the stage for an historic experiment by U.S. central bank policymakers.","* Investors focused on new Fed economic projections
* Policy statement, forecasts due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT)
* Fed chief Powell to hold news briefing
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials are due to issue new economic projections on Wednesday, with GDP growth likely to be a blow-out number that sets the stage for an historic experiment by U.S. central bank policymakers.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are betting the economy can take off from the COVID-19 pandemic without generating excessive inflation, and have vowed to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and a spigot of money flowing for an extended period as they lean into a potential economic boom in a way not seen since the early 1970s.
In each of the quarterly forecasts released since June, the median GDP growth projection of Fed officials has been slightly above the median of private forecasters polled by Reuters. If that holds, it would translate into expected growth this year of more than 6.2% - the highest annual rate in 37 years.
But when they issue their policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, Fed officials are expected to restate what they’ve promised for months now: to keep the central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and cash flowing into the economy until Americans are back to work, trusting that inflation will remain contained, as it has been for about 30 years.
The economic projections and policy statement are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell will hold a news conference shortly after, an event that could prove tricky for the Fed chief.
Markets predict the Fed may be forced to act sooner than expected. Some policymakers could even hint at that if new projections show more of them anticipate a rate increase sometime in 2023, rather than a year or more later.
If a majority see a 2023 hike, “Powell will have his work cut out for him” explaining how that meshes with a promise to get the economy back to full employment before reducing the crisis support rolled out when the pandemic struck, Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist for SGH Macro Advisors, wrote this week.
Still, investors are already betting on earlier hikes, and some economists are also raising a red flag along with their forecasts. Morgan Stanley, among the more bullish in predicting the economy will have fully escaped its pandemic hole by September, sees the Fed’s approach producing a “hotter but shorter” business cycle that is likely to prompt it to tighten monetary policy early next year.
The coming cycle would be less like the last three expansions - the one ended by the pandemic lasted a decade - and more like the period after World War Two when the intervals between recessions were shorter and intervening growth stronger.
That epoch ended when then-President Richard Nixon encouraged loose monetary policy ahead of his 1972 re-election. Arthur Burns, who was the Fed chief at the time, kept interest rates low as the economy accelerated, and is often blamed for the ensuing rampant inflation that dogged the country for a decade.
This time is different, Fed officials argue. Indeed, Powell’s legacy may hinge on whether inflation remains tame as the economy recovers, or whether prices spike, forcing the central bank to pull back its support - perhaps with millions of Americans still out of work.
Their arguments are well-rehearsed. Inflation and unemployment don’t behave as they used to; lower levels of joblessness can now coexist with low inflation.
The Fed made substantial changes to its policy statement last year encompassing that thinking, and the guidance issued in December is expected to hold for now. It pledged to continue its monthly $120 billion of bond purchases until there was “substantial further progress” towards full employment and 2% inflation. Moreover, it said interest rates would not increase until those goals were actually met.
None of those things have happened yet, a point Powell has stressed recently and will likely again on Wednesday. The economy remains about 9 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level; the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, at 1.5%, is well short of its goal; a new index of slow-moving inflation expectations is also below target.
‘CLEAR-EYED’
Still, it is a pivotal moment as Fed officials issue forecasts incorporating a bounty of new information.
Since their December projections, more than 100 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States and daily deaths due to the virus have fallen by two-thirds. Optimism has spiked, and states have begun lifting restrictions on businesses and reopening schools. Washington also has approved two new relief packages worth about $2.8 trillion, money now rolling into household and business bank accounts.
Much has changed since the Burns era, when wages and inflation were tightly linked, the economy relied more on manufacturing and imported oil, and unforeseen shocks from an oil embargo were just ahead. [Related graphic: here ]
The Fed’s new approach, moreover, isn’t an in-the-moment response to political pressure, but a policy shift meant to reflect changes in the economy officials spent years studying.
With an emphasis on job creation and downplaying inflation, the new framework seemed well suited for the job market crisis spawned by the pandemic. The issue now is how it meshes with an economy that may recover faster than thought possible.
Analysts at BlackRock have praised the Fed for being “clear-eyed” about the economy’s problems during the pandemic and in its response to it.
But, wrote Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, “at some point, the financial stability risks that emanate from an extremely low policy rate, coupled with the real economy boom that we expect, could in fact force the Fed’s hand.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/wrapup-1-back-to-the-70s-as-fed-fuels-boom-and-hopes-for-no-burns-marks-idUSL1N2LE1D0

53,Fed needs to keep a cool head around bond market,2021-03-17T04:58:42Z,Westpac chief economist Bill Evans is hoping that the US Federal Reserve will telegraph calm over rising bond yields after its two-day policy meeting which concludes early Thursday morning AEDT.,"The Federal Reserve, instead of acting on the message bond markets are sending about the potential for rising inflation, has talked at length about how important it is to reach full employment before trying to normalise monetary policy.
And Mr Evans believes the Fed will continue to hold firm against raising interest rates. “We’ll see tonight whether we get a rush of dots but I suspect that won’t be the case,” he said. The “dots” is a reference to a dot plot chart where Fed members anonymously signal their view on the future level of interest rates.
When the Fed eventually decides to start to normalise policy, then that could be start of a global tightening phase, Mr Evans believes. “The Fed is going to be leading this cycle,” he said.
The RBA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will likely wait for the Fed to adjust policy before doing so themselves, he added. The Reserve Bank of Australia earlier this year nailed interest rates to 0.1 per cent until 2024.
If the RBA or the RBNZ move before the Fed, then the Australian and New Zealand dollars would likely shoot up, as would bond yields. “I suspect that the Reserve Bank of Australia would feel very uncomfortable raising rates before the Fed,” the economist said.
And the RBA is likely to be the slowest of the three when it comes to policy tightening, said Mr Evans.

“Given the clear patience from the Reserve Bank and, I believe, the very, very clear urgency to restore their credibility in this particular cycle, I would be betting that the Reserve Bank would be behind the Reserve Bank of New Zealand when it comes to raising rates,” the economist said.
Mr Evans admitted to being “a bit perplexed” by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand: “They told the banks to get ready for negative interest rates and now of course we are getting indications that they are looking at raising rates,” he said.
But the economist suspects the RBNZ is a long way from actually following through. “I think that they will use the macroprudential route to try and deal with the housing market rather than raising rates and risking what that might do to their currency and the rest of the economy,” he said.
The newly-defiant stance of the Fed and other central banks against the bond market shows there’s a radical shift underway in central bank thinking in the post-pandemic world.
“The sort of phraseology - or the concept that has driven markets in previous cycles - that the central bank doesn’t want to get behind the curve and therefore needs to be pre-emptive, I don’t think that’s going to be a factor in central bank thinking this cycle,” he said.
Central banks have had too many periods of missing their wage and inflation forecasts and moving too soon and being preemptive to make hasty moves this time, he said. “That the signal from the bond market - that they need to be preemptive - will be stared through.”",https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/fed-needs-to-keep-a-cool-head-around-bond-market-20210317-p57bef

With the U.S. economy picking up steam, investors will be watching for any indications that the Fed could start raising rates earlier than it has previously indicated, which could support a stronger greenback. Traders said the outcome could prompt more market volatility, though the likelihood of a clear policy shift is low. ""The yuan is probably going to be directionless today.

The offshore yuan was 10 pips weaker than the previous day's close at 6.5031 per dollar. Analysts continue to expect the yuan to appreciate this year, though at a slower pace than 2020, when it appreciated 6.7%. Authorities have stepped up efforts to contain the yuan's rise, with the central bank purchasing its most foreign exchange in more than five years in February. Sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that at least one major state-owned bank is conducting large currency swaps in the mainland China market, possibly as part of efforts to rein in the yuan. Rising tensions between Beijing and Washington could also put a damper on the currency's rise.

60,Fed projects patience even as economic outlook brightens,2021-03-17T04:00:00Z,The Federal Reserve's latest projections show the central bank’s policy interest rate on hold at near-zero for years to come even as growth is expected to pick up considerably in the near term.,"The Fed slashed its policy interest rate — which guides borrowing costs throughout the economy — to rock bottom in March 2020 and chose to keep it there Wednesday, an effort to keep credit cheap and continue stoking growth. Analysts had expected the steady outcome but were closely watching the central bank’s fresh set of economic projections, which show officials’ anonymous estimates of how conditions will evolve through 2023 and in the longer run.
Federal Reserve officials signaled Wednesday that they are in no rush to dial back support for a US economy still struggling amid the pandemic, releasing a fresh set of projections that showed the central bank’s policy interest rate on hold at near-zero for years to come even as growth is expected to pick up considerably in the near term.
Advertisement
The new release showed that officials have become more optimistic about the outlook for growth, unemployment, and inflation since their December estimates came out — but not to the point that they anticipate a wild overheating of the economy or expect to remove policy support rapidly. Most officials still see rates at rock-bottom over the next three years, meaning they are not penciling in a rate increase until at least 2024.
“No one should be complacent,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon, noting that “the path ahead remains uncertain” and highly dependent on the virus.
Fed officials, in their post-meeting statement, noted that some parts of the economy had improved and Powell noted that participants pointed to vaccines and fiscal stimulus in revising up their economic expectations. But he noted that the unemployment rate remains elevated, and that millions of jobs are still missing.
Since the Fed last updated its economic projections, Congress and the White House have passed two large spending packages — a $900 billion bill in December and another $1.9 trillion earlier this month. That huge infusion of government cash will put money in consumer bank accounts and could help to avert economic damage that Fed officials had worried about, like bankruptcies and evictions.

Powell his colleagues have been clear that they want to see a job market that is back at full employment and inflation that is slightly above 2 percent and expected to stay there for some time before lifting interest rates.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/03/17/business/fed-projects-patience-even-economic-outlook-brightens/
61,"Federal Reserve Looking Ahead To Higher Inflation As Economy Rebounds, But It Won’t Raise Rates Yet",2021-03-17T04:00:00Z,The central bank expects GDP growth of 6.5% this year.,"Topline
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged that the economic outlook is improving in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, which it expects will raise inflation over 2%, but signaled that it will keep rates at near-zero levels through 2023.

Key Facts
The leaders of the central bank predict that the unemployment rate (which now sits at 6.2%, down from an eye-watering high of 14.7% in April) will fall to 4.5% by the end of 2021. They expect GDP to grow 6.5% this year, up from their prediction of 4.2% growth three months ago, and core inflation to come in at 2.2% for the year (though it’s currently running at below 2%, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee said, and is likely to slow to 2.0% in 2022). Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that the central bank will not move to raise rates until it sees significant evidence that the economy is on the road to a robust recovery, which the central bank defines as maximum employment and inflation that averages 2%. Powell emphasized Wednesday that short term spikes in prices and wages might occur in the second half of the year as vaccinations pick up and stimulus spending makes its way into the economy, but signaled that the Fed does not see those short term spikes as cause for immediate concern. The Fed will also keep purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $120 billion per month as part of a program to prop up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus crisis.
Key Background
Trillions of dollars in “swift and forceful” federal stimulus spending in the United States helped avert “some of the very worst economic outcomes,” Powell said during a press briefing Wednesday. That spending has also fueled concern on Wall Street about ballooning levels of debt and runaway inflation.
Big Number
37%. That’s the portion of fund managers who named inflation as the number one risk to markets, according to a Bank of America survey released Tuesday. It’s the first time in more than a year that the risk of Covid-19 was not the top concern for global investment managers.
Tangent
In August, the Federal Reserve made a major change to its strategy for managing inflation. Rather than pulling back on policy and raising rates to head off inflation before it reaches 2%, the Fed will now seek to maintain inflation that averages 2% over time. That means that the central bank is now prepared to tolerate periods of inflation above 2% during economic downturns—a change designed to prevent it from slowing down an economic recovery by withdrawing support too early.
Crucial Quote
“While we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent,” Powell said Wednesday. “At the Fed, we will continue to provide the economy the support it needs for as long as it takes.”

The decision, which came on a volatile day for investors with Treasury yields surging ahead of the announcement, masked a growing number of officials who saw liftoff before then, though Chair Jerome Powell stressed this was a minority view.
(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials continued to project near-zero interest rates at least through 2023 despite upgrading their US economic outlook and the mounting inflation worries in financial markets.

Seven of 18 officials predicted higher rates by the end of 2023 compared with five of 17 at the December meeting, showing a slightly larger group who see an earlier start than peers to the withdrawal of ultra-easy monetary policy, according to the Federal Open Market Committee quarterly economic projections issued alongside its policy statement.
“Indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak,” the FOMC said in its statement. “Inflation continues to run below 2 percent.”

The Fed expects that a bump in inflation this year will be short-lived. Officials saw their preferred measure of price pressures slowing to 2 percent next year following a spike to 2.4 percent in 2021, according to the projections. Excluding food and energy, inflation is forecast to hit 2.2 percent this year and fall to 2 percent in 2022.
Ten-year Treasury yields remained near one-year highs after the statement with stocks reversing losses.
Asked about the move in yields, Powell noted that it was “important conditions continue to remain accommodative” and that he would be concerned by “disorderly markets,” repeating a line he used earlier this month.

Massive fiscal support and widening vaccinations that will help reopen the economy have buoyed investor expectations for rate increases and inflation, propelling Treasury yields higher as the Fed and federal government keep adding stimulus.
Wednesday’s decision was unanimous.
Asset Purchases
US central bankers left asset purchases unchanged at $120 billion a month and repeated that this pace would be maintained until “substantial further progress” is made on their employment and inflation goals.
The target range of the benchmark federal funds rate was also kept at zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since last March.
Powell and his colleagues met as the economy continues to improve. Job gains picked up last month and President Joe Biden signed an additional $1.9 trillion of pandemic aid into law on March 11. Vaccinations continue apace, allowing states to start easing lockdown restrictions that could release a torrent of consumer spending.
The economy remains far from the Fed’s goals, though. Even with 379,000 jobs added to payrolls in February, 9.5 million fewer Americans have jobs compared with a year ago and inflation remains well below the Fed’s 2 percent target.
“This particular downturn was a direct hit on the part of the economy that employs many minorities,” Powell said.
Still, prospects for stronger growth have ignited some concern about higher inflation, contributing to a rise in 10-year Treasury yields in recent weeks. Powell told lawmakers in testimony last month that the economy is still has a long way to go before there’s any risk of overheating.

They also upgraded forecasts for economic growth and the labor market, with the median estimate for unemployment falling to 4.5 percent at the end of 2021 and 3.5 percent in 2023, while gross domestic product was seen expanding 6.5 percent this year, up from a prior projection of 4.2 percent.
Christopher Waller, who joined the Board of Governors in late December, contributed projections for the first time this month.

The Nikkei 225 Index edged up 0.16% to 29,968.06 by 0215 GMT, while the broader Topix rose 0.03% to 1,982.11.
Sentiment for Japanese equities remained fairly positive due to a healthy outlook for the global economy and progress in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, analysts said.
Japanese stocks are, however, likely to move in a narrow range for the remainder of the month as investors retreat to the sidelines with the fiscal year ending on March 31.
The focus shifts to a Fed meeting ending later in the day, where some U.S. policymakers may bring forward their expectations for rate hikes due to an improving economy.
Investors also keenly await the outcome of a BOJ meeting that is expected to end later in the week. Japan’s central bank could abandon a numerical target for exchange-traded fund (ETFs) purchases, but analysts say the stock market is strong enough to continue rising if that did happen.
“If there is any disappointment in reaction to the BOJ, it won’t last long,” said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.
“Japanese stocks have proven that they don’t need the BOJ to buy ETFs to rise sharply. Once we reach April a lot of new money will enter the stock market.”

The dollar index stood at 91.866, having risen for the last three sessions, drawing support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields on the back of expectations of a strong economic recovery.
Fed policymakers are expected to give a nod to such a rosy view, by forecasting that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, as the COVID-19 vaccination campaign gathers pace and a $1.9 trillion relief package washes through to households.
A bigger question for market players is whether the Fed will signal any inclination to start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than it has previously said, in a move that could fuel a further rally in the dollar.
“The Fed will likely revise up its economic forecast. But for its median forecast on the Fed funds rate in 2023 to be raised, four or more members have to raise their projections. So the market’s expectations of earlier rate hikes may not be validated by the Fed,” said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at Barclays.
“But on the other hand, the Fed is likely to sit idle on rising long-term rates as well. All considered, it is hard to expect the dollar/yen to weaken after the FOMC, though it could face more headwinds if it tests new highs.”
The dollar stood at 109.01 yen, not far from Monday’s nine-month high of 109.365.
The euro changed hands at $1.1903, having declined over the last three days, with immediate supports at its 200-day moving average of $1.1843 and last week’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355.

The dollar index stood at 91.866, having risen for the last three sessions, drawing support mainly from elevated U.S. bond yields on the back of expectations of a strong economic recovery. Fed policymakers are expected to give a nod to such a rosy view, by forecasting that the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, as the COVID-19 vaccination campaign gathers pace and a $1.9 trillion relief package washes through to households.

A bigger question for market players is whether the Fed will signal any inclination to start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than it has previously said, in a move that could fuel a further rally in the dollar. ""The Fed will likely revise up its economic forecast. But for its median forecast on the Fed funds rate in 2023 to be raised, four or more members have to raise their projections. So the market's expectations of earlier rate hikes may not be validated by the Fed,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at Barclays.
""But on the other hand, the Fed is likely to sit idle on rising long-term rates as well. All considered, it is hard to expect the dollar/yen to weaken after the FOMC, though it could face more headwinds if it tests new highs."" The dollar stood at 109.01 yen, not far from Monday's nine-month high of 109.365.
The euro changed hands at $1.1903, having declined over the last three days, with immediate supports at its 200-day moving average of $1.1843 and last week's 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355. But a possible delay in vaccinations could weigh on the common currency as Sweden and Latvia joined countries suspending their use in a further blow to Europe's vaccination rollout.
Europe's medicines watchdog will release results of its investigation into incidents of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in recipients of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine on Thursday afternoon. ""Depending on the outcome, it could hurt the euro zone's business sentiment further and the euro could face fresh selling pressure on the low vaccination theme,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.
Among major currencies, the U.S. dollar and the British pound have been bolstered by the faster pace of vaccine rollouts in the United States and Britain. Investors were so focused on an economic upturn due to vaccination that surprisingly weak U.S. economic data published on Tuesday, including retail sales and industrial out, hardly dented the mood.

70,"Australia, NZ dlrs tread water ahead of Fed meeting",2021-03-17T01:00:09Z,The Australian and New Zealand dollars were steady on Wednesday with currencies generally treading water ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting where policymakers are expected to reiterate their dovish policy stance despite rosier economic projections.,"SYDNEY, March 17 (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealand dollars were steady on Wednesday with currencies generally treading water ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting where policymakers are expected to reiterate their dovish policy stance despite rosier economic projections.
The Australian dollar was flat at $0.7746, drifting away from a recent one-week high of $0.7801 around which lies critical chart resistant. Key support for the Aussie is seen around $0.7710.
The New Zealand dollar was mostly unchanged at $0.7193. It sees strong support at $0.7100 while facing resistance at $0.7200 and $0.7267.
Economists expect the Fed to forecast the U.S. economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, with unemployment falling and inflation rising, as the COVID-19 vaccination campaign gathers pace and a $1.9 trillion relief package washes through to households.
Financial markets are pricing in three interest rate hikes through end-2023 so all eyes would be on the Fed’s ‘dot plots’ which signals the outlook for rates.
The Fed has kept interest rates pinned near zero for the past year, and has promised to keep them there until the economy reaches full employment, and inflation has hit 2% and is on track to exceed that pace for some time.
“Another factor to watch is Chair Jerome Powell’s push back on long-end bond yields,” said Chris Weston, Melbourne-based strategist at Pepperstone.
“Could we be entering a realm where the Fed allows market forces more independence?”
Global bond yields surged late last month on optimism about a faster-than-expected economic recovery world over and bets major central banks would soon step back from their dovish positions.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week dismissed rate hike talks while recommitting to its three-year yield curve control target at 0.1%. On Tuesday, minutes of its March 2 meeting showed policymakers were not expecting inflation and wage growth to rise material before 2024 at the earliest.
On Wednesday, Assistant Governor Chris Kent reiterated the RBA’s lower-for-longer rate view while signalling monetary policy will not be used to control asset price gains.
New Zealand government bonds rose, sending yields about 3-4 basis points lower at the long-end of the curve.
Australian government bond futures declined, with the three-year bond contract off 1 tick at 99.735. The 10-year contract slipped 3 ticks to 98.24. (Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-forex/australia-nz-dlrs-tread-water-ahead-of-fed-meeting-idUSL1N2LF01W
