Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gold prices slid to their weakest level since mid-October on Wednesday, as investors feared the Federal Reserve might signal a faster-than-expected tapering of its pandemic-era stimulus measures at the end of its policy meeting.
Spot gold was down 1.5% at $1,760.99 per ounce by 11:22 a.m. EDT (1522 GMT), after touching its lowest since Oct. 13 at $1,757.63 earlier. U.S. gold futures fell 1.6% to $1,761.60.
The Fed is expected to announce the tapering of its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase program in its policy statement at 1800 GMT.
“We may be seeing some pre-FOMC positioning, the fear being that policymakers will be more hawkish than markets anticipate,” OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said.
Another bearish signal for gold was data showing U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, suggesting the labor market and overall economy were regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
Upbeat payrolls data could mean a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday, and that could lend weight to the case for a faster hike in interest rates, said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.
“While interest rate policy is probably number one in everybody’s minds, a very, very close second are the inflationary pressures that we have in the market at the moment,” said Meger.
Ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has helped drive gold sharply higher since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, with low interest rates cutting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inflation fears stoking demand for a hedge.
Market participants are also eyeing a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday after recent data bolstered chances for a rate hike.

Currencies
The US Treasury announced the first reduction in its quarterly sale of longer-term debt in more than five years on Wednesday, reflecting diminishing borrowing needs as the wave of pandemic-relief spending ebbs.
The Treasury Department said in a statement that it will sell $US120 billion of long-term securities at auctions next week. That’s down some $US6 billion from the record levels seen over the past three so-called quarterly refundings.
Further scaling back will be done in regular auctions of all longer-term securities in coming months, with the sole exception of inflation-linked debt. The deepest cutbacks will be in 7- and 20-year Treasuries, which had seen bigger increases in issuance during the ramping up of debt sales to meet Covid-19 needs.

“Based on the latest fiscal outlook, current auction sizes are projected to provide excess borrowing capacity over the intermediate term,” the Treasury said in its statement. After “modest reductions” over the three months through January, “any additional issuance-size changes will be announced quarterly in subsequent refunding statements”, the department said.

Jollibee Foods Corp., the biggest fast-food chain, gained 2.6 percent at P238, but grocery chain AllDay Marts Inc. of the Villar Group fell 17.8 percent to P0.74 on profit taking. The rest of Asian markets rose Thursday to track another record on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve said it would be patient in hiking interest rates as the economy continues to recover. The announcement brought to an end months of speculation about the bank’s plan for the bond-buying program, and removed some unease among traders who were concerned that officials were leaving it too late to respond to rocketing inflation. And the upbeat mood filtered through to Asia, with Tokyo up almost one percent as it reopened after a one-day break, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta also rallied. The Fed is the latest bank to move away from its emergency measures and it comes after rate hikes in several countries including Canada and South Korea, while the Bank of England is expected to follow suit later in the day. It also makes the Fed the latest monetary authority to begin winding back the measures put in place at the start of the pandemic which have been crucial to the global rebound and an 18-month equity rally to multi-year or record highs.Policymakers had said at the outset that they would only start tapering when they were satisfied the world’s number one economy was well on the recovery track with unemployment under control and inflation running hot for an extended period. Inflation has been surging for months, while jobs creation continues to scorch along, albeit with the rare blip—reinforced by data Wednesday showing private businesses hired far more people than expected in October. However, while bank boss Jerome Powell was pleased with the economic recovery, he said he wanted to see the labor market heal more before hiking interest rates from record lows, telling reporters: “We think we can be patient.” The expectation is still for borrowing costs to rise in the middle of next year, soon after the bond-buying has come to an end. “I don’t think we are behind the curve. I believe policy is well-positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes,” Powell said. Still, the bank must tread a careful path as it contends with global supply chain snarls, rising commodity prices, surging wage costs and rocketing demand, all against the ever-present backdrop of the COVID pandemic.

Fed officials are trying to maintain a difficult balancing act by giving the economy as much time as possible to recover while tightening policy soon enough to contain inflation. 'PATIENCE'
""Fed Chairman Jay Powell, who is seeking renomination for another four-year term, will likely renew his calls for patience before hiking interest rates,"" argued Thomas Costerg, senior economist at Pictet wealth.

6,Federal Reserve expected to take first steps in paring back easy money policies,2021-11-03T14:05:03Z,Markets and Fed watchers are widely expecting the central bank to announce a plan to scale back its $120 billion-a-month pace of asset purchases.,"The nation's economic steward, the Federal Reserve, is expected to turn the corner on its COVID-era policies on Wednesday afternoon.
Markets and Fed watchers are widely expecting the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to announce a plan to scale back its $120 billion-a-month pace of asset purchases. Under the so-called ""quantitative easing"" program, the central bank has been directly buying U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to signal its support of the economy.
One reason for the slowdown: concerns over rising inflation. Tapering would allow the Fed to position itself to, at some later date, raise interest rates to quell rising price pressures.
Still, Fed officials have emphasized the need to close the jobs shortfall of 5 million workers (compared to pre-pandemic levels), policymakers have insisted that near-zero interest rates should still support employment as it tapers.
“I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates,” said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Oct. 22.
In his press conference, Powell could field questions about whether or not the Fed's tapering plans are connected to future interest rate hikes. But Powell will also likely face questions regarding the central bank's ongoing trading scandal, as well as Powell's own updates on whether or not he's in consideration for another term as Fed chairman.
The FOMC is slated to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

* Fed policy statement due at 1800 GMT
* Gold hits lowest level since Oct 20
Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gold prices tumbled 1% to touch a two-week low on Wednesday, ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision that investors fear will result in a faster-than-expected tapering of the central bank’s pandemic stimulus measures.
Spot gold fell 1.1% to $1,766.91 per ounce by 9:48 a.m. ET (1348 GMT). U.S. gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,769.60 per ounce.
“We may be seeing some pre-FOMC positioning, the fear being that policymakers will be more hawkish than markets anticipate,” OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said.
“Fed Chair Jerome Powell will continue to emphasize the view that inflation will correct itself but hang around for a little longer than previously anticipated. He may accept that this may warrant some rate hikes next year if it doesn’t ease up but that the view remains its transitory.”
The Fed policy announcement is due at 1800 GMT. The central bank is likely to begin paring its monthly asset purchases by $15 billion each month, bringing them to an end by mid-2022.
“The crucial question will be: How much will they reduce the monthly bond purchases?” said Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter Fertig.
Ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has helped drive gold sharply higher since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, with low interest rates cutting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inflation fears stoking demand for a hedge.
Market participants are also eyeing a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday after data suggested unemployment is unlikely to rise sharply, bolstering the case for a rate hike.
On the macro front, U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, suggesting the labor market and overall economy were regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.

8,"With bond-buying ‘taper’ in the bag, U.S. Federal Reserve turns a wary eye to inflation",2021-11-03T13:40:10Z,The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policy-makers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it,"The U.S. Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on Aug. 22, 2018.Chris Wattie/Reuters
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to detail plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases by mid-2022 as policy-makers shift their focus towards what, if anything, to do about a surge in inflation that is lasting longer than anticipated.
U.S. central bankers, in the minutes of their Sept. 21-22 meeting, signalled that a “taper” of the $120-billion in monthly asset purchases would be approved at this week’s gathering of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
What the minutes described as an “illustrative tapering path” would trim the purchases by $15-billion per month beginning in November or December, a pace and starting point that would end the program by June or July.
Of more note now is how the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement, and particularly its description of inflation as “largely reflecting transitory factors.”
Fed officials still largely hold that view. By some time in 2022 they anticipate that global supply bottlenecks will have eased, pandemic-fueled demand for goods among U.S. consumers will cool after massive spending on cars, motorcycles and appliances, and enough people will be pushing to return to jobs that the pace of wage and benefit increases will also subside.
But in recent weeks Fed officials have acknowledged the risks to that outlook. The jump in inflation this year has already lasted longer than anticipated; headline rates are running at twice the Fed’s 2 per cent target; and rising rents, low business inventories, and large numbers of workers still waiting on the sidelines may mean the high pace of price increases will continue for now.
The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policy-makers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it. Investors are acting as if the Fed’s patience will run out soon.
The Fed cut its overnight benchmark federal funds interest rate to the near-zero level last year in a bid to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. Trading in federal funds futures currently show investors expecting up to three quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2022; Fed officials as of September were split over whether there would even be one.
“Will they hold on to the transitory description of inflation? My best guess is they will,” in order to keep their commitment to support the economic recovery until the economy is closer to full employment, said Aneta Markowska, an economist at Jefferies. “If they were being intellectually honest they would probably drop it, but given what is happening in the market the Fed has to tread carefully.”
Push back too hard on the current market expectations, by emphasizing the 5 million U.S. jobs still missing from before the pandemic, and it could “unhinge” the market outlook for inflation, she noted. Lean too hard on inflation risks, and it could push rate hike expectations even higher, begin to restrict credit and borrowing, and slow the recovery.
EYES ON POWELL
The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). It will not issue new economic forecasts, so beyond the statement it will be up to Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his news conference half an hour later to strike a balance between the two sides of the central bank’s mandated goals of achieving maximum employment and stable prices.
This will be a critical communications moment for Powell whose term as Fed chief ends in February 2022. The White House has yet to announce whether the former investment banker will be reappointed to a second term.
Through much of the pandemic, Powell’s bias – and that of most other Fed policy-makers – has been in favour of the job market, in line with the central bank’s new strategic approach to allow more risks with higher inflation in order to push job growth as high as possible.
The Fed currently says it will not raise rates until inflation has not just risen to its 2 per cent target, but is on track to exceed it “for some time,” so that the 2 per cent level is maintained on average following years in which it ran low.
That phrase has not been quantified in terms of how much or how long an overshoot of inflation is intended. While Fed policy-makers have generally described achievement of the inflation benchmark as still “a ways off,” a few have noted that the averages are creeping higher already.
The labour market rebound has also taken on a different course than Fed officials expected. Despite near-record numbers of job openings, labour force participation is improving only slowly – with workers by choice or family necessity taking more time to return to jobs, and using savings elevated by pandemic benefit payments to cover the bills in the meantime.
The employment-to-population ratio is still 2.4 percentage points below where it was at the outset of the pandemic in February 2020, less than half the ground needed to be covered to return to the previous level.
The discussion over the taper of the Fed’s purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will likely end on Wednesday with the central bank declaring that the economy has made “substantial further progress” in healing from the pandemic.
The debate will then turn to how much more the job market can improve, how fast it can be done, and whether COVID-19 has changed the economy in ways that mean higher inflation with fewer people working.
“If the Fed projects that inflation will not revert to target within a reasonable amount of time, then the Fed could step up the tightening schedule even if employment is short of the mandate,” Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, wrote ahead of the policy decision. “The Fed could tell this story after this week’s meeting. In practice, the Fed has made pretty clear it is waiting for more inflation data” to see if the “transitory” narrative holds.

Investors in recent weeks increased bets that inflation will force the U.S. central bank to increase interest rates sooner rather than later, and Fed officials increasingly have acknowledged those risks.
The economic environment, however, is also fluid as central banks around the world plot their exits from loose pandemic-era policies. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, however, said on Wednesday the ECB was ""very unlikely"" here to raise rates in 2022 despite high inflation - undercutting market bets it might lift borrowing costs as soon as October.
Lagarde’s comments may have eased some of the pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Yields on 2-year U.S. Treasuries fell, and trading in federal funds futures, according to the CME Group, shifted to reflect expectations the Fed would only raise rates twice next year instead of three times as was expected earlier this week.
The announcement of a bond-buying “taper” may be the central policy step taken by the Fed on Wednesday. U.S. central bankers, in the minutes of their Sept. 21-22 meeting, signaled they would in November or December begin reducing their current $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by $15 billion per month, ending the program altogether in June or July.
(For graphic on Fed balance sheet by era - )
Of more note now is whether the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement to take more account of inflation risks, and particularly whether it alters the description of inflation as “largely reflecting transitory factors.”
Fed officials still largely hold the view that through 2022 global supply bottlenecks will ease, pandemic-fueled demand for goods among U.S. consumers will cool, and enough people will want to return to jobs that wage and benefit increases will also subside.
But a jump in inflation this year has already lasted longer than anticipated; headline rates are twice the Fed’s 2% target; and rising rents, low business inventories, and large numbers of workers on the sidelines may mean the high pace of price increases will continue for now.
(For graphic on ""Broad-based"" or not? ""Broad-based"" or not? - )
The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policymakers feel compelled to step in with rate increases to curb it. Fed officials as of September were split over whether there would need to be a rate increase in 2022 even as markets have priced in multiple hikes.
The Fed cut its overnight benchmark federal funds interest rate to the near-zero level last year in a bid to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic.
“Will they hold on to the transitory description of inflation? My best guess is they will,” in order to keep their commitment to push the U.S. economy back to full employment, said Aneta Markowska, an economist at Jefferies. “If they were being intellectually honest they would probably drop it, but given what is happening in the market the Fed has to tread carefully.”

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped on Wednesday ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve policy announcement, as investors await clues on the U.S. central bank’s plan to taper its pandemic-induced stimulus amid signs of rising inflation.
Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,784.28 per ounce by 1141 GMT. U.S. gold futures for December delivery eased 0.2% to $1,785.50 per ounce.
“Markets are expecting the Fed will announce the start of tapering today and are also pricing in rate hikes for next year, not only from the Fed but also from the European Central Bank,” said Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter Fertig.
“There might be a little bit of hesitancy, some late doubts, on whether the FOMC will really decide on tapering,” said Fertig, adding the crucial question will be about how much they will reduce the monthly bond purchases.
The Fed policy announcement is due at 1800 GMT. The central bank is likely to begin paring its monthly asset purchases by $15 billion each month, bringing them to an end by mid-2022.
Ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has helped drive gold sharply higher since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, with low interest rates cutting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inflation fears stoking demand for a hedge.
Market participants are also eyeing a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday after data suggested unemployment is unlikely to rise sharply, bolstering the case for a rate hike.
“Gold’s choppy range trading continues ahead of the FOMC, with the wider $1770.00 to $1810.00 range continuing to contain nicely,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Prices of the metal have been wavering between slight losses and gains this week, and analysts have said the Fed decision could be the event that pushes gold out of its range-bound trade.
Elsewhere, spot silver rose 0.3% to $23.59 per ounce and platinum rose 0.6% to $1,044.02 per ounce. Palladium slipped 0.3% to $2,005.19 per ounce.

Moves were small in Asia and at the start of the European trading day in the middle of a busy week for central banks, with the Bank of England meeting on Thursday.
European Central Bank Christina Lagarde said an interest rate rise in 2022 was very unlikely because inflation was too low, sending government bond yields lower. But the euro barely budged. Against the euro, the greenback was down marginally at $1.1592, not far from the $1.1522 low reached in October and the strongest level for the dollar since July 2020.
The dollar index dipped 0.1% to 93.996 but remained close to its 2021 peak of 94.563 hits last month. Dollar/yen traded at 113.8, near a four-year high.
The Fed is expected to announce the tapering of its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase program in its policy statement at 1800 GMT. Traders are focused on clues around what that means for rate rises after a month of seismic bond market moves in anticipation of hikes as soon as next year.
Analysts are divided as to what the Fed meeting and statement will mean for the dollar, especially after the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday and ECB on Wednesday both pushed back against market pricing of tighter policy. ""The dollar bearish case today is that the tapering is widely expected and an inherently dovish Fed, concerned about upsetting the bond market, does not change its statement substantially,"" ING strategists wrote.
""Yet, at some point, the Fed is going to have to acknowledge that elevated inflation does not 'largely reflect transitory factors. Many dovish central banks around the world are already doing this and should the Fed start to show greater concern about this today, U.S. rates and the dollar could get a boost."" The RBA on Tuesday abandoned its short-term yield target and dropped its expectation of holding rates at record lows until 2024, though the Aussie fell because the bank also pushed back on aggressive pricing for 2022 hikes.
The Aussie dropped 1.2% against the dollar on Tuesday and sat at $0.744 on Wednesday, up 0.2% from the session open. The New Zealand dollar was also dragged 1% lower, but found support on Wednesday from strong labor data and hovered at $0.714, up 0.4%. Money markets have dialed back expectations for a 15 basis point hike from the Bank of England on Thursday but still expect one before 2022.
Sterling recovered from a two-week low to trade 0.2% higher at $1.3645. The euro fell again versus the Swiss franc and was last down 0.3% at 1.055 francs, close to this week's almost 18-month low of 1.0548.

13,The Federal Reserve's ethics scandal is not resolved,2021-11-03T12:00:08Z,"To restore public confidence, the Federal Reserve must move promptly to require all top Fed officials to hold their financial assets in qualified blind trusts throughout their tenure in office.","The Federal Reserve’s reputation has been severely damaged by revelations that top Fed officials routinely ignored their own code of ethical conduct and that some officials may have broken the law. While the Fed has taken some positive steps in recent weeks, this scandal is still far from being resolved.
The Fed’s newly-announced ethics rules remain grossly inadequate. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has not provided sufficient clarity about his own financial transactions. And the Fed is still not following its own rules about engaging law enforcement agencies whenever criminal statutes may have been broken.
Every federal official is strictly prohibited from using nonpublic information for personal gain, but this statute has distinctive implications for Federal Reserve officials. In particular, the Fed’s monetary policy actions have broad effects on financial markets, not just individual companies.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moreover, the Fed’s leadership often formulates its policy plans over an extensive horizon, and key aspects of those plans may remain confidential for many months. For example, in one previous Fed scandal, a Wall Street analyst sent a newsletter to clients in early October 2012 entitled “December Bound” that disclosed the Fed leadership’s plans for the December 2012 monetary policy meeting even though those plans hadn’t yet been discussed with the full committee, much less the general public.
Thus, while prohibitions on owning stocks of specific companies may be a sensible restriction for many other public agencies, such rules are practically irrelevant for Federal Reserve officials, who could easily garner profits by investing in broad market indexes. Furthermore, a 45-day waiting period is simply too short to ensure that Fed officials do not profit from nonpublic information. To restore public confidence, the Federal Reserve must move promptly to require all top Fed officials to hold their financial assets in qualified blind trusts throughout their tenure in office.
As the sole executive officer on the Fed’s Board of Governors, the chair has a unique role in determining its agenda, executing its policies and serving as role model for other Fed officials and staff. Unfortunately, Chair Powell’s financial disclosure forms over the past several years have been far more opaque and troubling than those of any other current member of the Fed’s Board of Governors.
For example, Powell’s disclosure form for calendar year 2019 refers to very large quantities of securities transactions – both purchases and sales -- using the notation ""Multiple"" rather than disclosing the specific date of each transaction. No other current Fed Board member has used that notation on any of their financial disclosure forms. In fact, the only president of a regional Federal Reserve Bank who followed such a practice was Robert Kaplan, who recently resigned from his position as president of the Dallas Fed.
Powell’s financial disclosures are also opaque about his personal role in managing the Powell Family Trusts. Given that those funds are not qualified blind trusts, it is troubling that large transactions were made around the time of monetary policy meetings, even though such transactions were strictly prohibited by the Fed's Code of Conduct.
The reputational damage of this scandal has been magnified by the Fed’s failure to follow its own policy in responding to recent revelations. In particular, the Fed must promptly request law enforcement agencies to join the Fed’s inspector general in investigating whether any laws were broken. The involvement of law enforcement agencies is crucial to avoid potential conflicts of interest in carrying out this investigation. After all, the Federal Reserve’s inspector general is merely an employee who reports directly to the Fed’s chair and who can be terminated by a vote of the Fed’s board. Thus, a credible and swift investigation requires active cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve should welcome non-partisan congressional legislation to strengthen public confidence in the Fed’s ethics and integrity. The Fed’s inspector general should become a fully independent official, appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, just like at all other major federal agencies. In combination with the actions noted above, this measure will help restore the Fed’s reputation and bolster its effectiveness in carrying out its crucial mission as America’s central bank.",https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/579746-the-federal-reserves-ethics-scandal-is-not-resolved

16,"Is inflation ""transitory""? Some economists say to brace for the long term",2021-11-03T10:48:00Z,"The Federal Reserve describes higher inflation as fleeting, but economists expect it to stick around into 2022.","The Federal Reserve has stuck to its characterization of this year's higher inflation as a ""transitory"" issue. But after six months of higher prices touching everything from food to energy prices, some economists say the phenomenon appears to be sticking around — and could last well into 2022.
""I think probably another word is needed,"" noted Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. Although, she added wryly, ""transitory"" could simply mean ""it won't persist in perpetuity.""
Such price hikes are sending shocks through household budgets, following almost a decade when inflation rose between 1% to 2% annually. But in 2021, inflation is forecast to stand close to 5%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. That's souring Americans on the nation's financial outlook, with more than 6 in 10 calling the economy poor, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Unfortunately, inflation isn't likely to return to its pre-2021 levels within the next few months, economists now predict.
""Our sense is that the inflation and price increases will get worse in the near term before they get better,"" Bostjancic noted. Her forecast is that headline inflation — or inflation including gas and food prices — will stand at 5.3% in the first three months of 2022, but may start to ease in the second quarter.
Goldman Sachs analysts, meanwhile, forecast inflation will return to about 2% — but not until late 2022.
About half of Americans say they now expect the economy to worsen in the next year, compared with just 30% who think it will get better. In the AP-NORC poll conducted in February and March, the situation was reversed: 44% expected the economy to get better in the year ahead and just 32% said it would get worse.
With inflation running well above its recent norm, all eyes are now on the Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin winding down its bond-buying stimulus program.
But economists say they will also be listening for whether the Fed plans to hasten plans to boost interest rates from their current level of almost zero — a move that could help tame inflation.
For some consumers, the inflationary spike brings back memories of another era when inflation was high.
""I grew up in the 1970s and I remember it was hard for my parents to make ends meet,"" Nadine Christian, 55, told the Associated Press. ""It's not quite as bad as it was back then but I feel like any day we could go off the rails.""
""Pent-up consumer demand""
Inflation spiked higher this year due to the confluence of several pandemic trends, economists say. First, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021 spurred pent-up demand from consumers, millions of whom were flush with cash due to stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid.
But at the same time, the U.S. workforce hasn't fully recovered from the pandemic. There are still 3.2 million fewer workers today than in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the economy. Among the businesses impacted by the labor force shortage are those in the supply chain — transportation companies, warehouses and other businesses that help move goods around the U.S.
That's created what Bostjancic calls ""sticky supply-driven inflation.""
""There was huge pent-up consumer demand, and demand came back sharply, and supply couldn't keep up,"" she added.
But there's a risk if the Fed boosts interest rates more quickly than expected, Bostjancic noted. ""You could have a double-jeopardy risk that they raise rates now to combat inflation, but that it kicks in just as supply comes online and demand moderates,"" she said.
Utilities, food, paper goods
Among the businesses impacted by inflation are restaurants, which are experiencing higher demand from consumers just as they're also facing higher costs for everything from food to ""some items in the middle of the P&L (profit & loss): utilities, paper goods, plates, small wares,"" said Jim Balis, managing director at restaurant investor CapitalSpring's Strategic Operations Group.
Balis, whose company is invested in 60 different restaurant brands — although he can't disclose which ones — noted that their businesses saw an uptick in demand as vaccinations spread across the nation. Restaurant owners believed that workers would follow by returning to the labor market after the pandemic unemployment benefits expired in September, but that hasn't happened, Balis added.
""There probably is some percentage that has said, 'I want to go back to work, but under different terms or conditions' — maybe they want to work in a fulfillment center, or younger populations like companies with a cause,"" he noted.
And restaurants are also facing competition for workers, both from other industries that pay higher wages as well as rival dining establishments, he noted. That's prompting his company's restaurants to boost wages, which Balis estimates have risen by about 7% from a year earlier.
So far, he said, workers aren't arguing they need higher wages due to inflation — restaurants are offering more to simply compete with rival employers, Balis said. Economists, meanwhile, are keeping their eyes on the potential for a so-called wage-price spiral, or when rising prices create pressure on wages, which then spirals as production costs rise due to higher wages, and so on.

17,Why the Fed may be able to raise rates without making investors panic,2021-11-03T10:39:29Z,Stocks continue to hit new all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve prepares to pull back on some of the extraordinary stimulus measures it put in place when the Covid-19 pandemic ground the US economy to a halt in March 2020.,"New York (CNN Business) Stocks continue to hit new all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve prepares to pull back on some of the extraordinary stimulus measures it put in place when the Covid-19 pandemic ground the US economy to a halt in March 2020.
Fed chair Jerome Powell is widely expected to discuss plans for the central bank to start tapering its bond purchases at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
The Fed may even suggest that interest rate hikes could also be in the cards for the latter part of next year. Rates have been at zero since March 2020.
According to futures contracts on the CME , traders are pricing in a 33% chance of at least two interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, and a 25% chance of three rate increases by January 2023.
So why aren't investors throwing a so-called taper tantrum, as they did when former Fed chair Ben Bernanke hinted that the Fed would soon slow down bond buying in the summer of 2013? Back then, stocks fell sharply and long-term Treasury yields spiked.
This time around, everyone knows that the tapering is coming. Powell has been hinting for months that the economy is improving and may no longer need as much support from the Fed.
That's a big difference from nearly a decade ago, when Bernanke caught the market completely off guard when he first suggested tapering
""The Fed has been telegraphing the taper for some time. They've learned a lot and do not want to make the same mistake twice,"" said Whitney Sweeney, investment strategist at Schroders.
No taper tantrum as long as Fed sticks to playbook
Even if Powell doesn't announce the taper timeline, the market might just throw a tantrum anyway, Sweeney said. That's because investors want evidence the Fed is truly confident enough in the recovery that it can pull away the proverbial training wheels and see how the economy stands on its own.
""A taper tantrum is unlikely to happen. But we have to wait to see how Powell discusses the rate hiking cycle,"" said Jim Caron, senior portfolio manager and chief strategist with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
Caron said the Fed also seems willing to allow inflation to run a little hotter for the time being in hopes that prices start to fall next year once supply chain and labor market disruptions begin to abate.
That means the Fed would likely look to raise rates gradually instead of moving aggressively to counter fears of hyperinflation.
The market also seems to be growing confident that corporate taxes may not go up much —or even at all — anytime soon. That would be a gift to the Fed, too.
""I don't see a corporate tax rate hike coming now. There are too many fires in Washington,"" said Dan Genter, CEO and chief investment officer of RNC Genter Capital Management.
Powell, who like most Fed members sticks to the mantra that the central bank is apolitical, would likely not comment on any tax proposal. But market observers think the Fed would have more wiggle room to taper and raise rates if it doesn't having to worry about how investors might react to the prospect of higher taxes eating into profit margins.
""The Fed generally doesn't make a bet on political outcomes,"" Caron said. ""But it will react to the Biden agenda going forward once the information is out.""
In other words, Powell and other Fed members will be able to breathe a huge sigh of relief if DC gridlock prevents Biden from getting what he wants.
""In theory, the Fed is independent,"" Sweeney said. ""But higher taxes would have been a headwind. Absolutely.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/03/investing/federal-reserve-interest-rates-taper/index.html
18,"How ""substantial"" was progress for the Fed?",2021-11-03T10:00:00Z,"Last December, with COVID-19 vaccinations only just beginning and the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised it would continue supporting the recovery with $120 billion in monthly bond purchases until there had been ""substantial further progress"" in meeting...","WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Last December, with COVID-19 vaccinations only just beginning and the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised it would continue supporting the recovery with $120 billion in monthly bond purchases until there had been “substantial further progress” in meeting it goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment.
At the end of its November policy meeting on Wednesday the central bank is likely to declare that standard met, clearing the way to trim $120 billion in monthly bond buying and eventually raise interest rates.
How substantial has the progress been?
In the case of inflation, probably more than the Fed bargained for. The annual rate of price increases was 1.3%, measured by the Fed’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, at the time the “substantial further progress” benchmark was set. It has been more than 4% since May.
The job market has been more of a mixed picture.
Employment has been slower to rebound, for example, than the overall level of economic output. Gross domestic product is now above where it was pre-pandemic, while jobs remain more than 3% below that level.
In one sense that’s a promising development because it means higher worker productivity - fewer people producing an increased amount of goods and services.
But it also reflects a potential scar to the degree people who want to work aren’t getting hired, or, given the Fed’s new commitment to an inclusive recovery, to the degree job growth is not broadly shared.
That’s where the story gets tricky, and makes a Fed declaration of substantial further progress very much a judgment call.
When the Fed put the benchmark in place, the economy was about 10 million jobs short of where it was in February, 2020, before the first wave of pandemic layoffs. About half of those jobs have been regained.
Though 5 million missing jobs is a lot, Fed officials are banking that the record number of openings in the economy means the shortfall relates more to workers becoming choosier about the positions they will accept, an issue Fed policy can’t really address, rather than inadequate demand for labor, a problem it could confront. Dialing back the bond buying is the Fed’s way of saying that demand - for goods, services and workers - is strong enough now without that additional bit of help.
But it is also a narrower view of the job market than the Fed seemed to adopt last year when it began referring to maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”
A range of metrics - the unemployment rate for Blacks, the labor force participation rate for women, the share of the population overall that is working - remain significantly worse than before the pandemic.
In a broad sense progress may have been substantial over the last year. The Fed now turns to debating how much more progress is needed to meet its goals, on jobs in particular, and how much is possible while keeping inflation under control.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-jobs-progress/how-substantial-was-progress-for-the-fed-idUSL1N2RT1SI
19,EXPLAINER-Federal Reserve's taper: How does it work?,2021-11-03T10:00:00Z,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to announce on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program as early as this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to announce on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program as early as this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here’s a guide to why and how the Fed is cutting back on this key component of its crisis-era support and what that means for the size of its future balance sheet.
WHAT IS THE FED’S ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM?
The Fed has gobbled up trillions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds since the onset of the pandemic in a process known as quantitative easing to lower long-term interest rates, keep financial conditions loose and help spur demand, similar to the playbook used following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
It currently buys $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in housing-backed securities each month. Since it began the program, the Fed’s balance sheet has swelled to $8.6 trillion from $4.4 trillion. An $8 trillion stash of Treasuries and MBS account for most of its total holdings.
WHY WILL IT BEGIN TO TAPER THOSE PURCHASES?
The economy, on pace to expand this year at the fastest rate since the 1980s, no longer needs such extreme measures of support and keeping them in place could do more harm than good. For example, low mortgage rates have fueled a boom in house prices, but the problems that now afflict the economy are mostly supply issues while demand, which the bond buys most directly affect, is buoyant and shows no sign of faltering.
“They are doing it because the economy is really strong... The economy can stand on its own,” said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.
HOW DOES TAPERING WORK?
Most likely in mid-November, the Fed will each month begin to reduce the amount of Treasury securities purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion, phasing them out completely by next June. The Fed doesn’t stop the bond buys all at once “to avoid jolting financial markets and sending (market) rates higher than they would (naturally) be,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Officials have flagged they expect the roll-off to run on autopilot but could speed up or slow the pace of purchases if need be. The expected eight-month pace of tapering is also much faster than last time, indicative of the Fed’s confidence in the sharpest recovery in decades and a desire to be in a position to raise interest rates from near zero next year if inflation remains persistently high.
WHAT NEXT FOR THE FED’S BALANCE SHEET POLICY?
By next June, the Fed’s balance sheet will sit at just over $9 trillion, about $8.4 trillion of which will be bonds associated with multiple rounds of QE dating back to the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The question is what to do after that.
Last time, the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet two years after it began to raise its main short-term interest rate, also known as the Fed funds rate, by not replacing securities as they matured. Fed watchers think the central bank will also be patient and passive this time around, not least because it reduced the balance sheet too much in 2018-19.
That resulted in demand for bank reserves outstripping the Fed’s supply, causing volatility in short-term money markets and a U-turn from the Fed, which was forced to increase the balance sheet again to improve financial market functioning.
BUT IT WILL REDUCE ITS BALANCE SHEET, RIGHT?
Not necessarily. Last time around the Fed was focused on reducing its balance sheet because there was some discomfort with it as an untested policy tool. Having used their balance sheet as a main plank of policy twice since the Great Recession “officials now understand that it’s going to be brought out next recession and it’s going to be a tool in the toolkit,” said Coronado.
One option, already flagged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, would be to just hold the balance sheet steady and let the economy grow into it. As gross domestic product grows, the balance sheet would effectively shrink as a percentage of GDP, exerting less influence over time. The total balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP is now almost 36%, roughly twice what it was before the pandemic.
Others are not so sure, arguing that keeping too large a permanent balance sheet could limit its effectiveness come the next recession and might sway the Fed to reduce its size again. “These numbers are big no matter how you look at them... There are reasons to think about ‘normalizing’ some of these policy tools over time. I do think they will probably perceive some benefits, in that it will open up greater scope for doing more quantitative easing next time,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.
WHAT DO FED POLICYMAKERS SAY?
So far, few policymakers have weighed in decisively. Fed Governor Christopher Waller last month called for a shrinking of the balance sheet over the next couple of years by letting maturing securities roll off, similar to last time. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in September the Fed may want to keep longer-term rates low by retaining a large balance sheet, but counter that stimulus with a higher Fed funds rate. That, however, might raise the risk of an inverted yield curve, an argument for shrinking the balance sheet, George also said, neatly illustrating the conundrum Fed officials face as they ramp up discussions in the months ahead.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-balancesheet/explainer-federal-reserves-taper-how-does-it-work-idUSL1N2RS0WL

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gold prices eased on Wednesday, ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision, as investors await cues on the U.S. central bank’s plan to taper its pandemic-induced stimulus amid signs of rising inflation.
Spot gold fell 0.4% to $1,780.60 per ounce by 0937 GMT. U.S. gold futures for December delivery slipped 0.4% to $1,782.10 per ounce.
“Markets are expecting the Fed will announce the start of tapering today and are also pricing in rate hikes for next year, not only from the Fed but also from the European Central Bank,” said Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter Fertig.
“There might be a little bit of hesitancy, some late doubts, on whether the FOMC will really decide on tapering,” said Fertig, adding the crucial question will be about how much they will reduce the monthly bond purchases.
The Fed policy announcement is due at 1400 GMT. The central bank is likely to begin paring its monthly asset purchases by $15 billion each month, bringing them to an end by mid-2022.
Market participants are also eyeing a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday after data suggested unemployment is unlikely to rise sharply, bolstering the case for a rate hike.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Turkey’s lira underperformed on Wednesday as annual inflation neared 20%, widening the gap with the policy rate, and emerging market stocks extended losses to a seventh straight session in anticipation of tapering news from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Annual inflation in Turkey was 19.89% in October - the highest in nearly 2-1/2 years, rising from 19.58% in September. The policy rate at 16% is already well below inflation as the central bank cut by 300 basis points this year, pressured by Turkey’s president Tayyip Erdogan.
Core inflation, which strips out energy, food and some other goods, eased to 16.82% from near 17% a month earlier.
The lira fell by as much as 0.8%, but cut some losses as the number was below estimates of 20.4%. It was last trading down 0.2% at 9.627 per dollar. The currency is down almost 23%this year largely because of uncertain and unconventional monetary policy.
“The small drop in core inflation and political pressure on the central bank means that further interest rate cuts lie in store,” said Jason Tuvey, senior EM economist at Capital Economics. “We have pencilled in 100bp reduction in the one-week repo rate at this month’s meeting,” and further aggressive easing ahead, he said.
Other EM currencies traded in tight ranges with all eyes on the Fed, which is likely to start tapering pandemic-induced stimulus. A Reuters poll showed EM currencies are headed for more trouble next year as rate hikes are seen supporting the dollar.
EM stocks fell 0.2%, in their longest losing streak since July, ahead of the decision. Massive monetary policy stimulus from major central bank has helped keep up flows into EM assets during the pandemic.
China stocks were hit further by Premier Li Keqiang’s comments that China’s economy faces downward pressures. Meanwhile, China said it “resolutely opposes” Washington’s revocation of China Telecom Corp Inc’s licence to operate in the United States.
Poland’s zloty rallied 0.4% against the euro, with the central bank seen hiking the key rate by 50 basis points to 1% on Wednesday.
Ukraine dollar bonds fell to April lows as Russia’s Gazprom cut its daily volume of gas transit via Ukraine for the fourth time this year on Tuesday.
Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of war in eastern Ukraine.

After that meeting the U.S. central bank is expected to disclose plans to ease the extraordinary support measures it deployed to shore up markets and the economy during the pandemic.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that after its policy meeting the Fed will announce plans to start paring its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases as soon as this month. Those purchases are intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage borrowing and spending.

The futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were barely changed.
Tokyo's markets were closed for a holiday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.3% to 25,024.75 while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.2% to 3,498.54 after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang remarked about downward pressures on the economy.
In remarks carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, Li said the government needs to provide more support for smaller companies, reduce taxes and fees, “do a good job in ensuring the supply and price stability of electricity and coal and take strong measures to support manufacturing.”
The Kospi in Seoul gave up 1.3% to 2,975.71, while Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 surged 0.9% to 7,392.70. Taiwan also advanced.
Most Asian countries have kept their monetary policy loose to deal with the fallout from pandemic-related shutdowns and travel restrictions. But some central banks have begun easing up on the accelerator in response to surging prices.
That includes New Zealand, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.4%, its lowest level in 14 years, despite a lockdown in the largest city of Auckland, Statistics New Zealand reported Wednesday. The country's share benchmark was barely changed.
New Zealand's Reserve Bank doubled the benchmark rate to 0.5% last month in its first hike in more than seven years. The jobless figures, along with high inflation numbers, will keep pressure on the nation’s central bank to continue raising interest rates.

The Russell 2000 index hit its first all-time high since March, picking up 0.2% to 2,361.86.
Investors have been mining corporate earnings for clues as to how companies are faring as the economy moves past the pandemic.
Bond yields slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.52% from 1.54% late Tuesday.
Later Wednesday, investors will get an update on services, which make up a big part of the U.S. economy, when the Institute for Supply Management releases its service sector index for October.
The central bank’s plan to trim its bond purchases also comes as businesses and consumers contend with higher costs for raw materials and finished goods. Supply chain problems are cutting into corporate finances and prompting companies to raise prices.
The employment market recovery is another focus for the central bank. The job market has lagged the rest of the economic recovery as people hesitate to return to work. Investors will get another update Friday when the Labor Department releases its jobs report for October.
In other trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 113.87 Japanese yen from 113.97 yen. The euro rose to $1.1589 from $1.1580.

Shares were mixed in cautious trading in Europe and Asia ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday.
After that meeting the U.S. central bank is expected to disclose plans to ease the extraordinary support measures it deployed to shore up markets and the economy during the pandemic.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that after its policy meeting the Fed will announce plans to start paring its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases as soon as this month. Those purchases are intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage borrowing and spending.
“Markets are largely in wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. Fed meeting. The question is not so much one of tapering, which at this point seems a foregone conclusion, but more about the timing of future rate hikes,"" Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.
Germany's DAX edged less than 0.1% lower to 15,497.84, while the CAC 40 in Paris inched up 0.1% to 6,935.01. In London, the FTSE 100 was flat at 7,273.75.

The futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were barely changed.
Tokyo's markets were closed for a holiday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.3% to 25,024.75 while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.2% to 3,498.54 after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang remarked about downward pressures on the economy.
In remarks carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, Li said the government needs to provide more support for smaller companies, reduce taxes and fees, “do a good job in ensuring the supply and price stability of electricity and coal and take strong measures to support manufacturing.”
The Kospi in Seoul gave up 1.3% to 2,975.71, while Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 surged 0.9% to 7,392.70. Taiwan also advanced.
Most Asian countries have kept their monetary policy loose to deal with the fallout from pandemic-related shutdowns and travel restrictions. But some central banks have begun easing up on the accelerator in response to surging prices.

That includes New Zealand, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.4%, its lowest level in 14 years, despite a lockdown in the largest city of Auckland, Statistics New Zealand reported Wednesday. The country's share benchmark was barely changed.
New Zealand's Reserve Bank doubled the benchmark rate to 0.5% last month in its first hike in more than seven years. The jobless figures, along with high inflation numbers, will keep pressure on the nation’s central bank to continue raising interest rates.
On Tuesday, the Dow gained 0.4% to 36,052.63, while the S&P 500 index extended its winning streak into a fourth day, climbing to 4,630.65. The Dow gained 0.4% to 36,052.63, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3% to 15,649.60.
The Russell 2000 index hit its first all-time high since March, picking up 0.2% to 2,361.86.
Investors have been mining corporate earnings for clues as to how companies are faring as the economy moves past the pandemic.

Bond yields slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.52% from 1.54% late Tuesday.
Later Wednesday, investors will get an update on services, which make up a big part of the U.S. economy, when the Institute for Supply Management releases its service sector index for October.
The central bank’s plan to trim its bond purchases also comes as businesses and consumers contend with higher costs for raw materials and finished goods. Supply chain problems are cutting into corporate finances and prompting companies to raise prices.
The employment market recovery is another focus for the central bank. The job market has lagged the rest of the economic recovery as people hesitate to return to work. Investors will get another update Friday when the Labor Department releases its jobs report for October.
In other trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 113.87 Japanese yen from 113.97 yen. The euro rose to $1.1589 from $1.1580.

Moves were slight in Asia ahead of the Fed’s meeting later in the day and the dollar bought 113.84 yen, against a 2021 peak of 114.69, and traded at $1.1582 per euro against the year’s top of $1.1522 per euro. The U.S. dollar index held overnight gains to sit at 94.074.
The Fed is expected to announce the tapering of its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase programme in its policy statement at 1800 GMT.
But traders are focused on clues around what that means for timing of rate rises, after a month of seismic bond market moves in anticipation of hikes as soon as next year. [US/]
“The market is not easily convinced that there will be an extended lag between the completion of taper and the start of the rate hiking cycle,” said OCBC Bank rates strategist Frances Cheung.
“Fed Fund futures pricing of two rate hikes by end-2022 does not look as stretched as the pricing in markets such as SONIA futures (GBP) or bank bill futures (AUD).”
A day ago, the Reserve Bank of Australia abandoned its short-term yield target and dropped its expectation of holding rates at record lows until 2024, though the Aussie fell because the bank also pushed back on aggressive pricing for 2022 hikes.
The Aussie had dropped 1.2% against the dollar on Tuesday and sat at $0.7436 on Wednesday. The kiwi was also dragged 1% lower, but found support on Wednesday from strong labour data and hovered at $0.7120. [AUD/]
Currency markets’ next moves likely depend on traders’ perceptions of the relative pace of policy tightening and on whether markets can stick with an assumption that the Fed funds rate won’t get much higher than 1.75% through the cycle.
“Fed Policy is under challenge in ways that cannot be remembered since the early Volcker years,” said Deutsche Bank strategist Alan Ruskin.
“Inflation is taking off with an economy that has been pricing itself off zero nominal rates and dramatic negative real rates for the last 18 months,” he said.
So far, Ruskin added, the dollar had been held back by rising expectations of even faster hiking elsewhere in the world, but risks lie ahead if traders start to think that more than a few rate rises will be needed to tame fast-rising prices.
“If the expected resilience of the real economy to rate hikes is correct, and inflation is similarly stubborn, the market expectations on the terminal funds rate at near 1.75% by the end of 2026 looks way too low,” he said.
Also ahead this week is a Bank of England meeting where swaps pricing points to a modest rate hike, but a falling currency suggests a risk of disappointment or at least of a fairly stern push back against market inflation expectations.
“I lean towards a 15bps hike at this meeting with a 5-4 vote in favour,” said Luke Suddards, strategist at broker Pepperstone.
“However, because this is basically baked into the price, I would say the risk is for sterling to weaken if they decided rather to hold and we see some dovish repricing in money markets.”
Sterling sat just above a two-week low at $1.3628 in Asia, roughly in the bottom half of range it has traded since July.
Besides the Fed meeting, eurozone unemployment data is due later on Wednesday and several European Central Bank officials make public appearances, with French central bank head Francois Villeroy de Galhau the most notable at 1300 GMT.

U.S. central bankers, in the minutes of their Sept. 21-22 meeting, signaled that a “taper” of the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases would be approved at this week’s gathering of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
What the minutes described as an “illustrative tapering path” would trim the purchases by $15 billion per month beginning in November or December, a pace and starting point that would end the program by June or July.
(For graphic on Fed balance sheet by era - )
Of more note now is how the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement, and particularly its description of inflation as “largely reflecting transitory factors.”
Fed officials still largely hold that view. By some time in 2022 they anticipate that global supply bottlenecks will have eased, pandemic-fueled demand for goods among U.S. consumers will cool after massive spending on cars, motorcycles and appliances, and enough people will be pushing to return to jobs that the pace of wage and benefit increases will also subside.
But in recent weeks Fed officials have acknowledged the risks to that outlook. The jump in inflation this year has already lasted longer than anticipated; headline rates are running at twice the Fed’s 2% target; and rising rents, low business inventories, and large numbers of workers still waiting on the sidelines may mean the high pace of price increases will continue for now.
(For graphic on ""Broad-based"" or not? ""Broad-based"" or not? - )
The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policymakers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it. Investors are acting as if the Fed’s patience will run out soon.
The Fed cut its overnight benchmark federal funds interest rate to the near-zero level last year in a bid to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. Trading in federal funds futures currently show investors expecting up to three quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2022; Fed officials as of September were split over whether there would even be one.
“Will they hold on to the transitory description of inflation? My best guess is they will,” in order to keep their commitment to support the economic recovery until the economy is closer to full employment, said Aneta Markowska, an economist at Jefferies. “If they were being intellectually honest they would probably drop it, but given what is happening in the market the Fed has to tread carefully.”
Push back too hard on the current market expectations, by emphasizing the 5 million U.S. jobs still missing from before the pandemic, and it could “unhinge” the market outlook for inflation, she noted. Lean too hard on inflation risks, and it could push rate hike expectations even higher, begin to restrict credit and borrowing, and slow the recovery.
EYES ON POWELL
The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). It will not issue new economic forecasts, so beyond the statement it will be up to Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his news conference half an hour later to strike a balance between the two sides of the central bank’s mandated goals of achieving maximum employment and stable prices.
This will be a critical communications moment for Powell whose term as Fed chief ends in February 2022. The White House has yet to announce whether the former investment banker will be reappointed to a second term.
Through much of the pandemic, Powell’s bias - and that of most other Fed policymakers - has been in favor of the job market, in line with the central bank’s new strategic approach to allow more risks with higher inflation in order to push job growth as high as possible.
The Fed currently says it will not raise rates until inflation has not just risen to its 2% target, but is on track to exceed it “for some time,” so that the 2% level is maintained on average following years in which it ran low.
That phrase has not been quantified in terms of how much or how long an overshoot of inflation is intended. While Fed policymakers have generally described achievement of the inflation benchmark as still “a ways off,” a few have noted that the averages are creeping higher already.
(For graphic on Inflation, on average Inflation, on average - )
The labor market rebound has also taken on a different course than Fed officials expected. Despite near-record numbers of job openings, labor force participation is improving only slowly - with workers by choice or family necessity taking more time to return to jobs, and using savings elevated by pandemic benefit payments to cover the bills in the meantime.
The employment-to-population ratio is still 2.4 percentage points below where it was at the outset of the pandemic in February 2020, less than half the ground needed to be covered to return to the previous level.
(For graphic on The jobs hole facing Biden and the Fed - )
The discussion over the taper of the Fed’s purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will likely end on Wednesday with the central bank declaring that the economy has made “substantial further progress” in healing from the pandemic.
(For graphic on ""Substantial further progress"" for the Fed? - )
The debate will then turn to how much more the job market can improve, how fast it can be done, and whether COVID-19 has changed the economy in ways that mean higher inflation with fewer people working.
“If the Fed projects that inflation will not revert to target within a reasonable amount of time, then the Fed could step up the tightening schedule even if employment is short of the mandate,” Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, wrote ahead of the policy decision. “The Fed could tell this story after this week’s meeting. In practice, the Fed has made pretty clear it is waiting for more inflation data” to see if the “transitory” narrative holds.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed/with-bond-buying-taper-in-the-bag-fed-turns-a-wary-eye-to-inflation-idUSKBN2HO0AD

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gaining a full understanding of how job market dynamics have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will take some time, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.
Powell, speaking at a press conference after the Fed's latest policy meeting, said this summer's wave of infections from the Delta variant disrupted what had been a robust pace of recovery in the job market and upended expectations for large job gains to persist as enhanced jobless benefits expired and schools reopened this fall.
""There's room for a whole lot of humility here as we try to think about what maximum employment would be,"" Powell said.
People continue to stay out of the job market in part due to COVID-19, care taking responsibilities and concerns about the virus, he said, and it could take some time to see a fuller recovery in employment and labor market participation.
The pre-pandemic labor market may not be the best standard to use when assessing what maximum employment could look like, given changes in consumer preferences and other surprises in the way the economy behaved during the pandemic, Powell said.
Officials need to see how the economy evolves in a world where there is not a new surge in coronavirus infections, he said.
""It’s a different world in so many ways, and we’re very open to that,"" he said.
One thing is clear: the economy is not yet at maximum employment, meaning it is not yet time to raise interest rates, Powell said. But the labor market could reach full employment by the second half of next year if it continues to improve at the same pace seen over the last year, he added. read more
Policymakers will be watching employment levels, labor force participation, wages and quit rates, among other indicators, to make a judgment on the labor market, Powell said.
""The learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that over time you can get to places that didn’t look possible,"" Powell said.

Investing.com - The dollar traded largely unchanged Wednesday at elevated levels, braced for the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and forward guidance later.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded marginally lower at 94.055, but not far removed from a near 3-week high of 94.313.
Additionally, rose 0.1% to 1.1587, marginally above the year’s low of 1.1522, while fell 0.1% to 113.89, below the 2021 peak of 114.69.
The Fed is widely expected to announce a tapering of its current $120 billion monthly bond-buying program, judging the U.S. economy as being sufficiently recovered from the pandemic hit to cope with a reduction in support.
“The Fed is ready to pull the tapering trigger this Wednesday and we see risks clearly tilted towards a swifter process than anticipated by the consensus,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
Potentially of more interest is what the Fed policy makers say about rising prices, with inflation at 30-year highs, and the impact this has on their thinking as to when interest rates should start rising. Officials have said rate hikes won’t be on the table until the bond-buying program ends.
“Our new base case is a hike in June, September and December next year after a tapering process ending in April/May,” Nordea added. Most analysts expect the purchases to be phased out by the end of June.
Elsewhere, rose 0.1% to 1.3626, just above a two-week low, ahead of a on Thursday.

By Lindsay (NYSE: ) Dunsmuir
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to announce on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program as early as this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here's a guide to why and how the Fed is cutting back on this key component of its crisis-era support and what that means for the size of its future balance sheet.
WHAT IS THE FED'S ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM?
The Fed has gobbled up trillions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds since the onset of the pandemic in a process known as quantitative easing to lower long-term interest rates, keep financial conditions loose and help spur demand, similar to the playbook used following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
It currently buys $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in housing-backed securities each month. Since it began the program, the Fed's balance sheet has swelled to $8.6 trillion from $4.4 trillion. An $8 trillion stash of Treasuries and MBS account for most of its total holdings.
WHY WILL IT BEGIN TO TAPER THOSE PURCHASES?
The economy, on pace to expand this year at the fastest rate since the 1980s, no longer needs such extreme measures of support and keeping them in place could do more harm than good. For example, low mortgage rates have fueled a boom in house prices, but the problems that now afflict the economy are mostly supply issues while demand, which the bond buys most directly affect, is buoyant and shows no sign of faltering.
""They are doing it because the economy is really strong... The economy can stand on its own,"" said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.
(GRAPHIC: Get ready to taper - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/dwvkraoolpm/chart.png)
HOW DOES TAPERING WORK?
Most likely in mid-November, the Fed will each month begin to reduce the amount of Treasury securities purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion, phasing them out completely by next June. The Fed doesn't stop the bond buys all at once ""to avoid jolting financial markets and sending (market) rates higher than they would (naturally) be,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Officials have flagged they expect the roll-off to run on autopilot but could speed up or slow the pace of purchases if need be. The expected eight-month pace of tapering is also much faster than last time, indicative of the Fed's confidence in the sharpest recovery in decades and a desire to be in a position to raise interest rates from near zero next year if inflation remains persistently high.
WHAT NEXT FOR THE FED'S BALANCE SHEET POLICY?
By next June, the Fed's balance sheet will sit at just over $9 trillion, about $8.4 trillion of which will be bonds associated with multiple rounds of QE dating back to the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The question is what to do after that.
Last time, the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet two years after it began to raise its main short-term interest rate, also known as the Fed funds rate, by not replacing securities as they matured. Fed watchers think the central bank will also be patient and passive this time around, not least because it reduced the balance sheet too much in 2018-19.
That resulted in demand for bank reserves outstripping the Fed's supply, causing volatility in short-term money markets and a U-turn from the Fed, which was forced to increase the balance sheet again to improve financial market functioning.
(GRAPHIC: Fed balance sheet by era Fed balance sheet by era - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/TAPER/xmpjolmanvr/chart.png)
BUT IT WILL REDUCE ITS BALANCE SHEET, RIGHT?
Not necessarily. Last time around the Fed was focused on reducing its balance sheet because there was some discomfort with it as an untested policy tool. Having used their balance sheet as a main plank of policy twice since the Great Recession ""officials now understand that it's going to be brought out next recession and it's going to be a tool in the toolkit,"" said Coronado.
One option, already flagged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, would be to just hold the balance sheet steady and let the economy grow into it. As gross domestic product grows, the balance sheet would effectively shrink as a percentage of GDP, exerting less influence over time. The total balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP is now almost 36%, roughly twice what it was before the pandemic.
Others are not so sure, arguing that keeping too large a permanent balance sheet could limit its effectiveness come the next recession and might sway the Fed to reduce its size again. ""These numbers are big no matter how you look at them... There are reasons to think about 'normalizing' some of these policy tools over time. I do think they will probably perceive some benefits, in that it will open up greater scope for doing more quantitative easing next time,"" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank (DE: ).
WHAT DO FED POLICYMAKERS SAY?
So far, few policymakers have weighed in decisively. Fed Governor Christopher Waller last month called for a shrinking of the balance sheet over the next couple of years by letting maturing securities roll off, similar to last time. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in September the Fed may want to keep longer-term rates low by retaining a large balance sheet, but counter that stimulus with a higher Fed funds rate. That, however, might raise the risk of an inverted yield curve, an argument for shrinking the balance sheet, George also said, neatly illustrating the conundrum Fed officials face as they ramp up discussions in the months ahead.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainerfederal-reserves-taper-how-does-it-work-2665624

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, remaining near record levels ahead of the conclusion of a much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, while climbed 8 points, or 0.1%.
The three major indices all closed at record levels for the third session in a row on Tuesday, boosted by solid corporate earnings. The blue-chip gained almost 140 points, ending 0.4% higher, while the broad-based closed up 0.4% and the technology-focused gained 0.3%.
The is widely expected to announce the withdrawal of pandemic-era stimulus when it concludes the latest two-day meeting later Wednesday.
Investors will also be listening to what the Fed policy makers say about recent price rises, with inflation at 30-year highs, given that for months they have insisted such increases would be transitory.

Having risen sharply over the past week on expectations for higher inflation and interest rates, bond yields have pulled back from multi-month highs as investors reassess their most aggressive pricing for European Central Bank rate hikes over the next year.
Italian 10-year bond yields, for instance, fell 13 basis points (bps) on Tuesday in their biggest one-day fall since May 2020. They were down 2 bps in early trade at 1.06% , moving further away from Monday's more than one-year highs near 1.29%.
German bond yields too were lower, with 10-year Bund yields down around 2 bps at -0.18% and holding below roughly 2-1/2 year highs hit last week at -0.064% .
Data released on Tuesday showed ECB bond buying slowed last week. The central bank bought a net 7.526 billion euros ($8.72 billion) of assets as part of its quantitative easing programme, below the 28.166 billion euros it purchased a week earlier.
Reduced ECB support helps explain the sharp rise in bond yields over the past week, analysts said.
Also, bond markets have become more volatile in recent months, with yields swinging sharply as investors try to assess the outlook for inflation and what that means for ECB policy.
For now, calm took hold as focus turned to the Fed, which concludes a two-day meeting later in the session.
Markets are almost certain the Fed will taper its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase programme but are looking to see if policymakers will give any hints about the possibility of interest rate hikes next year.
""As both taper start and pace have been clearly communicated, today's announcement should catch no one by surprise,"" said Michael Leister, head of interest rates strategy at Commerzbank.
""On the contrary, it may trigger some ""buy-the-fact"" trades, as (Fed Chief Jerome) Powell could be inclined to strike a more dovish tone on rates and play down the flow impact from tapering.""

BoE meets on Thursday
NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would begin unwinding its pandemic-era stimulus, but held to its belief that high inflation would prove ""transitory"" and likely not require a rapid rise in interest rates.
The Fed announced a $15 billion monthly cut to its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, but did little to signal when it may begin the next phase of policy ""normalization"" by raising interest rates.
The dollar index softened after the Fed statement, hitting a session low before reversing some of the losses and was last down 0.045% at 94.068, still within reach of its 2021 peak of 94.563 hit last month.
The initial sell-off in the dollar after the Fed announcement was likely profit-taking, said Scott Petruska, chief currency strategist at Silicon Valley Bank.
""The market was extremely long dollars going into this and they still are,"" he said.
Over the rest of the quarter, the dollar will be supported by relatively higher U.S. yields, the Fed showing an eagerness to stop inflation and admitting to some extent that inflation may not be as transitory as they initially thought, and as a safe haven, he said.

The RBA on Tuesday abandoned its short-term yield target and dropped its expectation of holding rates at record lows until 2024, though the Aussie fell because the bank also pushed back on aggressive pricing for 2022 hikes. read more
The Aussie dropped 1.2% against the dollar on Tuesday and sat at $0.7425 on Wednesday, down 0.05% from the session open. The New Zealand dollar was also dragged 1% lower on Tuesday, but found support on Wednesday from strong labor data and was up 0.27% at $0.71285.
Money markets have dialled back expectations for a 15 basis point hike from the Bank of England on Thursday but still expect one before 2022.
""The key question is how effective an interest rate hike will be in controlling inflation, mainly driven by supply chain issues, as we emerge from the pandemic,"" said Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM.
The BoE is also focused on labor data and may decide to hold off on rate increases on Thursday, as ""they will not want to hike rates too soon and risk crippling businesses’ recoveries,"" he said.
Sterling recovered from a two-week low to trade 0.3% higher at $1.36525.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here's a guide to why and how the Fed is cutting back on this key component of its crisis-era support and what that means for the size of its future balance sheet.
WHAT IS THE FED'S ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM?
The Fed has gobbled up trillions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) since the onset of the pandemic in a process known as quantitative easing (QE) to lower long-term interest rates, keep financial conditions loose and help spur demand, similar to the playbook used following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
It currently buys $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in housing-backed securities each month. Since it began the program, the Fed's balance sheet has swelled to $8.6 trillion from $4.4 trillion. An $8 trillion stash of Treasuries and MBS account for most of its total holdings.
WHY WILL IT BEGIN TO TAPER THOSE PURCHASES?
The economy, on pace to expand this year at the fastest rate since the 1980s, no longer needs such extreme measures of support and keeping them in place could do more harm than good. For example, low mortgage rates have fueled a boom in house prices, but the problems that now afflict the economy are mostly supply issues while demand, which the bond buys most directly affect, is buoyant and shows no sign of faltering.
""They are doing it because the economy is really strong... The economy can stand on its own,"" said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.
HOW DOES TAPERING WORK?
The Fed announced that in mid November and December it will reduce the amount of Treasury securities purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion. It expects to continue that pace in the months ahead, meaning it would phase out the bond buys completely by next June. The Fed doesn't stop them all at once ""to avoid jolting financial markets and sending (market) rates higher than they would (naturally) be,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Officials also said they could speed up or slow the pace of purchases if need be. The expected eight-month pace of tapering is also much faster than last time, indicative of the Fed's confidence in the sharpest recovery in decades and a desire to be in a position to raise interest rates from near zero next year if inflation remains persistently high.
WHAT NEXT FOR THE FED'S BALANCE SHEET POLICY?
By next June, the Fed's balance sheet will sit at just over $9 trillion, about $8.4 trillion of which will be bonds associated with multiple rounds of QE dating back to the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The question is what to do after that.
Last time, the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet two years after it began to raise its main short-term interest rate, also known as the Fed funds rate, by not replacing securities as they matured. Fed watchers think the central bank will also be patient and passive this time around, not least because it reduced the balance sheet too much in 2018-19.
That resulted in demand for bank reserves outstripping the Fed's supply, causing volatility in short-term money markets and a U-turn from the Fed, which was forced to increase the balance sheet again to improve financial market functioning.
BUT IT WILL REDUCE ITS BALANCE SHEET, RIGHT?
Not necessarily. Last time around the Fed was focused on reducing its balance sheet because there was some discomfort with it as an untested policy tool. Having used their balance sheet as a main plank of policy twice since the Great Recession ""officials now understand that it's going to be brought out next recession and it's going to be a tool in the toolkit,"" said Coronado.
One option, already flagged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, would be to just hold the balance sheet steady and let the economy grow into it. As gross domestic product grows, the balance sheet would effectively shrink as a percentage of GDP, exerting less influence over time. The total balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP is now almost 36%, roughly twice what it was before the pandemic.
Others are not so sure, arguing that keeping too large a permanent balance sheet could limit its effectiveness come the next recession and might sway the Fed to reduce its size again. ""These numbers are big no matter how you look at them... There are reasons to think about 'normalizing' some of these policy tools over time. I do think they will probably perceive some benefits, in that it will open up greater scope for doing more quantitative easing next time,"" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank.
WHAT DO FED POLICYMAKERS SAY?
So far, few policymakers have weighed in decisively. Fed Governor Christopher Waller last month called for a shrinking of the balance sheet over the next couple of years by letting maturing securities roll off, similar to last time. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in September the Fed may want to keep longer-term rates low by retaining a large balance sheet, but counter that stimulus with a higher Fed funds rate. That, however, might raise the risk of an inverted yield curve, an argument for shrinking the balance sheet, George also said, neatly illustrating the conundrum Fed officials face as they ramp up discussions in the months ahead.

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Last December, with COVID-19 vaccinations only just beginning and the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised it would continue supporting the recovery with $120 billion in monthly bond purchases until there had been ""substantial further progress"" in meeting it goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment.
At the end of its November policy meeting on Wednesday the central bank is likely to declare that standard met, clearing the way to trim $120 billion in monthly bond buying and eventually raise interest rates. read more
How substantial has the progress been?
In the case of inflation, probably more than the Fed bargained for. The annual rate of price increases was 1.3%, measured by the Fed's preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, at the time the ""substantial further progress"" benchmark was set. It has been more than 4% since May.
Reuters Graphics
The job market has been more of a mixed picture.
Employment has been slower to rebound, for example, than the overall level of economic output. Gross domestic product is now above where it was pre-pandemic, while jobs remain more than 3% below that level.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
In one sense that's a promising development because it means higher worker productivity - fewer people producing an increased amount of goods and services.
But it also reflects a potential scar to the degree people who want to work aren't getting hired, or, given the Fed's new commitment to an inclusive recovery, to the degree job growth is not broadly shared.
That's where the story gets tricky, and makes a Fed declaration of substantial further progress very much a judgment call.
When the Fed put the benchmark in place, the economy was about 10 million jobs short of where it was in February, 2020, before the first wave of pandemic layoffs. About half of those jobs have been regained.
Reuters Graphics
Though 5 million missing jobs is a lot, Fed officials are banking that the record number of openings in the economy means the shortfall relates more to workers becoming choosier about the positions they will accept, an issue Fed policy can't really address, rather than inadequate demand for labor, a problem it could confront. Dialing back the bond buying is the Fed's way of saying that demand - for goods, services and workers - is strong enough now without that additional bit of help.
But it is also a narrower view of the job market than the Fed seemed to adopt last year when it began referring to maximum employment as a ""broad-based and inclusive goal.""
A range of metrics - the unemployment rate for Blacks, the labor force participation rate for women, the share of the population overall that is working - remain significantly worse than before the pandemic.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
In a broad sense progress may have been substantial over the last year. The Fed now turns to debating how much more progress is needed to meet its goals, on jobs in particular, and how much is possible while keeping inflation under control.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's taper in 2014 was preceded by sharp gyrations in Treasury markets and helped lay the foundations for a massive rally in the U.S. dollar.
With the Fed widely expected to soon begin an unwind of its $120 billion in government bond buying, here’s a comparison between the market backdrop around the time of the Fed’s most recent unwind and today.
TAPER TIME
The Fed’s taper of the $85 billion a month bond buying program, which it began in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, ran from January 2014 until October of that year.
Since then the central bank’s balance sheet has ballooned to $8.6 trillion as policymakers slashed rates to near zero and rolled out a raft of measures, including monthly government backed bond purchases, as they fought to support the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak last year.
The central bank concludes its November monetary policy meeting on Wednesday.
The Fed's balance sheet
THE DOLLAR
Yield spread and the U.S. dollar
While U.S. monetary policy was far from hawkish in 2014, it stood in contrast to the ultra-dovish trajectories of central banks in Europe, Japan and other countries, who were still fully supporting their economies with stimulus while the Fed was curtailing its bond buying.
A widening between the yields on U.S. Treasuries and government bonds in other countries helped spark a rally in the dollar, which rose nearly 13% against a basket of major currencies in 2014. (.DXY)
The global monetary policy picture is different this time around, with some investors betting that central banks in the U.K., Canada and other economies are likely to soon raise interest rates to combat a global surge in inflation. read more
Signs that the Fed is more concerned about inflation than it has previously indicated, however, could buoy U.S. rates and potentially support the greenback, analysts said.
BOND YIELDS
Bond yields rocketed higher in 2013, after then-Fed chief Ben Bernanke alluded to the policymaker's thinking on plans for pulling back its monetary support in an appearance before lawmakers.
U.S. 10-year yield
This time around, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has tried to prepare markets for the start of a taper well in advance.
Still, U.S. bond markets have experienced gyrations in recent weeks as some investors bet the central bank will need to be more hawkish than expected to combat inflation. read more
Meanwhile, rising yields on expectations of tighter monetary policy and rebounding growth have put the U.S. bond market on track for its worst year since 2013. Yields move inversely to prices.

STOCKS
The S&P 500 (.SPX) stood near record highs as the Fed kicked off its taper in 2014 and continued to fresh peaks after the unwind began.
Though stocks are at records today as well, valuations have ballooned over the years, leading some investors to worry that some areas of the market--including the big growth and technology stocks that make up a large chunk of the S&P 500--may be more vulnerable to higher yields and a more hawkish monetary policy stance. read more

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said it is possible the U.S. job market may have improved enough by the middle of next year to be considered at ""maximum employment,"" a key hurdle to clear for the central bank to consider increasing interest rates.
Powell, speaking at a press conference after the Fed's latest policy meeting, also said officials did not see ""troubling increases"" in workers' wages that might raise the risk of a ""wage-price spiral"" phenomenon developing that could force the Fed to act sooner than expected to contain inflation.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - Asian currencies slipped on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected commentary on unwinding its pandemic-era policy support, while Thailand's baht weakened on a bleak economic growth forecast for the year.
The South Korean won declined 0.6% to lead losses, followed by the Indonesian rupiah and the Taiwanese dollar , against a firm dollar as investors awaited clues on a rate hike outlook heading into next year.
""Markets are largely in wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. Fed meeting,"" Mizuho analysts wrote.
""The question is not so much one of tapering, which at this point seems a foregone conclusion, but more about the timing of future rate hikes,"" they added, as several Asian central banks still seem very far away from tightening monetary policy.
The baht fell 0.4% after the deputy prime minister said the country's economic growth would be subdued this year owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thailand this week re-opened its borders to fully vaccinated tourists after about 18 months of restrictions, but investors feel it is a little too early to determine its impact on the country's economy.

Markets focused on Powell's news conference
WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to detail plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases by mid-2022 as policymakers shift their focus towards what, if anything, to do about a surge in inflation that is lasting longer than anticipated.
U.S. central bankers, in the minutes of their Sept. 21-22 meeting, signaled that a ""taper"" of the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases would be approved at this week's gathering of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
What the minutes described as an ""illustrative tapering path"" would trim the purchases by $15 billion per month beginning in November or December, a pace and starting point that would end the program by June or July.

Of more note now is how the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement, and particularly its description of inflation as ""largely reflecting transitory factors.""
Fed officials still largely hold that view. By some time in 2022 they anticipate that global supply bottlenecks will have eased, pandemic-fueled demand for goods among U.S. consumers will cool after massive spending on cars, motorcycles and appliances, and enough people will be pushing to return to jobs that the pace of wage and benefit increases will also subside.
But in recent weeks Fed officials have acknowledged the risks to that outlook. The jump in inflation this year has already lasted longer than anticipated; headline rates are running at twice the Fed's 2% target; and rising rents, low business inventories, and large numbers of workers still waiting on the sidelines may mean the high pace of price increases will continue for now.
Reuters Graphics
The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policymakers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it. Investors are acting as if the Fed's patience will run out soon.
The Fed cut its overnight benchmark federal funds interest rate to the near-zero level last year in a bid to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. Trading in federal funds futures currently show investors expecting up to three quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2022; Fed officials as of September were split over whether there would even be one.
""Will they hold on to the transitory description of inflation? My best guess is they will,"" in order to keep their commitment to support the economic recovery until the economy is closer to full employment, said Aneta Markowska, an economist at Jefferies. ""If they were being intellectually honest they would probably drop it, but given what is happening in the market the Fed has to tread carefully.""
Push back too hard on the current market expectations, by emphasizing the 5 million U.S. jobs still missing from before the pandemic, and it could ""unhinge"" the market outlook for inflation, she noted. Lean too hard on inflation risks, and it could push rate hike expectations even higher, begin to restrict credit and borrowing, and slow the recovery.
EYES ON POWELL
The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). It will not issue new economic forecasts, so beyond the statement it will be up to Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his news conference half an hour later to strike a balance between the two sides of the central bank's mandated goals of achieving maximum employment and stable prices.
This will be a critical communications moment for Powell whose term as Fed chief ends in February 2022. The White House has yet to announce whether the former investment banker will be reappointed to a second term.
Through much of the pandemic, Powell's bias - and that of most other Fed policymakers - has been in favor of the job market, in line with the central bank's new strategic approach to allow more risks with higher inflation in order to push job growth as high as possible.
The Fed currently says it will not raise rates until inflation has not just risen to its 2% target, but is on track to exceed it ""for some time,"" so that the 2% level is maintained on average following years in which it ran low.
That phrase has not been quantified in terms of how much or how long an overshoot of inflation is intended. While Fed policymakers have generally described achievement of the inflation benchmark as still ""a ways off,"" a few have noted that the averages are creeping higher already.
Reuters Graphics
The labor market rebound has also taken on a different course than Fed officials expected. Despite near-record numbers of job openings, labor force participation is improving only slowly - with workers by choice or family necessity taking more time to return to jobs, and using savings elevated by pandemic benefit payments to cover the bills in the meantime.
The employment-to-population ratio is still 2.4 percentage points below where it was at the outset of the pandemic in February 2020, less than half the ground needed to be covered to return to the previous level.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
The discussion over the taper of the Fed's purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities will likely end on Wednesday with the central bank declaring that the economy has made ""substantial further progress"" in healing from the pandemic.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
The debate will then turn to how much more the job market can improve, how fast it can be done, and whether COVID-19 has changed the economy in ways that mean higher inflation with fewer people working.
""If the Fed projects that inflation will not revert to target within a reasonable amount of time, then the Fed could step up the tightening schedule even if employment is short of the mandate,"" Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, wrote ahead of the policy decision. ""The Fed could tell this story after this week's meeting. In practice, the Fed has made pretty clear it is waiting for more inflation data"" to see if the ""transitory"" narrative holds.

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sometimes the predictable choice is the best option. For President Joe Biden, nominating Jerome Powell for a second term as U.S. Federal Reserve chair is one of those. Powell would probably gain Senate approval without much debate. That would free up President Joe Biden to focus on other policy fights.
A second term isn’t a sure thing for Powell. One issue is inflation . In September, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 4.4% year-over-year, the fastest pace in 30 years. That makes the chair's argument that increases are transitory read more harder to justify.
On Wednesday, the Fed said it would start reducing its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases. That's the beginning of a reduction in the central bank's support for the economy. Some hawks still think runaway price increases are a risk. But Powell's chief rival for the top job is Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a dove on monetary policy. Another potential candidate, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, has also favored accommodative policies though he has sounded more hawkish lately.
Left-leaning Democrats also don't love Powell. After the party's candidate lost the race to be governor of Virginia this week, though, those voices may be heard less loudly. It's the same case with Biden's budget agenda in Congress, where the most conservative Democrats are proving crucial.
And despite a recent furor over Fed officials' trading of stocks , Powell enjoys wide bipartisan support. Elizabeth Warren is the only Democratic senator to publicly oppose his renomination. Several Republicans have urged Biden to retain him. He won the support of 84 of the 100-strong Senate in 2018 as a nominee of Donald Trump.
Getting Powell confirmed, and perhaps others Fed nominees, would help break a logjam: Senators have approved only about half as many of the president's choices as it had at the same point in Barack Obama's time in office. Brainard, for example, received 61 votes in 2014, suggesting she would face a harder time. Biden could do without another policy fight with lawmakers.
Bringing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen back is a wild card but that would leave Biden with another big post to fill. And a surprise choice for the Fed chair position is not something to spring on investors. Powell's path to a second term is looking pretty wide.

CONTEXT NEWS
- The U.S. Federal Reserve on Nov. 3 said it will start reducing its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program, which was launched last year at the start of the pandemic. Beginning later in November, the central bank will pare purchases of Treasury securities by $10 billion and of agency mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion. Starting in December, its continuing asset purchases will total at least $90 billion per month. It maintained the range for the federal funds rate at between 0% and 0.25%.

The Federal Reserve concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday by announcing plans to steadily taper off its $120 billion bond-buying program, a move widely expected by economists as the central bank begins to pull back on its pandemic-era stimulus to support the economy.

Key Facts
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, saying that it would start scaling back its bond-buying stimulus program later this month and end it by June 2022, “in light of the progress the economy has made.” The decision marks the Fed’s first step towards reducing the historic level of support it had been providing markets and the U.S. economy since the Covid-19 pandenmic. The central bank said it would begin reducing its bond purchases by $15 billion each month—with $10 billion in Treasuries and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities—but that it is also prepared to adjust the pace of purchases based on any changes to the economic outlook. Fed officials said in a statement that they still anticipate inflation, which remain near 30-year highs, as “transitory”—with the central bank clarifying that pressures are “expected” to be temporary. “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors,” the central bank admitted in its statement. Economic growth slowed in the third quarter due to supply chain constraints and inflation, which Fed chairman Jerome Powell expects to continue until mid-2022.
What To Watch For:
The stock market was relatively flat ahead of the Fed meeting, with the Dow down 100 points—but major indexes all rallied somewhat after the announcement. The Dow is now down just 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have risen 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. “Markets were prepared for a far more aggressive taper than what was ultimately delivered—the Fed has zero intentions of draining liquidity too quickly and derailing the recovery,” says Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
Key Background:
Going into the Fed meeting, the two issues weighing most heavily on the minds of investors were inflation and interest rate hikes. Inflation fears have especially spiked over the past few weeks, with the market already pricing in several rate hikes for early 2022. Third-quarter corporate earnings have so far proved resilient despite investor concerns about rising costs, labor shortages and inflation, however: Of the 362 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 81% have beaten expectations according to data from Refinitiv. Solid earnings have also helped boost stocks to record highs recently, with the S&P 500 rising over 5% in October for its best month so far this year.
Crucial Quote:
“Our asset purchases have been a critical tool” in supporting the economy, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in his press conference. “We are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.”
Chief Critic:
“The fact [Fed officials] continue to describe inflation as transitory suggests they’re going to continue to stay lower [on interest rates] for longer than many are anticipating,” Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told CNBC.

The Federal Reserve is expected to announce the tapering of its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase programme in its policy statement at 1800 GMT. Ahead of the much anticipated meeting, Asian shares failed to follow a strong lead from Wall Street. Markets are almost certain the Fed will taper but are looking to see if policymakers will give any hints about the possibility of interest rate hikes next year.
""While confidence remains that the Fed will begin its taper, there is scepticism around just how hawkish they will be on the rate hike front,"" said analysts at Westpac in a morning note to clients. Federal Reserve officials are trying to maintain a balance between raising rates to ensure inflation remains contained and giving the economy as much time as possible to restore the jobs lost since the pandemic.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.33% in early trading on Thursday. Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday. ""The shape of markets in our region may be driven more by what happens to Treasury and dollar markets overnight than what happens locally,"" said Rob Carnell, ING's Asia Pacific head of research, in a note.
The Australian benchmark share index was the biggest gainer , rising 1.3%. But those gains were outweighed by falls in Hong Kong's Hang Seng off 1%, and South Korea's KOSPI down 1.2%, even as local fintech Kakao Pay Corp saw its shares double in value from their initial public offering price on their trading debut. Chinese shares were steady after data showed service sector activity expanded in October.
On Tuesday, MSCI's all-country world index, which tracks equity performance in 50 nations, closed at a record high, helped by all three major U.S. stock indexes hitting intraday peaks during the session, and a record finish from Europe's STOXX 600 index. Strong earnings supported shares in both Europe and North America.
In contrast the Asian regional benchmark has been trending down since early this year, and is off more than 13% from its February peak, as it struggles to rebound from sweeping regulatory changes in China in the summer, which roiled sectors from property to technology. Moves in currency markets were muted on Thursday. The dollar kept within sight of its recent highs against the yen and euro.
The Aussie dollar was steady on Wednesday, having dropped 1.2% against the dollar on Tuesday after more dovish remarks from the Reserve Bank of Australia, even as it abandoned its short-term yield target. Also in central bank news, the Bank of England on Thursday could become the first of the world's biggest central banks to raise rates after the coronavirus crisis.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were steady at 1.5540%, a little off last month's recent top of 1.7%. Oil prices fell on Wednesday as industry data pointed to a big build in oil stocks in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, and as pressure mounted on OPEC to increase supply.
Brent crude fell 1.2% to $83.74 a barrel while U.S. crude tumbled 1.5% to $82.65 a barrel. Spot gold slipped 0.2%.
