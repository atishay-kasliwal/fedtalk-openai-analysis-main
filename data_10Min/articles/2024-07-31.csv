Pending home sales, a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, rose 4.8% in June from the month prior, according to the National Association of Realtors. Economists polled by Bloomberg had expected a 1.5% monthly increase. “The rise in housing inventory is beginning to lead to more contract signings,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a press statement. “Multiple offers are less intense, and buyers are in a more favorable position.” The jump in buyer activity suggests that more is likely to follow. “Even more inventory is expected to come onto the housing market in the upcoming months ahead of the normal, seasonal declines in the winter,” added Yun. “The Northeast’s small gain in contract signings is due to the ongoing housing shortage situation in that region, leading to stronger home price gains. It is a good time to list.” Mortgage rates have been a point of distress for homeowners to sell, as many were locked in at ultra-low rate during the pandemic. But rates have come down since they topped 7% earlier this summer. However, some buyers are still waiting on the sidelines as home prices reach new highs. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% from the prior week on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday. “Borrowers may be waiting for signs that mortgage rates will drift lower as the Federal Reserve begins to cut short-term rates,” Mike Fratantoni, MBA's SVP and chief economist, wrote in a statement.",

Taxes play an integral part in if companies undertake a project, a deal or more hiring. Best believe management teams and boards are running through scenarios if the Trump tax cuts aren't extended in 2025. Here's Procter & Gamble (PG) chair and CEO to me on Yahoo Finance yesterday on the 2017 Trump tax cuts: On their impact: The tax cuts have been ""incredibly impactful. And you know, that element of the dialogue is going to increase as we get through the election and start talking about 2025 when some of the tax provisions that were passed in 2017 sunset. But if you just look at our investment in the US pre- and post- the 2017 act, it's up significantly, our employment is up significantly, and, importantly, our taxes — the taxes we're paying to the US government — are up significantly. So it's really led to significant economic activity in this country."" On if the tax cuts aren't extended: ""It will certainly have an impact. Every decision that we make is based on the present value of discounted cash flow. And that's on an after-tax basis. And so it begins favoring on a comparative basis, other locations for investment. So yes, it will have an impact.""",

I think the Street is locking in on AMD's upwardly revised guidance on demand for its new AI chip. A key call-out by Citi analyst Chris Danely: ""AMD raised its MI300 sales guidance from over $4.0 billion to over $4.5 billion in calendar year 2024 given demand strength. We continue to expect more upside throughout the year and would note Microsoft (MSFT), AMD’s largest AI customer, raised its capex forecast.""",

As of this writing, shares are down about 3%. The company guided to another quarter of slower Azure growth, but then things improving over the next twelve months. Good point by Guggenheim analyst John Diffucci on this rosy Azure outlook: ""We understand that this management team has earned investors’ (and our) respect over time, but we believe investors should ask themselves a simple question: How can they trust management to predict what will happen 6-12 months from now if they have trouble forecasting the next 0-2 months (given F4Q Azure came in at the low end of the range)?""",

To illustrate how horrendous: US same-store sales down 2%, with transactions down 6% (Citi is calling this ""alarming""). China same-store sales plunged 14%, and missed consensus. International same-store sales fell 7%. So why the stock pop? Well, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan hopped on his earnings call and shared a bunch of obscure stats suggesting sales and margin trends would improve in a few quarters. He also teased a potential cost-savings action in China, likely through inking a joint venture deal. Be careful chasing any Starbucks enthusiasm. This is a management team with a credibility problem with investors, and is dealing with deeply rooted issues such as unions and poor value perception among customers. The end-game on the new battle with activist Elliott Management is also wildly unknown.",

Taxes play an integral part in if companies undertake a project, a deal or more hiring. Best believe management teams and boards are running through scenarios if the Trump tax cuts aren't extended in 2025. Here's Procter & Gamble (PG) chair and CEO to me on Yahoo Finance yesterday on the 2017 Trump tax cuts: On their impact: The tax cuts have been ""incredibly impactful. And you know, that element of the dialogue is going to increase as we get through the election and start talking about 2025 when some of the tax provisions that were passed in 2017 sunset. But if you just look at our investment in the US pre- and post- the 2017 act, it's up significantly, our employment is up significantly, and, importantly, our taxes — the taxes we're paying to the US government — are up significantly. So it's really led to significant economic activity in this country."" On if the tax cuts aren't extended: ""It will certainly have an impact. Every decision that we make is based on the present value of discounted cash flow. And that's on an after-tax basis. And so it begins favoring on a comparative basis, other locations for investment. So yes, it will have an impact.""",

I think the Street is locking in on AMD's upwardly revised guidance on demand for its new AI chip. A key call-out by Citi analyst Chris Danely: ""AMD raised its MI300 sales guidance from over $4.0 billion to over $4.5 billion in calendar year 2024 given demand strength. We continue to expect more upside throughout the year and would note Microsoft (MSFT), AMD’s largest AI customer, raised its capex forecast.""",

As of this writing, shares are down about 3%. The company guided to another quarter of slower Azure growth, but then things improving over the next twelve months. Good point by Guggenheim analyst John Diffucci on this rosy Azure outlook: ""We understand that this management team has earned investors’ (and our) respect over time, but we believe investors should ask themselves a simple question: How can they trust management to predict what will happen 6-12 months from now if they have trouble forecasting the next 0-2 months (given F4Q Azure came in at the low end of the range)?""",

To illustrate how horrendous: US same-store sales down 2%, with transactions down 6% (Citi is calling this ""alarming""). China same-store sales plunged 14%, and missed consensus. International same-store sales fell 7%. So why the stock pop? Well, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan hopped on his earnings call and shared a bunch of obscure stats suggesting sales and margin trends would improve in a few quarters. He also teased a potential cost-savings action in China, likely through inking a joint venture deal. Be careful chasing any Starbucks enthusiasm. This is a management team with a credibility problem with investors, and is dealing with deeply rooted issues such as unions and poor value perception among customers. The end-game on the new battle with activist Elliott Management is also wildly unknown.",
