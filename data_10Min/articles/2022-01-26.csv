WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as March, a key step in reversing its pandemic-era low-rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation.
With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily, the Fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases, which have been intended to lower longer-term rates, in March.
In a statement issued after its latest policy meeting, the Fed it “expects it will soon be appropriate” to raise rates.
Though the statement didn’t specifically mention March, half the Fed’s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then, including some members who have long favored low rates to support hiring.
Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed his view, as he has before, that controlling inflation is vital to a strong job market.
“We believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains,” Powell said, “is to promote a long expansion, and that will require price stability.”
The Fed on Wednesday also set out principles it will follow once it decides to reduce its nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings, a sum that has more than doubled since the pandemic struck nearly two years ago. Some analysts expect the Fed to begin doing so as soon as July, a move that would contribute to tighter credit.
The central bank’s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — costlier over time. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow consumer spending and hiring. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession.
The central bank’s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the Fed will go to reverse its low-rate policies, which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years. The broad S&P 500 index fell nearly 10% this month before rebounding slightly Wednesday.
High inflation has also become a serious political threat to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, with Republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the November elections.
Yet Biden said last week that it was “appropriate” for Powell to adjust the Fed’s policies. And congressional Republicans have endorsed Powell’s plans to raise rates, providing the Fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit.
The Fed’s bond purchases have been intended to reduce longer-term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed’s December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases. The impact of the reducing the Fed’s bond stockpile isn’t well known. But the last time that the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018. The S&P 500 stock index fell 20% in three months.
By not replacing some of its bond holdings, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries. This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive
Some analysts have said they aren’t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates.
All of which means the Powell Fed faces a delicate and even risky balancing act. If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans. Modest drops in share prices, though, won’t likely affect the Fed’s thinking.
Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation. Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively. They argue that numerous rate hikes could unnecessarily slow hiring. In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure.
This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation — consumer prices have surged 7% in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades — but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections.
Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary. The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages — to apartment rents, for example — which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely.",https://www.abc4.com/news/national/fed-plans-to-raise-rates-as-soon-as-march-to-cool-inflation/
1,Meta to scrap crypto initiative amid clash with Fed: report,2022-01-26T16:01:34Z,"Mark Zuckerberg’s controversial cryptocurrency initiative is dead in the water amid resistance from the Federal Reserve — and Meta is now looking to sell off its crypto assets altogether, according to a report.","Mark Zuckerberg’s controversial cryptocurrency initiative is dead in the water amid resistance from the Federal Reserve — and Meta is now looking to sell off its crypto assets altogether, according to a report.
The Diem Association — a crypto project formerly known as “Libra” that has been backed by the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — planned to issue a so-called stablecoin that would have been pegged to the US dollar.
Backers of the stablecoins say they have the potential to transform global finance by offering the seamless transaction speeds of cryptocurrencies without the price volatility of bitcoin or ethereum.
But from the moment that Meta and its partners unveiled plans for a stablecoin in 2019, the idea met resistance from regulators, who expressed concern about letting the scandal-plagued company control a chunk of the global financial system. Zuckerberg defended the project in a contentious contentious Congressional hearing later that year.
Despite lawmakers’ opposition, Diem and Silvergate Capital — a fintech bank that was planning to issue the stablecoin — had pushed forward with their plans until they met resistance from the Federal Reserve in 2021, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
Following several rounds of talks, Fed officials told Silvergate in the summer of 2021 that the central bank could not guarantee that it would allow the Diem project to go forward, according to the report. Silvergate was then left with no way to issue the stablecoin, Bloomberg reported.

Meta is now exploring selling its roughly one-third stake in Diem, according to the outlet.
In addition to Meta, other partners in Diem include venture capital firms Andressen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, as well as Uber, Shopify and the Singaporean state fund Temasek.
In November, a report issued by the US Treasury with contributions from the Fed, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission called on Congress to crack down on issuers of stablecoins.

Since stablecoins can pose risks including “destabilizing runs, disruptions in the payment system, and concentration of economic power,” any entity that issues a stablecoin should be regulated like a bank, the agencies said.
“Failure to act risks growth of payment stablecoins without adequate protection for users, the financial system, and the broader economy,” the report said.

But it kept rates near zero for now.
""With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed statement read.
Prices continued to climb into the end of 2021 and economists expect to see the peak of this inflation cycle in the early months of this year.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose to 5.7% in the 12 months ended in November, the fastest increase in the consumer spending price index since July 1982.
The central bank slashed rates to near zero in March 2020 when the pandemic put the US economy into a choke hold.
Last month, the Fed signaled it would hike interest rates multiple times throughout 2022. Investors expect the first rate hike to take place at the Fed's next meeting in March: Market expectations for a rate increase in March climbed above 95% following the Fed announcement, from just below 90% before, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
In November, the Fed also announced the end of its pandemic-era stimulus and accelerated the roll-back of its asset purchases the following month.
The bank will continue reducing its monthly asset purchases and end them in early March, it said Wednesday.
After the end of the stimulus program and liftoff in interest rates, reducing its massive balance sheet is next up on the Fed's to-do list. The bank affirmed that it only expects to start focusing on balance sheet reduction after the rate hikes have begun.

Asian markets tumbled. Japan's Nikkei slid 3.1% to close at its lowest level in 14 months and South Korea's Kospi slipped into a bear market after declining 3.5%. China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.8% to its lowest level since July, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 2%.
Europe's Stoxx 600, which includes companies from 17 countries, dropped 0.2% in early trading. Most major European indexes lost ground, but the United Kingdom's FTSE 100 bucked the trend, rising 0.4%.

6,ANALYSIS-Fed tightening a sign to get the 'heck out' of U.S. stocks,2022-01-26T15:15:07Z,"The S&P 500's near 10% drop so far this year has surpassed losses on most non-U.S. indexes and some reckon that recent investment outflows from the market, first in a month according to BofA, are only the beginning. Goldman Sachs' analysis of eight Federal Reserve hiking cycles since 1975 appears to support that view.","U.S. stock markets, after enjoying their best three-year run in more than two decades, may soon have to cede the top spot.
With the Fed preparing to raise interest rates https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/inflation-fighting-fed-likely-flag-march-interest-rate-hike-2022-01-26 for the first time in almost four years, capital is starting to fan out of rate-sensitive U.S. shares into other parts of the world where markets are cheaper and potentially more resilient. The S&P 500's near 10% drop so far this year has surpassed losses on most non-U.S. indexes and some reckon that recent investment outflows from the market, first in a month according to BofA, are only the beginning.
Goldman Sachs' analysis of eight Federal Reserve hiking cycles since 1975 appears to support that view. The bank found European stocks outperformed U.S. peers by four percentage points on average over six months following the first Fed rate increase.
It also observed a clear rotation into so-called value sectors such as banks and commodities which are better represented in European and emerging market equity benchmarks. ""What it means is get the heck out of the United States,"" said Mike Kelly, head of global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments. ""It's all about selling longer duration assets, so we are underexposed to U.S. equities.""
Longer-duration stocks, in a nutshell, are those whose prices are driven by expectations of future earnings potential and therefore fare well when interest rates are low. U.S. tech companies with their exorbitant valuations as measured by their price-earnings ratios (PE) are a prime example and they account for over a third of the S&P 500.
For years, those stocks were an investment magnet, benefiting from rock-bottom interest rates and recently the pandemic-time shift to working, shopping and dining from home. Of the $1 trillion which flowed into stocks last year, U.S.-dedicated funds took a third. They would also have received a lion's share of the near-$500 billion absorbed by global mandate funds, according to Deutsche Bank.
Now Kelly says, markets are at an inflection point, away from when ""PE went higher and interest rates went lower"". Given that five megacap firms accounted for a third of the S&P 500 performance last year, unloved U.S. sectors should also benefit from rotation.
Martin Schulz, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, said he went overweight international developed markets already last autumn, betting on a broad global economic recovery. ""The cyclicality of the European markets, the Japanese markets... we think are going to be the big beneficiaries of this near-term globalized upturn."" CHEAP EUROPE
Almost $6 billion fled U.S. equities in the week to Jan. 19, while Europe and emerging market funds absorbed $2.7 billion and $5.2 billion respectively, according to BofA. Morgan Stanley strategist Graham Secker also cited internal data showing $5 billion outflows from U.S. exchange traded equity funds (ETFs), while those focused on U.S. domestic equities shed $8.5 billion. European stock ETFs gained $3.6 billion.
""We are detecting it qualitatively from investors around the globe, to shift a bit of weight from the U.S. to elsewhere,"" said Secker. Monday's rout https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-volatile-markets-fed-uncertainty-add-to-u.s.-dip-buyers-risks rippled out globally, as European shares plunged 4% for their worst day since mid-2020 and emerging equities shed 2%. Yet they may be relatively better positioned to cope with tighter policy.
Europe trades at a 27% discount to Wall Street, compared to an average 15% discount before the previous three Fed cycles, Goldman Sachs estimates. And value shares overall are 50% cheaper than growth peers, double the discount seen before past rate rises. Europe is also delivering more positive economic data surprises and upward earnings revisions than the United States, Secker noted.
EMERGING MARKETS TOO All markets will feel it when central banks slow the flow of cash, and depending on what the Fed does, the net supply of cash https://www.reuters.com/business/central-banks-start-turning-off-cash-taps-2022-01-13 from the four big central banks may even shrink for the first time in years.
But this cycle differs in one respect from its last one; China https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-rates/china-caps-weekly-policy-easing-blitz-with-fresh-rate-cuts-idUSKBN2JV06J, which hiked rates in 2018 alongside the United States, is now easing policy to support its economy. Easier Chinese policy will benefit other emerging economies and export-focused Europe via trade and commodity prices and could spell a 10% upside for Asian shares in 2022, JPMorgan wrote.
Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management in New Jersey, remains bullish U.S. stocks but reckons other markets may soon start to shine as well. ""Perhaps they will start to experience some of the growth that we have seen in U.S. markets over the last three years,"" he added.

7,Federal Reserve decision,2022-01-26T14:04:43Z,"The central bank, which has held short-term interest rates at near-zero since March 2020, is not anticipated to raise interest rates at the conclusion of Wednesday's meeting.","The Federal Reserve is expected to provide an update on its approach to high inflation today at 2 p.m. ET.
The central bank, which has held short-term interest rates at near zero since March 2020, is not anticipated to raise interest rates at the conclusion of Wednesday's meeting. Instead, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will more likely tee up the first post-crisis interest rate increase for the next policy-setting meeting in March.
The reason: the Fed needs to end its pandemic-era policy of buying U.S. Treasuries and agency-mortgage backed securities in the open market, a process which should be finished by mid-March. The Fed balance sheet, where those asset purchases live, has ballooned to nearly $9 trillion.
Still, market volatility and the overarching concerns about high inflation readings — unseen in almost 40 years — mean heightened attention to the Fed statement and the Powell press conference that will follow.
His commentary could solidify — or reposition — Fed watcher predictions for how many rate hikes to expect through the remainder of this year. Currently, Fed funds futures contracts appear to be pricing in the strongest likelihood of four total rate hikes (25 basis points each, for a total of 1.00%) by the end of 2022.
The statement from the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will be released at 2 p.m. ET followed by Chairman Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

8,David Rosenberg: The Fed will hike rates this year - but this is what’s going to be the bigger surprise,2022-01-26T13:57:02Z,A primer on the U.S. Federal Reserve,"Globe editors have posted this research report with permission of Rosenberg Research. This should not be construed as an endorsement of the report’s recommendations. For more on The Globe’s disclaimers please read here. The following is excerpted from the report:
There are too many rate hikes priced in, but the big deal is the end of QE and the onset of QT [Quantitative Tightening]. Farewell to the “wealth effect” on spending).
You look at the correlations and they say a lot. When it comes to the balance sheet, it has 90% correlation to the stock market but less than a 50% correlation to GDP. You go to the funds rate, it has only a 25% dampening effect on the stock market but an 80% negative impact on the real economy.
So what I’d be looking for now that the Fed has got the market reset for 4 rate hikes this year (and it is going to start in March, of that there is little doubt because Biden has already given a nod and all the FOMC doves are on board) is that the bigger surprise will be a quicker taper and quicker move to QT, and that is because it is the most efficient way to cool demand without crushing it. But the real damage is going to be for risk assets, and when you read the minutes from all the meetings of the past year, it is clear that the Fed is at least as concerned over asset bubbles as much as it is concerned that we have hit the wall on labor supply. And, in fact, one of the basic supporting mechanisms for this “Great Resignation” theme is this ingrained belief that people don’t have to go back to work because of their bloated portfolios.
Creating the conditions for a new and lower range for the equity market is going to suit the Fed just fine, and the Fed is a big believer in the equity and housing wealth effect on spending and that this runs in both directions.

9,Investor angst over interest rate hikes haunts markets as Federal Reserve meets,2022-01-26T12:54:13Z,Some on Wall Street are worried that the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is seen delivering remarks on a screen as a trader works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, on Dec. 15, 2021.ANDREW KELLY/Reuters
Wild volatility in the stock market this week has put heightened scrutiny on the Federal Reserve’s meeting Wednesday and whether the Fed will clarify just how fast it plans to tighten credit and potentially slow the economy.
With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signal that it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession. To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March. And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds.
Investors fear there may be still more to come. Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate. There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect.
Another wild card – particularly for Wall Street – is the Fed’s bond holdings. As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120-billion a month. The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed’s December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature – a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases. Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago.
The impact of reducing the Fed’s bond stockpile isn’t well known. But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018. The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20 per cent in three months.
If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent, up from near zero. The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing – from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit – more expensive. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession.
Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly. The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday’s trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent. Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10 per cent – the level that investors define as a “correction.”
Economists have forecast that when the Fed does start allowing some of its $8.8-trillion in bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet, it will do so at a pace of $100-billion a month. By not replacing some securities, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries. This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive.
Yet some analysts say they aren’t sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates.
“There is a fair bit of uncertainty about what to expect,” said Michael Hanson, global economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, said that Wall Street has also been unnerved by the sharp jump in the inflation-adjusted interest rate on the 10-year Treasury. That rate has jumped by one-half a percentage point just this month, an unusually swift rise.
All of which means Powell will face a delicate and even risky balancing act at his news conference Wednesday.
“It’s a threading-the-needle story,” Goldberg said. “They want to continue to sound hawkish – just not so hawkish as to create extreme market volatility.”
If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans. Modest drops in share prices, though, won’t likely affect its plans.
“The Fed does not at all mind seeing a repricing of risk here but would want to see it in an orderly fashion,” said Ellen Gaske, lead economist at PGIM Fixed Income, a global asset manager.
Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation. Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively. They argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn’t slow inflation in any case. In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure.
This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation – consumer prices have surged 7 per cent in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades – but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections.
Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary. The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages – to apartment rents, for example – which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely.

10,"GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. stock futures bounce ahead of Fed, oil gains on Russia-Ukraine",2022-01-26T12:27:22Z,"U.S. stock index futures rallied on Wednesday ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting, with rate hikes this year already priced in, while oil rose towards recent seven-year highs on tension between Russia and Ukraine.","U.S. stock index futures rallied on Wednesday ahead of the outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting, with rate hikes this year already priced in, while oil rose towards recent seven-year highs on tension between Russia and Ukraine. The Fed is due to update its policy plan at 1900 GMT after a two-day meeting. A first rate increase is seen in March, and three more quarter-point increases are expected by year-end.
U.S. S&P futures jumped 1.34%, indicating a stronger open on Wall Street, after the S&P 500 index lost 1.22% in the previous session. Nasdaq futures rose 2% after Microsoft Corp jumped in pre-market trading, as the tech giant forecast revenue for the current quarter broadly ahead of Wall Street targets. .
The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.28% on Tuesday. The MSCI world index rose 0.35%, European shares climbed 1.97% and Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.71%.
""There was some froth in markets, particularly in the U.S. and particularly in tech and some of that air has come out,"" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. ""I don't think this is a dead cat bounce -- we are nowhere near recession by any measure.""
U.S. stocks posted their worst week since 2020 last week. The MSCI index is also on course for its biggest monthly drop since the COVID-19 pandemic hit markets in March 2020, though analysts at Goldman Sachs said equities had not reached ""danger zone"" levels. Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said that given the recent volatility, he expected the Fed would be ""far more cautious about the timing and pace of the balance sheet reduction and that will be welcomed by the equity market"".
The Fed's balance sheet roughly doubled in size during the pandemic to nearly $9 trillion, as it snapped up bonds to help keep longer-term interest rates down to support the economy. But this has led to rising inflation, excessive leverage, and high valuations in certain segments of the stock market.
Growing tension as Russian troops massed on Ukraine's border have added to a risk-averse environment for investors. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he would consider personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin if Russia invaded Ukraine, as Western leaders stepped up military preparations and made plans to shield Europe from a possible energy supply shock.
Brent crude rose 0.61% to $88.81 per barrel. It reached $89.50 on Jan 20, the highest since October 2014. U.S. crude rose 0.4% to $85.95 a barrel.
Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco, said that if there was an invasion, ""the ensuing sanctions against Russia could drive up the price of oil, which in turn could add to inflationary pressures in the short run"". However, Ukraine and Russia's government bonds rallied, with political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany due to hold talks in Paris. Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine's president, tweeted on his arrival in Paris that it was ""a strong signal of readiness for a peaceful settlement"".
The dollar index edged up to 96.09 against a basket of major currencies, while the euro fell 0.2% to $1.1277, near one-month lows set on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar strengthened around 0.5% to 1.2568 versus the dollar. Odds are split on whether or not the Bank of Canada will raise rates for the first time since 2018 on Wednesday, with Omicron seen potentially delaying the start of an aggressive tightening campaign aimed at taming inflation.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries was 1.7886%, off a two-year high of 1.9% hit last week. German 10-year government bond yields were little changed at -0.072%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, after sharp losses earlier in the week which have left the index off 2.8% this year. Japan's Nikkei closed down 0.44%, after hitting its lowest since December 2020.
China's blue-chip index hit its lowest since October 2020 before backing up to close 0.72% higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.19%. Gold prices ticked down to $1,845 per ounce, after hitting a 10-week high in the previous session.

Microsoft Corp gained 3.9% premarket after the Windows maker forecast revenue for the current quarter broadly ahead of Wall Street targets, driven in part by its Intelligent Cloud unit. Texas Instruments Inc rose 4.6% after the chipmaker forecast upbeat current-quarter revenue and said it would sharpen its focus on chips used in the lucrative automotive and industrial sectors.
The strong outlook from both the companies lifted tech-related stocks with Meta Platforms, Apple Inc , Google-owner Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com , Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia Corp rising between 2.1% and 3.7%. The rate-sensitive tech and growth stocks have been roiled over fears of aggressive Fed action to combat inflation. Rising geopolitical tensions around Russia and Ukraine added to investors' woes, with the S&P 500 index flirting with a correction twice this week.
The policy decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), where the U.S. central bank is likely to signal the start of an interest rate hike cycle beginning March. The announcement will be followed by Fed chairman Jerome Powell's news conference, which will be parsed for clues on the magnitude and pace of hikes for the year and strategy for shrinking its roughly $9 trillion balance sheet.
Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a 25 basis point hike in March, in addition to three more rate increases by the end of the year. ""There is a greater chance we meet a confident, yet a comforting Fed,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
""The Fed hasn't got anything to gain in sending out hawkish messages today: slaughtered equity markets won't help them to get the inflation situation straight."" The benchmark index is now down nearly 9.2% from its record closing peak on Jan. 3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 13.5% so far this year.
At 6:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 386 points, or 1.13%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 67.5 points, or 1.55%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 319.25 points, or 2.26%. The fourth-quarter reporting season is in full stride, with 79 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 81% have delivered better-than-expected results, according to Refinitiv.
Tesla Inc added 4.3% ahead of its quarterly results after market close, while Boeing and Intel Corp also climbed in the run-up to earnings later in the day. AT&T Inc rose 1.7% after it beat market estimates for quarterly revenue on strong wireless and streaming demand.
Shares of all major Wall Street lenders gained more than 1% each.

12,"Federal Reserve meets to curb inflation, spooking markets",2022-01-26T12:08:00Z,"The past two days have been a roller coaster on Wall Street, plunging, recovering and dropping again ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve about inflation.","In the two days ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting, U.S. markets were especially volatile; Monday had at one point the biggest slide since the pandemic began.
WASHINGTON — Wild volatility in the stock market this week has put heightened scrutiny on the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday and whether the Fed will clarify just how fast it plans to tighten credit and potentially slow the economy.
With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signal that it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession. To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March. And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds.
Investors fear there may be still more to come. Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate. There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect.
Another wild card — particularly for Wall Street — is the Fed’s bond holdings. As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120 billion a month. The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed's December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases. Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago.
The impact of reducing the Fed's bond stockpile isn't well known. But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018. The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20% in three months.
If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, up from near zero. The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — more expensive. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession.
Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly. The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday's trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2%. Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10% — the level that investors define as a “correction.”
Economists have forecast that when the Fed does start allowing some of its $8.8 trillion in bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet, it will do so at a pace of $100 billion a month. By not replacing some securities, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries. This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive.
Yet some analysts say they aren't sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates.
“There is a fair bit of uncertainty about what to expect,” said Michael Hanson, global economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, said that Wall Street has also been unnerved by the sharp jump in the inflation-adjusted interest rate on the 10-year Treasury. That rate has jumped by one-half a percentage point just this month, an unusually swift rise.
All of which means Powell will face a delicate and even risky balancing act at his news conference Wednesday.
“It’s a threading-the-needle story,"" Goldberg said. ""They want to continue to sound hawkish — just not so hawkish as to create extreme market volatility.”
If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans. Modest drops in share prices, though, won't likely affect its plans.
“The Fed does not at all mind seeing a repricing of risk here but would want to see it in an orderly fashion,"" said Ellen Gaske, lead economist at PGIM Fixed Income, a global asset manager.
Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation. Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively. They argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn’t slow inflation in any case. In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure.

That follows $4.9 billion of withdrawals last week, highest since August.","Foreigners are cutting and running in some key Asian emerging markets amid turbulent trading ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers are expected to signal an interest-rate liftoff in March.
Overseas funds have sold a net $3.1 billion worth of shares in Taiwan, South Korea and India so far this week, according to the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. That follows $4.9 billion of withdrawals last week, the largest since August.
“Coupled with the rise in geopolitical risks (Russia – Ukraine) that may keep energy costs high in the near term, risks are fairly high for now and it’s not surprising to see money being taken off the table,” said Lorraine Tan, director of Asia equity research at Morningstar.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has lost more than 5% in two weeks, as rising bets on faster-than-expected monetary tightening and heightened tensions over Ukraine roiled global stock markets. Benchmarks in Taiwan and Korea have suffered with their large tech exposure, with the sector bearing the brunt of the selloff as bond yields rose.
“Foreign investors seem to have started reducing risky assets as they gauge the Fed’s monetary tightening,” said Hyun Choi, head of equity at Baring Asset Management Korea Ltd. “Investors need time to get adjusted to the new environment of change in liquidity.”
Some Southeast Asian markets that have relatively low exposure to tech names have bucked the trend of outflows. Foreigners have been net buyers in small amounts in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam so far this week.
In India, where the benchmark stock gauge slumped the most in two months on Monday, consumer technology names were among the biggest losers.
“The high intensity of selling in the market appears like forced liquidation by large foreign investors,” Abhay Agarwal, fund manager at Mumbai-based Piper Serica Advisors Pvt., said on the day. –Bloomberg

Global shares steadied after sharp losses earlier this week as investors awaited any hints about faster tightening of monetary policy from the Fed later in the day. The FTSE 100 has gained 1.3% so far this year, significantly outperforming a 4.4% drop in the wider European stock aggregate , helped by cheap valuations, strong banking and energy gains and a lower exposure to technology stocks.

""UK stocks have everything in its favor right now with strong commodity prices and the higher interest rate environment only to provide added support,"" Temperton said. Britain's Pets At Home jumped 4.8% after pet supplies retailer raised its profit outlook for fiscal 2022.
Hungary-based carrier Wizz Air added 3.2% even after it posted a third-quarter operating loss and said the fourth quarter loss was likely to be slightly higher, before an expected improvement in spring. Gambling software maker Playtech fell 3.6% and was the top loser on the mid-cap index after it once again backed a buyout by Aristocrat Leisure, following a report that the London-listed company was exploring a breakup if the deal does not go through.

MSCI's index of emerging shares was up 0.1% after a three-day rout over which it lost about 3.6%. An index of Asian shares was flat, torn between losses in Taiwan and South Korea, and gains in China mainland and Hong Kong tech ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.
Main indexes in Russia, South Africa, Poland and Saudi Arabia all rose 0.6% and 2%. Currencies of the developing world made small moves, as did the dollar, as investors awaited more clarity from the Fed amid speculation that its first interest hike of the year could be brought forward to the meeting ending on Wednesday.
While a 25 basis point March rate hike is priced in, investors are seeking clarity on the magnitude, pace and number of hikes for the year as inflation surges. The decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT). ""Fed President Jerome Powell will probably try and get out of providing concrete statements on the rate cycle at this point of time so that they can take a decision based on the data over the coming months,"" said Antje Praefcke, FX and EM analyst at Commerzbank.
Higher U.S. rates dent the appeal for riskier emerging market assets, especially those with high external debt. Currencies see narrowing interest rate differentials which keep them attractive for carry trade. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut 2022 world economic growth forecast, highlighting that the Fed tightening could delay Asia's recovery.
But foreign investors are piling into China at the start of 2022, seeing it as a haven from the inflation, growth and pandemic problems plaguing most other markets. The IMF also warned that a Russia-Ukraine military conflict would keep inflation higher for longer via increased energy and commodity costs.
The United States and UK said they could consider imposing personal sanctions on Putin if Russia were to invade Ukraine. Moscow launched a fresh set of navy drills to rehearse protecting Arctic shipping lane, while it continues a troop build-up near Ukraine. Russia's rouble swung between small losses and gains to Tuesday's close, while Ukraine's hryvnia slipped to four-year lows of 28.83 per dollar.

18,Pros and cons of another ‘Fed put’,2022-01-26T08:26:24Z,"If the US Federal Reserve ends its long-standing policy of underwriting asset prices, there could be a stimulus withdrawal equivalent to the $US5 trillion Japanese economy.","His strategy worked through the 1990s but backfired badly with the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000.
Following that market crash, Greenspan switched his central bank support to buying US mortgages.
That fuelled a mortgage securities boom that went bust with the global financial crisis in 2008-09, which, in turn, prompted then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to implement his version of the “Greenspan put”.
Since then, US central bank support of asset prices, in particular equity markets, has become entrenched in the system and been implemented by successive Fed chairs, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell.
The policy has been especially good for America’s largest banks, which have earned record profits since 2008-09, private equity companies that have ridden high on cheap debt, and the 1 per cent of the US population that owns about a third of the country’s wealth.

But the asset price inflation party is now on rocky ground.
With the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure running about 4.8 per cent – or double the rate experienced in the past decade – Powell is looking to raise official interest rates and wind back quantitative easing.
Many in the market, including Jeremy Grantham and The Australian Financial Review’s Christopher Joye, smell an end to the Fed put and the possibility sharemarkets will tank by 50 per cent.
But Powell’s options for removing the put are limited, according to Viktor Shvets, Macquarie’s equity strategist based in New York.
Shvets says the Fed and other central banks don’t have much room in a “financialised” and leveraged world, which is not ready for the removal of fiscal and monetary supports.

He says the primary mandate of central banks is not employment or inflation; it is maintaining the stability of the “cloud of finance”, which is five to 10 times larger than underlying economies.
“The Fed’s responsibility is to balance asset values that belong to the top 5 per cent, with the need to stimulate borrowing and consumption by the bottom 60 per cent [who own almost nothing], while keeping the diminishing middle relatively intact, without having all the required tools,” he says.
“The Fed is not an arbiter but rather a ‘market’s mirror’, with investors watching the Fed and the Fed watching investors, understanding that modern economies require rolling asset bubbles to sustain what the ‘cloud of finance’ demands and societies view as appropriate growth rates.”
Expansionary fiscal policies
Shvets says that if the Fed wants to keep inflation “boiling” to benefit US households, it will have to maintain highly expansionary fiscal policies, supported by an accommodative monetary stance.
The alternative is a fiscal cliff of enormous proportions.
Advertisement
Using data from the International Monetary Fund, Shvets says the fiscal deficits in the US, Japan, eurozone and Britain will fall from 11 per cent of GDP in 2021 to a range between 5 and 6 per cent in 2023.
The absolute deficits are projected to fall from $US5 trillion ($7 trillion) in 2021 to $US2.6 trillion in 2022 and $US2.1 trillion in 2023.
“In other words, investors are likely to witness around $US3 trillion of fiscal deficits removed over the next 18 months or so,” Shvets says.
“At the same time, as fiscal policies are becoming more stringent, monetary policies are also turning the corner, and equally as aggressively.”
Shvets says the withdrawal of support for the “cloud of finance” over the next 18 months could be extraordinary if central banks raise official interest rates and stop using their balance sheets to prop up asset prices.
He says the central banks of the US, Japan, UK and eurozone pumped about $US8 trillion into financial markets in 2020 and another $US2.3 trillion last year.

“It seems likely, therefore, that at the very least, central banks would remove probably more than $US2 trillion, and potentially $US3 trillion, from global liquidity,” he says.
“Hence, we continue to anticipate that, for G4 economies (US, UK, Japan and eurozone), the combination of fiscal and monetary tightening might be equivalent to withdrawing up to $US5 trillion to $US6 trillion of supports in a relatively short 18-month window.
Transitory inflation spike
“This is larger than the size of Japan’s GDP.”
Shvets believes the inflation spike in the US is transitory, and it is a mistake to quote annual inflation numbers.
“It is true that the inflationary spike was both stronger and more elongated than either economists or policymakers were anticipating,” he says.

“However, to quote annual numbers is meaningless, and on month-to-month or three months-to-three months – inflationary measures have already peaked.
“There is a lot less inflation in the eurozone, China and Japan, while Anglo-Saxons are more inflationary because goods demand rebounded a lot more there than in the rest of the world.
“Goods demand is running around 20 per cent above trend line in the US, while services demand is running at least 10 per cent below trend line.
“Assuming that we progress from pandemic to endemic, goods demand will ease and services will improve, while supply of goods is already getting better – just look at ISM and other indices.
Limited wages growth
“The same applies to labour markets. There is absolutely no evidence that inflation is moving into wages in the eurozone, China and Japan, and even in the US it is still mostly impacting disrupted sectors.
Advertisement
“At the same time, labour participation in the US remains low, and there is at least another 3 million and possibly up to 8 million people who can enter the labour force.
“If you think of consumer surveys, yes, immediate inflation expectations are high, but they come off over time, and neither 20- nor 30-year bond yields in the US signal any inflationary concerns – they’re stuck at just above 2 per cent.
“In other words, bond markets are telling you that longer-term, they expect neither inflation nor growth. The same is true of five year-five year break evens, which remain anchored around 2 per cent.”
Shvets says it is a mistake to look at economies as being disconnected from asset prices and market volatility.
“The Fed’s mandate is not inflation or employment but ensuring that the inverted debt and wealth pyramid does not collapse, because if it does, it will massively derate both growth and inflation.”
The arguments against the Fed put staying in place were put succinctly this week by economists at Nomura International Securities in New York – Aichi Amemiya, Robert Dent and Kenny Lee.

First, they said broad financial conditions remain accommodative and the Fed’s primary objective was to “normalise policy over coming months to ensure high inflation does not become entrenched, making a Fed put far less likely”.
Second, the Fed wants to tighten conditions and is happy for its hawkish pivot to be priced into financial markets. This is happening, as shown by the spike in 30-year residential mortgages in the US from 3.1 per cent in December to 3.5 per cent in January.
Third, several Federal Open Market Committee members have commented negatively on the elevated price-to-earnings ratios and sharemarket valuations.
Fourth, excess savings, which are estimated at $US2.5 trillion, can be used to offset any wealth effect from falling share prices.
Finally, the tightening in financial conditions before any rise in official interest rates may prompt the Fed to slow its course and reduce the likelihood of four rate increases in 2022.
“While financial conditions play a role in the overall economic outlook, their ability to create another Fed put similar to what occurred over 2011-19 remains far more limited,” the Nomura economists said.",https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/pros-and-cons-of-another-fed-put-20220126-p59rey

Microsoft's impressive second quarter results failed to prevent its shares falling more than 3% in after-hours trading on Wall Street.
Revenues rose 20% to $51.7 billion (£38.3 billion) and operating profit lifted 24% to $22.2 billion (£16.4 billion), despite a 17.5% increase in R&D spending and other operating cost rises.
Intelligent Cloud operating profit lifted over 26% to reach $8.2 billion (£6.1 billion), driven by demand for Azure and other cloud services as divisional revenue climbed 26% to $18.3 billion (£13.5 billion).
The results, which sent shares down 3.7% in after-hours trading, came a week after Microsoft unveiled a deal worth $68.7 billion (£50.9 billion) to buy gaming developer Activision Blizzard .
Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Almost $52 billion in quarterly revenues is a number that’s simply hard to wrap your head around, but such is Microsoft’s importance to workplaces, homes and schools across the globe.

Moscow has denied it is planning an assault, but it has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine in recent weeks and is holding military drills at multiple locations in Russia. That has led the United States and its NATO allies to rush to prepare for a possible war.

With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signalthat it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession. To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March. And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds.

Investors fear there may be still more to come. Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate. There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect.
Another wild card — particularly for Wall Street — is the Fed’s bond holdings. As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120 billion a month. The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed's December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases. Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago.
The impact of reducing the Fed's bond stockpile isn't well known. But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018. The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20% in three months.
If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, up from near zero. The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — more expensive. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession.
Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly. The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday's trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2%. Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10% — the level that investors define as a “correction.”
Economists have forecast that when the Fed does start allowing some of its $8.8 trillion in bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet, it will do so at a pace of $100 billion a month. By not replacing some securities, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries. This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive.
Yet some analysts say they aren't sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates.
“There is a fair bit of uncertainty about what to expect,” said Michael Hanson, global economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, said that Wall Street has also been unnerved by the sharp jump in the inflation-adjusted interest rate on the 10-year Treasury. That rate has jumped by one-half a percentage point just this month, an unusually swift rise.
All of which means Powell will face a delicate and even risky balancing act at his news conference Wednesday.
“It’s a threading-the-needle story,"" Goldberg said. ""They want to continue to sound hawkish — just not so hawkish as to create extreme market volatility.”
If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans. Modest drops in share prices, though, won't likely affect its plans.
“The Fed does not at all mind seeing a repricing of risk here but would want to see it in an orderly fashion,"" said Ellen Gaske, lead economist at PGIM Fixed Income, a global asset manager.
Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation. Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively. They argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn’t slow inflation in any case. In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure.
This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation — consumer prices have surged 7% in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades — but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections.
Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary. The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages — to apartment rents, for example — which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely.",https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/fed-meets-investor-angst-over-rate-hikes-spooks-markets/2623749/

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it plans to begin raising its benchmark interest rate as soon as March, a key step in reversing its pandemic-era low-rate policies that have fueled hiring and growth but also escalated inflation.
With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses and unemployment falling steadily, the Fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases, which have been intended to lower longer-term rates, in March.
The Fed’s actions are sure to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — costlier over time. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow consumer spending and hiring. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates could trigger another recession.

The central bank’s latest policy statement follows dizzying gyrations in the stock market as investors have been gripped by fear and uncertainty over just how fast and far the Fed will go to reverse its low-rate policies, which have nurtured the economy and the markets for years. The broad S&P 500 index fell nearly 10% this month before rebounding slightly Wednesday.
High inflation has also become a serious political threat to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, with Republicans pointing to rising prices as one of their principal lines of attack as they look toward the November elections.
Yet Biden said last week that it was “appropriate” for Chair Jerome Powell to adjust the Fed’s policies. And congressional Republicans have endorsed Powell’s plans to raise rates, providing the Fed with rare bipartisan support for tightening credit.
A separate potential source of higher rates is the Fed’s plans for its bond holdings, which are at a record high of nearly $9 trillion. The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, have been intended to reduce longer-term interest rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors also saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed’s December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than merely ending its purchases. The impact of the reducing the Fed’s bond stockpile isn’t well known. But the last time that the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018.

The world's most important central bank is expected to leave interest rates on hold, but signal that it intends to hike them in March, for the first time since 2018.
Analysts said Powell is also likely to confirm that the central bank's bond purchases will end in March.
Yet his statement could trigger more volatility in markets if the Fed comes across as more ""hawkish"" — that is, keen to raise interest rates faster and harder — in its approach to inflation.

Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will rely primarily on letting bond holdings run off the balance sheet as they mature, rather than selling bonds outright, as it seeks to trim its massive portfolio, the central bank said on Wednesday.
""The Committee intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA),"" the Fed said in principles released at the end of the central bank's two-day policy-setting meeting. read more
Fed officials also said they expect they will begin reducing the central bank's balance sheet after they start raising interest rates.

And the Fed said it intends to hold mainly Treasury securities in the longer run, reducing its footprint on other types of credit.
The Fed's nearly $9 trillion portfolio had doubled in size during the pandemic as the central bank snapped up Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to support markets and the economy. Policymakers are now crafting a plan for reducing those holdings, but Fed officials will need to tread carefully as they shrink their holdings. read more
""The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,"" the Fed said in a statement.

29,Explainer: How low can the Fed's balance sheet go? Here's what officials will be watching,2022-01-26T05:00:00Z,"As the Federal Reserve gears up to cull its bond holdings sooner and faster than it has previously, officials say a new tool, combined with lessons from the past, should help smooth the process and avoid the market upheaval its earlier effort ultimately triggered.","Jan 26 (Reuters) - As the Federal Reserve gears up to cull its bond holdings sooner and faster than it has previously, officials say a new tool, combined with lessons from the past, should help smooth the process and avoid the market upheaval its earlier effort ultimately triggered.
Still, Fed leaders will have to tread carefully as they figure out how much they can realistically shrink their roughly $9 trillion portfolio, and some analysts believe they will need to employ more aggressive measures than last time. It's a critical question facing the Fed as it looks to right-size its asset holdings, which roughly doubled in less than two years as it amassed Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help lower borrowing costs and cushion the economy and markets from the coronavirus pandemic. read more
With unemployment back to near pre-pandemic levels and inflation running very high, officials say the same amount of support is no longer needed. But it is unclear how small the balance sheet will get. As officials feel their way down to a smaller balance sheet, they will need to keep a close eye on markets, and the economy, to know if they've gone too far.

WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
The last time officials tried to reduce their bond holdings, from the end of 2017 to autumn 2019, they only managed to shrink the balance sheet by about 15% or so before they ran into trouble. That was because the level of reserves, or deposits that banks hold with the Fed, got too low, which led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs in September 2019.
Officials are more ambitious this time, with some eyeing a level below where it was before the global health crisis began in early 2020 - a reduction of greater than 50%. But some economists say it's not yet clear whether the Fed will be able to get that far, or if it can go even lower thanks to other central bank facilities now in place.
Reuters Graphics
NEW TOOL COULD HELP
A new tool set up last year, known as the standing repo facility, can serve as a backstop for banks in need of cash and may help to prevent another surge in short-term rates. Financial firms could instead borrow from the facility if they are running low on reserves.
But analysts and economists say it will only work if banks feel they won't be criticized for turning to the Fed for the temporary cash loans. Bill Nelson, chief economist at the Bank Policy Institute and a former Fed economist, compared the new program to the discount window, the long-standing emergency lending outlet many banks are reluctant to use because they don't want to be viewed as being at risk.
With the SRF in place, some firms should feel more comfortable holding Treasury securities with the understanding that ""if they needed to, they could convert them to cash,"" Nelson said. But that depends on the Fed making it clear that using the facility is a ""normal course of business,"" he said.
EXTRA CASH 'SLOSHING' AROUND
Over the past year, financial firms have been dealing with too much cash - a trend that is evident in the high popularity of another Fed tool that lets firms park cash with the central bank overnight. Usage of the program, known as the reverse repo facility, has averaged $1.5 trillion a night over the past three months.
That suggests the Fed can probably afford to reduce its balance sheet by at least that much before it starts to encounter scarcity issues, says Tiffany Wilding, a PIMCO economist and a former analyst at the New York Fed. ""There’s more money sloshing around in the system now than banks want,"" Wilding said. But usage of the reverse repo program may not go straight down as the Fed shrinks its holdings, said Nelson, so officials will need to move carefully.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
WILL THE FED HAVE TO SELL BONDS OUTRIGHT?
That's a big unknown, and while Fed officials have not ruled anything out, they've generally shied from discussion of actively selling assets rather than allowing the reduction to occur passively by letting bonds roll off the portfolio as they mature. It's not clear that the portfolio's maturity schedule will allow the Fed to shrink its holdings as fast as some would like, however.
Some analysts, like Zoltan Pozsar at Credit Suisse, argue that the Fed may be pressed into bond sales this time because of the size of the inflation threat, the run-up in risky assets during the Fed's quantitative easing phase and a flattening Treasury yield curve.
This time, ""outright asset sales, if inflation, exuberance, or a curve inversion so dictate, are not at all unlikely,"" Pozsar wrote in a report.
Reuters Graphics
HOW WILL THEY KNOW THEY'VE GONE TOO LOW?
The balance sheet levels seen before the pandemic may not be a good gauge for how low holdings can get this time around. One factor is that ""banks' demand for reserves varies over time,"" Lorie Logan, an executive vice president in the Markets Group of the New York Fed, said earlier this month during an interview with the Macro Musings podcast.
To figure out if reserves are falling too low, the Fed will keep an eye on money markets, Logan said. As she and other New York Fed officials explained in a recent blog post, the relationship between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), or the Fed's main target rate, and the interest rate that the Fed pays on reserve balances (IORB) is important.
The two rates trade further apart when reserves are abundant, as they were between 2013 and 2014. And the rates trade closer together when reserve balances are declining, as they were between 2017 and 2019.

Balanced current accounts, largely lower inflationary pressures and the stability provided by the resilient Chinese yuan to regional currencies have ensured that most Asian central banks have not been pressured to pursue interest rate hikes as aggressively as their peers in Europe and Latin America.
However, Fed tightening is putting pressure on some central banks in Asia to follow suit, potentially hurting their equity markets as happened in 2013 when the U.S. central bank began tapering its post financial crisis stimulus.
""The recent central bank actions in Asia suggest that they may want to prepare for a Fed that is more hawkish than currently expected,"" said Frances Cheung, Rates Strategist at OCBC Bank.
""The pre-emptive tightening provides them with some flexibility to quicken their own tightening paths if there is any upside surprises from the Fed.""

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo
Jan 26 (Reuters) - The watchword the last time Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell oversaw a rate-hiking cycle was ""gradual.""
This time will be different.
""We are going to need to be, as I’ve mentioned, nimble about this. The economy is quite different this time,"" Powell said on Wednesday following the Fed's January policy-setting meeting at which it signaled its first interest rate hikes of the COVID-19 era would likely start in March. And from there on, it's pretty much anyone's guess.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
""Powell put a kibosh on any type of 'measured/gradual' guidance, because the economic outlook is much too uncertain,"" Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons wrote in a note titled: ""FOMC Signals A Guidance-Light Tightening Cycle.""
For starters, inflation is far higher and the economy and labor markets are much stronger than when the Fed undertook its last set of rate rises in the previous decade, Powell said.
Then, from December 2015 to 2018, the Fed never left less than three months between rate hikes, and never raised the target rate more than a quarter-of-a-percentage-point at a time.
The policy path, Powell and other Fed policymakers promised repeatedly during that period, would be gradual. And once the Fed began shrinking its balance sheet to further tighten policy, two years after it began raising rates, it promised to do so at the pace that paint dries.
Today, inflation is near a 40-year high and the unemployment rate, at 3.9%, is within touching distance of the Fed's goal of maximum employment.
""As we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this a very different expansion...Those differences are likely to be reflected in the policy that we implement,"" said Powell, who used the word ""nimble"" at least three times.
Powell didn't detail exactly what those differences would be, and in fact, asked directly if the Fed could be expected to raise rates in bigger intervals or was otherwise departing from its 'gradual' script, said policymakers hadn't yet broached those questions.
""We will begin to address them as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that,"" he said. ""We fully appreciate that this is a different situation.""
In December Fed policymakers had signaled they could raise rates three times this year, but since then the inflation picture has, if anything, deteriorated, Powell said.
On the possibility of more than four rate hikes this year, ""he didn’t say they wouldn’t,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, ""which indicates a flexibility to raise rates much more quickly (if necessary) than anyone was expecting.”
Others were more succinct, ""Today the Fed interest rate rocket left the hangar,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings.
""No more Mr Nice Guy,"" wrote Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.
Interest rate futures markets have bought fully into a faster trajectory, with the pricing there now reflecting better than even odds of five hikes of a quarter point each this year.
Powell repeatedly emphasized that the Fed's primary job now was to bring down inflation closer to its 2% goal. Improving, if far from fully fixed, supply chains would help, as would the lack of any new fiscal stimulus in the works.
But rather than assuage concerns that the Fed might become quite aggressive as it seeks to tamp down inflation, Powell pointed to the different reality this time.
""What we need here is another long expansion...that's going to require price stability. That's going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2% goal,"" Powell said.

By taking some steam out of the economy, the Fed hopes to ease the pressure on prices, making staples such as food, energy, and housing easier to afford.
What the Fed did: Officials said “ it will soon be appropriate” to begin increasing rates. This was widely expected because consumer prices are climbing at the fastest pace since the early 1980s.
Federal Reserve officials just wrapped up their first monetary policy meeting of the year. The focus of the two days of deliberations was how to get inflation under control. Here are the key points from the statement the Fed released Wednesday at the end of the meeting.

Until then, officials are leaving the range for their benchmark interest rate at 0 to 0.25 percent, where it has been since the pandemic hit in early March 2020. The Fed likes to give financial markets plenty of notice when rates are going to change.
What the Fed didn’t do: Officials didn’t specify how quickly or how high they expect to boost rates. Analysts say that the Fed will probably start boosting rates at its next meeting, scheduled for March 15-16. They expect three or four 0.25 percentage point increases this year.
Where things stand: Two main factors are responsible for soaring consumer prices: Supply chain disruptions caused by COVID, and the extraordinary amount of stimulus money Congress delivered to American households.
Fed officials can’t fix the supply problems, but they can drain money from the economy to prevent it from overheating.
The central banks has nearly wound down its massive purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The buying program was initiated early in the pandemic to keep money coursing through financial markets. That extra support for the economy is no longer needed. The Fed said it will reduce its purchases next month and end them in March.

In a separate statement, the Fed said it expects to begin reducing its holdings “after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun.”

Key Facts
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1%, over 300 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.7%. Stocks jumped to their highs of the day—with the S&P 500 up as much as 2%—as investors were initially reassured by the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it plans to raise interest rates three times this year beginning in March. Despite rising shortly after the Fed’s announcement, stocks turned negative as investors were alarmed by a separate statement from the central bank about “reducing the size” of its massive balance sheet after raising interest rates. Treasury yields jumped—also adding pressure on stocks—after Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference that there was “quite a bit of room” to further raise interest rates before harming the labor market. The Fed also confirmed that it will still end its pandemic-era asset purchases by March, as it looks to continue tightening monetary policy given the recent “progress” the U.S. economy has made. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, gained nearly 5% after a strong quarterly earnings report helped boost markets and provided some much needed relief to beaten down tech stocks, which rebounded Wednesday.

“With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” Fed officials said in a statement.
Key Background:
Stocks have swung wildly so far this week, with the S&P 500 briefly falling into correction territory—at one point 10% below its record high—as market volatility surged. The index is now on track for one of its worst starts to a year ever. Amid the wider selloff in tech stocks, the Nasdaq was the first index to hit correction territory last week, currently around 14% below its record highs last November.
Tangent:
Despite a recent surge in market volatility, most experts believe the added uncertainty for investors won’t deter the central bank from sticking to its forecast for interest rate hikes in 2022. “It’s premature to assume the latest volatility and weakness, in and of itself, will cause the Fed to blink (e.g., adjust the narrative),” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab, in a recent note.
What To Watch For:
Despite the somewhat “dovish” statement from the Fed, stimulus withdrawal is going to “remain a headwind” for markets over the next several quarters, predicts Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli. While investors hadn’t been expecting the central bank to announce any major policy changes, concerns about more hawkish policy and the removal of pandemic-era stimulus have been rampant, dragging markets lower so far in 2022.

The Federal Reserve boss is likely on Wednesday to signal that interest rates will start rising in March to curb inflation. The robust U.S. economy can cope with that, as well as the three other hikes that investors expect him to deliver before the end of this year, but perhaps not too much more.
Powell has for months been dogged by criticisms that the central bank is late in acting to rein in inflation, which is at a four-decade high of 7% read more . He and other rate-setters have, however, increasingly clearly signalled that policy will be tightened soon. Investors have already moved on. Asset price gyrations over the past week are partly due to concerns that the Fed will have to deliver more rate rises this year than policymakers had previously anticipated to tackle price pressures.
The Fed rate-setting committee’s median expectation in December was for three quarter-point hikes in 2022. Investors think rates could rise by more than that. Money market prices imply that there’s a two-thirds probability of the target range for the federal funds rate rising to at least 1% to 1.25% by the end of the year, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.

If so, the economy can cope. GDP growth will slow from last year’s red-hot pace but is still going to be strong: The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday forecast expansion of 4% this year. And the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in December, not too far off from the 3.5% level recorded in February 2020, just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.
Hiking the policy rate by much more than a percentage point this year would, however, be risky given the uncertain path of the pandemic. A World Health Organization official said this week she expected the next variant of Covid-19 would be more transmissible than Omicron, which put a dampener on jobs growth last month. Powell’s challenge will be to do enough to rein in inflation while leaving himself scope to deal with any potential economic hiccups.

But many reckon markets may have found a temporary bottom.
Goldman Sachs told clients the falls did not indicate a ""danger zone"" had been reached and that its risk indicator models suggest markets are nearing levels that are considered good entry points for longer-term investors. read more
Citibank too advised investors to consider buying into market dips. Based on a series of 18 metrics it said the number of ""red flags"" on U.S. markets was far lower than before the 2008 crisis and the bursting of the dotcom bubble.
Below are some more indicators signalling conditions for a bounce:
1/OVERSOLD TERRITORY
Chartists have been watching the relative strength index (RSI) to gauge oversold conditions for U.S. indices after this month's ructions. A level below 30 is traditionally seen as indicating a selloff has gone too far and pointing to a short-term bounce.
All three major U.S. benchmarks are trading below that level, and the Nasdaq 100 (.NDX) - which has shed $3 trillion in market value this year - fell all the way to the lowest since December 2018 at 25.4.
""U.S. markets are now looking oversold. I sense a rally,"" one UK-based trader said.

2/EXTREME BEARISHNESS
The latest sentiment survey by American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) showed retail investors in an extremely bearish mood; considered a classic contrarian signal, the indicator is hovering near its lowest in almost three years.
AAII
3/TAKING PROFITS FROM SHORTS
Net short positioning across U.S. benchmarks also points to a near-term bounce, potentially triggered by investors locking in profits from successful bearish bets.
While the S&P (.SPX) has switched from net long to net short, Nasdaq positioning remains net short and according to Citi, the most ""negatively extended"".
Recent selling was more sentiment-driven than linked to new macro data, the bank said, adding that Nasdaq futures positioning was a ""one-sided short with profit levels rapidly rising which could lead to a short-term rebound.""
Overall, the futures flows picture implied ""weak conviction,"" they added.

4/FRENZIED PUTS
The frenzied rush for the exits is also visible in the options markets. The CBOE put-to-call ratio has hit its highest since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, signalling investors may be getting too pessimistic in the short term. Put options confer the right to sell at a pre-agreed price and calls allow holders to buy.

Stocks got an upbeat start to trading Wednesday after two days of breathtaking volatility, as investors await the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of 2022.

The meeting will set the tone for a critical year of Federal Reserve policy, one that is likely to be among the most hawkish in recent memory according to Danielle DiMartino Booth, chief executive and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence. Recent market swings are unlikely to divert the Fed from the rate hikes and balance sheet reduction strategy it has been telegraphing for months, Booth said Wednesday in comments emailed to The Washington Post.
""The Fed is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils,"" Booth said, between implementing necessary policy measures that will bring down surging inflation, and risking limiting business activity and taking money out of an already-slowing economy. ""Inflation is the Federal Reserve's biggest worry right now.""
Some measure of certainty will arrive for Wall Street later Wednesday afternoon, when the central bank will release a policy statement. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also hold a news conference regarding the central bank’s plans.
Sentiments were also higher in overseas trading Wednesday, with European indices registering healthy gains across the board, led by France’s CAC40, which climbed 2.4 percent. Asian markets also closed broadly positive, with the exception of Japan’s Nikkei 225, which declined around .4 percent.

Oil prices continued their upward march, boosted by steady production and the ongoing threats and possible ramifications of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, climbed more than 1.5 percent to around $88.50 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, rose more than 1.5 percent to trade roughly $87 per barrel.
Investors are pricing in the risks the conflict presents to an already embattled sector, which also has been shaken by a recent series of missile strikes in the Middle East and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.
""It's still unlikely that oil and gas will be used as a weapon any time soon, but if it was, it could lead to a serious surge in prices given how tight the markets are,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst with OANDA, said Wednesday in comments emailed to The Post.
On Tuesday, the Biden administration confirmed that it was trying to secure energy for European allies in case Russia cuts off oil and gas exports in response to sanctions imposed for an invasion of Ukraine, according to reporting from CNBC.
""If Russia decides to weaponize its supply of natural gas or crude oil, it wouldn't be without consequences to the Russian economy,"" a second senior administration official told the news outlet.
Meanwhile, the grind of earnings season continues, with Tesla and Intel scheduled to report after the market close. Boeing’s shares rose 2 percent in early trading after the aviation giant reported it generated positive cash flow last quarter for the first time since 2019.

NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Laser-focused on how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in tightening policy, some U.S. investors and strategists are starting to worry about what may seem a distant threat: a sharp economic slowdown or even the next recession.
Investors have been unnerved in recent days about the potential for a more hawkish Fed than previously expected. Some are concerned an aggressive interest-rate-hiking cycle, combined with a reversal of the U.S. central bank's bond-buying program, could cause too sharp a slowdown.
A hawkish stance by the Fed, which concludes its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, has pushed up short-term rates, flattening the closely followed yield curve on U.S. Treasuries.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
""I am intently focused on the yield curve,"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors. ""The only way the Fed can bring down inflation is to slow demand, ... and in doing so it risks causing a recession or a sharp slowdown in growth. This dynamic is causing the yield curve to flatten and increasing strain in risk markets more broadly.""
The yield curve between 2-year and 10-year notes flattened to less than 75 basis points on Tuesday, the smallest gap since Dec. 28.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields retrenched this week as stocks tumbled, which was partly seen as a flight to safety but gave a measure of the delicate tightrope the Fed faces as it plans to start draining pandemic stimulus liquidity from the markets to fight surging inflation.
""The markets seem to be pricing concern about a localized, relatively short-term inflationary problem that results in Fed action that is ultimately damaging to the economy,"" said Michael de Pass, global head of U.S. government bond trading at Citadel Securities.
David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said last week in a research note that Fed tightening could lead to a correction in financial markets, though he said if this were to result in a U.S. recession it would be ""shallow and short-lived.""
The fears may seem distant as the economy has been regaining speed. According to a Reuters survey of economists, growth in 2021 could come in at 5.6%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.4% in 2020. read more
Gary Black, manager of the Future Fund Active ETF, said while just four to six weeks ago people ""were worrying about too much growth,"" they are now ""worried that they're nearing the R word,"" pointing to the move in the small-cap Russell 2000 index, which fell more than 20% from its record closing high on Nov. 8, before it reversed to move higher.
""That's the schizophrenic nature of this market,"" said Black.
Tobias Adrian, director of the International Monetary Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said while there was some talk in the market about recession due to the yield curve's flattening, it was not expected.
""We are expecting growth continues, slowing in coming years but positive,"" Adrian said. The IMF on Tuesday lowered its economic forecasts for the United States, China and the global economy. read more
NORMALIZATION?
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, warned last week of the risk of a possible curve inversion in case of a fast pace of monetary policy adjustment by the Fed to curb inflation. read more
The last time the yield curve went negative, which historically has been an indicator that a recession will follow in one to two years, was in 2019. The coronavirus-driven U.S. recession lasted only two months, ending with a low point in April 2020.
Still, some investors said the rally in U.S. Treasuries over the past few days was a normalization after yields spiked too quickly since the beginning of the year, and that economic data do not point to an impending risk of recession.
""The market got ahead of itself and started pricing in a very aggressive Fed, and the curve flattened out a lot sooner than it would in prior cycles,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Societe Generale.
For Guneet Dhingra, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley, the curve flattening has been exacerbated by demand from pension funds on the back end of the curve.
""I don't worry about the recession fear, based on the recent curve flattening. I do think it's more a function of technicals than fundamentals,"" he said.

""Market sentiment remains fragile,"" said TD Securities strategists, noting that any hints 'around the starting point for QT or 'sooner' and 'faster' on hikes could be market-moving.""
But they added that they didn't expect definitive signals and the result could be mixed messages.
Money markets are currently priced for a first hike in March, followed by three more quarter-point increases by year-end.
The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, edged 0.06% higher to 96.030, after climbing to 96.273 on Tuesday, its strongest level since Jan. 7. It has rallied as much as 1.74% from a two-month low touched on Jan. 14.
""I think the Fed will acknowledge that a March hike is likely, and then key is if they'll indicate a faster pace of hikes and also an earlier end to tapering than they've signalled so far,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist at Barclays. ""If it turns out to be more hawkish then obviously the dollar will benefit.""
On the simmering tensions around Ukraine, he said: ""until that is solved, there should be demand for safe haven currencies, so I think the yen should remain bid.""
Elsewhere, sterling was little changed at $1.3503 after dipping to $1.3436 overnight, its lowest in more than three weeks.
In addition to jitters over Ukraine and the Fed, sterling is contending with political uncertainty at home, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under investigation for possible COVID-19 lockdown breaches. The findings of an internal inquiry could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to media reports. read more
The Canadian dollar strengthened to CAD$1.26075 per greenback, recovering from a drop to CAD$1.2702 at the start of the week, its weakest level since Jan. 7.
""There is a huge amount of uncertainty around the January Bank of Canada rate announcement, as policymakers attempt to balance very strong realized data on employment and inflation from Q4 versus the sharp increase in COVID infections and subsequent lockdowns in late December and January,"" TD Securities analysts wrote.
""Ultimately, we think it makes more sense for the BoC to lift rates.""
The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was little changed at $0.71555, consolidating after sliding to a one-month low of $0.70905 on Monday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets next week, and traders are anxious to see if blowout inflation numbers released Tuesday will force Governor Philip Lowe to backtrack on his previous insistence that rate hikes this year are extremely unlikely.
Australian stock and bond markets are shut on Wednesday for a holiday.
The yuan touched a near four-year high against the dollar as Chinese authorities appeared to be taking a more tolerant of view of the currency's strength, at least for now.
Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint at 6.3246 yuan per dollar, the firmest since April 2018. Onshore spot yuan strengthened to a high of 6.3201, also the strongest since April 2018.

Balanced current accounts, largely lower inflationary pressures and the stability provided by the resilient Chinese yuan to regional currencies have ensured that most Asian central banks have not been pressured to pursue interest rate hikes as aggressively as their peers in Europe and Latin America.
However, Fed tightening is putting pressure on some central banks in Asia to follow suit, potentially hurting their equity markets, similar to what happened in 2013 when the U.S. central bank began tapering its post financial crisis stimulus.
""The recent central bank actions in Asia suggest that they may want to prepare for a Fed that is more hawkish than currently expected,"" said Frances Cheung, rates strategist at OCBC Bank.
""The pre-emptive tightening provides them with some flexibility to quicken their own tightening paths if there is any upside surprises from the Fed.""

The euro was about flat at $1.1303 after dipping to $1.1264 overnight for the first time since Dec. 21.,"The euro hovered near its weakest in a month versus the safe-haven dollar and yen on Wednesday as traders fretted over a potential military conflict in Ukraine and the possibility of accelerated Federal Reserve policy tightening.
The euro was about flat at $1.1303 after dipping to $1.1264 overnight for the first time since Dec. 21. It slipped 0.06% to 128.64 yen, after touching 128.25 in the previous session, also a first since Dec. 21. Western leaders stepped up preparations for any Russian military action in Ukraine while Moscow said it was watching with great concern after 8,500 U.S. troops were put on alert to deploy to Europe in the event of an escalation.
Meanwhile, the Fed ends a two-day policy meeting later in the global day, with market players anxiously awaiting further clues on the timing and pace of interest rate hikes, as well as how the central bank will go about slimming down its almost $9 trillion balance sheet, a process dubbed quantitative tightening (QT). Money markets are currently priced for a first hike in March, followed by three more quarter-point increases by year-end.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, was flat at 95.973, after climbing to 96.273 on Tuesday, the highest since Jan. 7. It has climbed as much as 1.74% from a two-month low touched on Jan. 14. ""Market sentiment remains fragile,"" TD Securities strategists wrote in a client note.
From the Fed, ""any hints around the starting point for QT or 'sooner' and 'faster' on hikes could be market-moving,"" but ""we don't expect definitive signals, unfortunately, and the result could be mixed messages,"" they wrote. Elsewhere, sterling was little changed at $1.35095 after dipping to a more than three-week low of $1.3436 overnight. In addition to jitters over Ukraine and the Fed, sterling is contending with political uncertainty at home, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under investigation for possible COVID-19 lockdown breaches.
The findings of an internal inquiry could be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to media reports. The Canadian dollar edged up to CAD$1.2622 per greenback ahead of a Bank of Canada policy decision later in the day. The currency has recovered after dropping to CAD$1.2702 at the start of the week for the first time since Jan. 7.
""There is a huge amount of uncertainty around the January Bank of Canada rate announcement, as policymakers attempt to balance very strong realized data on employment and inflation from Q4 versus the sharp increase in COVID infections and subsequent lockdowns in late December and January,"" TD Securities analysts wrote. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar was little changed at $0.71555, consolidating after sliding to a one-month low of $0.70905 on Monday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets next week, and traders are anxious to see if blowout inflation numbers released Tuesday force Governor Philip Lowe to backtrack on his previous insistence that rate hikes this year are extremely unlikely. Australian stock and bond markets are shut on Wednesday for a holiday.

WASHINGTON – Wild volatility in the stock market this week has put heightened scrutiny on the Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday and whether the Fed will clarify just how fast it plans to tighten credit and potentially slow the economy.
With high inflation squeezing consumers and businesses, the Fed is expected to signal that it will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate in March in a dramatic reversal from the ultra-low-rate policies it imposed during the pandemic recession. To further tighten credit, the Fed also plans to end its monthly bond purchases in March. And later this year, it may start reducing its huge stockpile of Treasury and mortgage bonds.
Investors fear there may be still more to come. Some on Wall Street worry that on Wednesday, the Fed may signal a forthcoming half-point increase in its key rate. There is also concern that at a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell could suggest that the central bank will raise rates more times this year than the four hikes most economists expect.

Another wild card — particularly for Wall Street — is the Fed’s bond holdings. As recently as September, those holdings were growing by $120 billion a month. The bond purchases, which the Fed financed by creating money, were intended to reduce longer-term rates to spur borrowing and spending. Many investors saw the bond buying as helping fuel stock market gains by pouring cash into the financial system.
Earlier this month, minutes of the Fed's December meeting revealed that the central bank was considering reducing its bond holdings by not replacing bonds that mature — a more aggressive step than just ending the purchases. Analysts now forecast that the Fed could begin shrinking its holding as early as July, much sooner than was expected even a few months ago.
The impact of reducing the Fed's bond stockpile isn't well known. But the last time the Fed raised rates and reduced its balance sheet simultaneously was in 2018. The S&P 500 stock index tumbled 20% in three months.

If, as expected, the Fed raises its key rate in March by a quarter-point, it would lift the rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%, up from near zero. The Fed’s moves are likely to make a wide range of borrowing — from mortgages and credit cards to auto loans and corporate credit — more expensive. Those higher borrowing costs, in turn, could slow spending and weaken corporate profits. The gravest risk is that the Fed’s abandonment of low rates, which have nurtured the economy and the financial markets for years, could trigger another recession.
Those worries have sent stock prices fluctuating wildly. The Dow Jones average plunged more than 1,000 points during Monday's trading session before recovering and finishing with a modest gain. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 closed down 1.2%. Steady declines since the start of the year have left the S&P down nearly 10% — the level that investors define as a “correction.”

Economists have forecast that when the Fed does start allowing some of its $8.8 trillion in bond holdings to roll off its balance sheet, it will do so at a pace of $100 billion a month. By not replacing some securities, the Fed in effect reduces demand for Treasuries. This raises their yields and makes borrowing more expensive.
Yet some analysts say they aren't sure how big the impact on interest rates will be or how much the Fed will rely on reducing its balance sheet to affect interest rates.
“There is a fair bit of uncertainty about what to expect,” said Michael Hanson, global economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, said that Wall Street has also been unnerved by the sharp jump in the inflation-adjusted interest rate on the 10-year Treasury. That rate has jumped by one-half a percentage point just this month, an unusually swift rise.
All of which means Powell will face a delicate and even risky balancing act at his news conference Wednesday.

“It’s a threading-the-needle story,"" Goldberg said. ""They want to continue to sound hawkish — just not so hawkish as to create extreme market volatility.”
If the stock market is engulfed by more chaotic declines, economists say, the Fed might decide to delay some of its credit-tightening plans. Modest drops in share prices, though, won't likely affect its plans.
“The Fed does not at all mind seeing a repricing of risk here but would want to see it in an orderly fashion,"" said Ellen Gaske, lead economist at PGIM Fixed Income, a global asset manager.
Some economists have expressed concern that the Fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation. Others say they worry that the Fed may act too aggressively. They argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn’t slow inflation in any case. In this view, high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the Fed’s rate hikes are powerless to cure.

This week’s Fed meeting comes against the backdrop of not only high inflation — consumer prices have surged 7% in the past year, the fastest pace in nearly four decades — but also an economy gripped by another wave of COVID-19 infections.
Powell has acknowledged that he failed to foresee the persistence of high inflation, having long expressed the belief that it would prove temporary. The inflation spike has broadened to areas beyond those that were affected by supply shortages — to apartment rents, for example — which suggests it could endure even after goods and parts flow more freely.",https://www.clickondetroit.com/business/2022/01/26/as-fed-meets-investor-angst-over-rate-hikes-spooks-markets/
50,US stocks slide after Fed signals interest rates will rise ‘soon’,2022-01-26T00:00:00Z,An early market rally on Wall Street gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields after the Federal Reserve signalled it plans to begin raising interest rates “soon” to fight a spike in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse.,"An early market rally on Wall Street gave way to a broad slide for stocks and a surge in bond yields after the Federal Reserve signalled it plans to begin raising interest rates “soon” to fight a spike in inflation that the central bank says is probably getting worse.
The S&P 500 fell 0.1% after having been up 2.2% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% after swinging more than 900 points from its high for the day. The Nasdaq ended little changed, shedding most of a 3.4% gain.
Bond yields rose, including the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which climbed to 1.87% from 1.78% late on Tuesday. Yields affect rates on mortgages and other consumer loans.
In a statement issued after its latest policy meeting, the Fed said it “expects it will soon be appropriate” to raise rates.
Since the December meeting, I’d say the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse Jerome Powell
Such a move is expected to happen as soon as March, as half the Fed’s policymakers have expressed a willingness to raise rates by then.
The Fed also said it would phase out its monthly bond purchases, which have been intended to lower longer-term rates, in March.
The major stock indexes initially rose after the release of the Fed statement, but shed most of their gains as Fed chairman Jerome Powell took repeated questions about how and when the central bank will start letting its balance sheet shrink after buying trillions of dollars of bonds through the pandemic.
The selling accelerated as Mr Powell acknowledged that the high inflation slamming the economy is not getting better, which could force the Fed to get even more aggressive about raising interest rates and removing the support it put in pace for markets.
“Since the December meeting, I’d say the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse,” he said. “It hasn’t gotten better. It’s probably gotten just a bit worse, and that’s been the pattern.”
Mr Powell also said that there is room to raise interest rates without hurting the labour market, and would not rule out the possibility that it could raise short-term interest rates at any one of its meetings this year or raise by a larger-than-usual amount at any one.
Those comments sent a signal to Wall Street that the Fed may be more hawkish when it comes to tackling inflation, said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts.
“In the market’s mind, that’s more rate hikes, and while he was clear to say that the economy is strong enough to handle those rate hikes, from a strictly (stock) market perspective, higher rates weigh on expensive stocks,” Mr Delwiche said.
The S&P slipped 6.52 points to 4,349.93. The Dow fell 129.64 points to 34,168.09. The Nasdaq rose 2.82 points to 13,542.12. The indexes are all on pace for weekly losses.",https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/us-stocks-slide-after-fed-signals-interest-rates-will-rise-soon-41282312.html
