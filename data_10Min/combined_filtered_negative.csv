2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:40:00," Good afternoon. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero and maintained our asset purchases. These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete. Wide spread vaccinations, along with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades. Each of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounce back in activity from depressed levels. The sector's most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have shown improvement. Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by the ongoing reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions. The housing sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace. In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity. Forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our March summary of economic projections. Even so, the recovery is incomplete and risks to the economic outlook remain. As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven. It rose 419,000 per month on average in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains. Employment in this sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8%, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth. These factors should weigh in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations leading to more rapid gains in employment. Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.5% at the end of this year, and declining to 3.5% by the end of 2023. The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit. In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans and Hispanics. The population has increased notably in recent months. The 12-month change in PCE prices was 3.6% in April, and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Part of the increase reflects the very low readings from early in the pandemic falling out of the calculation, as well as the past through of past increases in oil prices to consumer energy prices. Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in spending, as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have limited how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term. These bottleneck effects have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation notably for this year. As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from 3.4% this year to 2.1% next year and 2.2% in 2023. The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the onset of the pandemic. As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and bottlenecks, hiring difficulties and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect. Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum employment goal. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 2%. If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term inflation expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we'd be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy. The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook. Vaccinations on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID-19, and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk. Continued progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal economic conditions. The Fed's policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system. As the committee reiterated in today's policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2%, we will aim to achieve inflation materially above 2% for some time so that inflation averages 2% over time, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved. With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0-1-quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2%, and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years from now. More important than any forecast is the fact that whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly accommodative. Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer requires holding rates near zero. In addition, we are continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals. The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy. At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the committee had a discussion on the progress made toward our goals since the committee adopted its asset purchase guidance last December. While reaching the standard of substantial further progress is still a ways off, participants expect that progress will continue. In coming meetings, the committee will continue to assess the economy's progress toward our goals. As we have said, we will provide advanced notice before announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases. On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve's administered rates. The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by five basis points in order to keep the Federal Funds Rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets. This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the Federal Funds Rate or stance of monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Michelle and Helen. Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023. I'm curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with child care perhaps they retired early, any barriers that you see keeping people from the labor market as you consider a full employment going into 2023. Thank you. Thank you. I would say if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it's clear and I am confident that",-0.0011030850798847,0.0028762955215365,18,2021-06-16,True,False,False,False,-0.0053411481105097,Negative,Negative,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT      June 16, 2021

2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:40:00,2021-06-16 18:50:00," path to a very strong labor market, a labor market that shows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum. I mean, I think that's shown in our projections, it's shown in outside projections. And if you look through the current timeframe, you think one and two years out, we're going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market. In terms of exactly what that means, we'll have to see how things evolve. I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend. And I have no reason to think that that won't happen again. At the same time, we have seen, in terms of participation, we've seen a significant number of people retire. And so we don't actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward. But I would tend to look at it and think that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that. But overall, this is going to be a very strong labor market. In terms of the near term, you ask as well. So we see a couple of things, a few things, that seem likely to be holding back labor supply. There are very large amounts of job openings in there, very large number of people who are unemployed. And the pace of filling those jobs is somehow feel slower than it might be. So I'd point to a number of things. The first of which is just that most of the act of sort of going back to one's old job, that's kind of already happened. So this is a question of people finding a new job. And that's just a process that takes longer. There may be something of a speed limit on it. You've got to find a job where your skills match what the employer wants. It's got to be in the right area. There's just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job. So that's sort of a natural thing. In addition, I would say that we look at, for example, significant number of people still say that they're concerned about going back to work in jobs, where there's a lot of public facing because of COVID. So that's clearly holding back some people. And that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead. There's also the question of childcare. Many are engaged in caretaking. And as schools reopen and childcare centers open in the fall, then we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers. Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into the fall by the end of September. And that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs. So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well. So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into the fall. I will also say, though, the last thing I'll say is this is an extraordinarily unusual time. And we really don't have a template or any experience of a situation like this. And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data. It's not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy. We need to see more data. We need to be a little bit patient. And I do think, though, that we'll be seeing some things coming up and coming once that we'll inform our thinking. Thank you, Paul Kearnin. Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. Your, the Canadian medium forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty pain outlook for the rest of the year. And as you know, the three month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4% in the CPI. And I'm just wondering, sort of, how much longer we can sustain those kinds of rates before you get nervous. Thanks. So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you'll see that the incoming data are consistent with the view that prices, the prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. So the, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is elustered as this. The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like. They should stop going up. And at some point they, in some case, you should actually go down and we did see that in the case of lumber. Another example where we haven't seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Use car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It's going up at just an amazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop and then in fact it would reverse over time. So we think we'll be saying some of that. When will we be saying it? We're not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct though, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the timing of that is pretty uncertain. And so are the effects in the near term. But over time, it seems likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be, will be temporary. And we'll be wanting, you know, we're going to be looking, we'll be looking at the monthly pricing data. I'll also say that the labor market is going to be important both for the maximum employment goal, but also for inflation. And we'll be looking at that. And as I mentioned, what we expect. And I expect that we'll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply. Abate, Wayne, move down. So I can't give you an exact number or exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down. If you look at the forecast for 2021 and sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the on the federal open market committee, you'll see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the full range of inflation projections for 2023, it falls between 2 and 2.3%, which is consistent with our goals. Thank you. Now we'll go to Elon Moui at CNBC. Hi, thank you, Sherpael for doing this. My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you're making toward your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases. In that discussion, you said that you didn't have a major substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress in that discussion. Did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases? I expect it will be able to say more about timing as we see more data. There's not a lot more light I can shed on that. But you can think of this meeting that we had as the talking about talking about meeting, if you like. And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has served its purpose well, I think. So committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in December, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective and assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the committee will continue to assess the economy's progress toward our goals and will give advance notice before announcing any decision. The timing, of course, the line will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar. Thank you. Now we'll go to Chris Reggaver AP. Right. Thank you. Well, you mentioned, let me ask about inflation expectations. You said they were. I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them is within target. Does that mean that some of the shorter term measures we've seen out there, such as the New York Federal Reserve's three year outlook, which jumped a bitch. Should those sort of be dismissed? And are we only looked at looking at longer term inflation expectations? And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point? And on a related note, with the Fed, consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis. Thank you. So we do tend to look at the longer term inflation expectations, because that's really. We think what matters for inflation. So, and, and, you know, the shorter term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you'll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you'll see.",-0.0016623919445235,0.0029528027813497,19,2021-06-16,True,False,False,False,-0.0053411481105097,Negative,Negative,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT      June 16, 2021

 The new interest rate and economic projections will show just how much policymakers’ views have changed since March, when Fed officials at the median still projected the first interest rate increase would be delayed until at least 2024..U.S. job growth has been weaker than expected in the intervening weeks, but inflation has run hotter - a worst-of-both-worlds outcome that has forced the Fed to bank on recent price hikes proving “transitory,” and hiring to accelerate as the nation’s economic reopening continues..The economy may only be at the start of that journey, even with the recent jump in the Fed’s preferred inflation measure to 3.6%..“With the labor market lagging, no strong evidence that the Fed’s transitory inflation story is incorrect, and market pricing moving closer to the Fed’s views on inflation and the policy rate, the Committee should not yet feel compelled to send a hawkish signal through their rates guidance,” Luzzetti said..Advertisement
 With markets having priced in the start of those talks about tapering but unsure whether rising inflation will encourage more aggressive action from the Fed and other central banks, some caution has crept in..Key will be Fed members' projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023..No policy changes are expected, but Wall Street wants to know whether the Fed still thinks rising inflation is transitory and whether its latest view will lead to a sooner-than-expected rate hike and a tapering of its massive bond buying program..""I do think this impulse of inflation, although transitory, is going to be much higher than the Fed and market participants are expecting right now..I'm expecting some more hotter inflation data, but ultimately those pressures ease as we get into 2022."".""Unemployment, however, remains elevated, despite some 3.5 million people still absent from the labor force, compared to the pre-COVID level."".Stocks are hovering close to all-time highs with many developed economies moving toward ending lockdowns while central banks keep easy-money policies in place..Price gains have been coming in quicker than central bankers had expected when they last released economic projections in March, and that has invited questions about whether and when the Fed will need to begin removing its economic policy supports, which remain set to emergency mode..“There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty: how much of the inflation is being driven by transitory factors, like supply chain disruptions, and how much of the slower job growth is being driven by temporary measures like enhanced unemployment benefits,” he said in emailed comments..But like others, Ruesterholz expects the Fed to “strike a patient tone, wanting to ensure they do not overreact and slow the pace of recovery.”
 More data are ahead for Wednesday—building permits and housing starts and import prices for May..“However, we expect the Fed to signal that, if the economy continues to recover strongly, it will likely be appropriate to begin to discuss a plan for tapering the pace of asset purchases at some point in upcoming meetings.”
 Key will be Fed members’ projections, or dot plots, for interest rates and whether more now tip a hike in 2023..“Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,” said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness..""Investors are bullishly positioned for permanent growth, transitory inflation and a peaceful Fed taper via longs in commodities, cyclicals and financials,"" said BofA, suggesting the market was vulnerable to any hint of Fed hawkishness..""There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty: how much of the inflation is being driven by transitory factors, like supply chain disruptions, and how much of the slower job growth is being driven by temporary measures like enhanced unemployment benefits,"" Ruesterholz explained.",0.5464,"{

2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 18:50:00,2021-06-16 19:00:00," the shorter term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up. And that's maybe not a good signal for future inflation if gas happens to spike and then go back down again. So yes, I think if you look at the broad range of longer term inflation expectations, they have moved up, they moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins. So that was a concern. So it's good actually to see long term inflation expectations move back up to a range, it's a range that's consistent with what are objectives are. These are not precise measures and they contain risk premiums of various kinds and that's why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of indicators, which are from surveys of economists, surveys of the public and also market-based. It's a wide index, as I'm sure you know. We look at that and we see them back in the range where they were and by the way they've been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago. At a time when inflation was still anchored and at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below. So the answer is yes, I think they are anchored and they're at a good place right now. It's gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. As you know, it's fundamental in our framework, our new framework to assure that long term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal. We think that's an important reason if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that's consistent with your goal, it's not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term. So it's important. Okay, now we'll go to James Politi with the FT. Hi Powell. Hi, thanks, Tripowl. Your economic projections today forecast us 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment for 1.5 percent and core inflation of 3 percent. If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress in your mind? And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one, but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of can you describe the sort of tone of the discussion in the committee and are we really moving towards sort of a post pandemic stance? Is there greater confidence that the recovery will be a full recovery sooner than expected? On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the committee will make and it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not qualify. That is, you know, the process that we're beginning now at the next meeting, we will begin meeting by meeting to assess that progress and talk about what we think we're seeing and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases. In terms of the two hikes, so let me say a couple things, first of all, not for the first time about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They're not a committee forecast. They're not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriated any particular year because discussing liftoff now would be highly premature, it wouldn't make any sense. In our, if you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you'll see that sometimes people mention their rate path and their interventions often they don't. And the last thing to say is the dots are not a great forecaster of future rate moves and that's not because it's just because it's so highly uncertain. There is no great forecaster of future dots. So dots to be taken with a big grain of salt. However, so let me talk about this meeting. Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements, the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made. And it's outcome-based, it's not time-based. And as I mentioned, its labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation and 2 percent, and on track to exceed 2 percent. And the projections, they give some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case. And I honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants, many participants, are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the committee's forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals. So the other thing I'll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the committee. The focus of the committee is the current state of the economy, but in terms of our tools, it's about asset purchases. That's what we're thinking about. Lift off is well into the future. The conditions for lift off are very far from maximum employment. For example, it's a consideration for the future. So the near-term thing is really, the real-terms discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the path of asset purchases. And as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, at future meetings, continue to see you. Think about our progress. Thank you. We'll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. Well, I'll continue, Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you're ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that? So, our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent. And I can just tell you, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is, and we'll try to be clear. And as I mentioned, we'll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so, all I can say is that we think it's important. We think where the balance sheet's concerned, a lot of notice is much transparency as we can give, and as far as, as far in advance as we can, to give people a chance to adjust their expectations. And we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress, and then have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on time. It wouldn't be appropriate to say we're going to have to see more data. There are ways away from substantial further progress, we think. But we're making progress. You can't say generally how far in advance you would signal. Again, as we approach that goal, it will provide as much clarity as we can. Great. Thank you. Going to Craig Tours at Bloomberg. If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2% inflation. In other words, does the FOMC have a look back period, or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years? Because over the next three years, you're going to be above inflation. So what is your look back period? Does the committee have one? And if not, why not? And if they don't, why isn't this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2 and a quarter percent? Thanks. You know, we, so as part of our year and a half long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the new statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy, we look carefully at the idea. We've all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded in a, you know, I strongly agree that it's not wise to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that. So we did adopt a discretionary. There's an element of discretion in it. It says that we will seek to seek inflation that runs moderately above 2% for some time. And it's meant to create a broad sense that we won inflation to average 2% over time. But and that under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was 2% was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. You were always getting back to 2%. So you were bouncing back and forth between 1 and a half and 2. And we wanted them to be centered around 2. So that's, that's the approach that we're taking. You're right. It's not a formula like approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework. Was there another part of your question, Craig? Craig? That's pretty much answers it, Chair Powell.

2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 19:00:00,2021-06-16 19:10:00," Thank you. Now we'll go to Michael Derby. I'm particularly my question. So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage. And we've seen lately. I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility. And do you believe that the changes in the feds rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that. And then in a related question, do you think that fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets. So on the on the facility, we think it's doing its job. We think it's doing the reverse repo facility is is doing what it's supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its range. So we're not concerned with it. It's doing you have an unusual situation where the treasury general account is is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there's there's downward pressure. We're buying assets. There's downward pressure on short term rates. And that that facility is doing what we think it's supposed to do. Sorry. Your second question was again. Yeah, I mean change the rate control toolkit. Well, that have any impact on you think that will reduce the amount of money coming into reverse repose will that have any impact on money market conditions that you know beyond the fed funds rate setting. It could have some impact. I think we'll have to see empirically, but it's designed to keep the federal funds rate in in you know within the range and. I do think it could have some effect on on broader money market conditions below as it relates to you know the very low rates and the downward pressures. And will it will give me will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility or that's just not even really a focus of what the change was. It's not honestly and you know that the funny thing you would think that it would. But we'll have to see it's it's that they're it's possible that that that would not be the case. Well, that's going to be an empirical question. Thank you. I will go to Gina smell like the New York Times. Hey, Javier, thank you for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that as you mentioned it's pretty royal all the data is pretty been pretty royal by the pandemic and we're not really sure where E pop is going to settle in. And wages are already looking decent. So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and sort of how you're thinking about those wage data. Yeah, as you well know, there isn't one indicator we can look to and there's no one number that we can therefore point to we look at a range of indicators and it's a very broad range you can count to a high number just quickly. Certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that. So how do we think about it? A couple things. We're all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time. Now that was that hadn't happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle. So we're going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different it's a different economy. We we have had a slew of retirements and that may weigh on participation. That that effect though should wear off in a few years and and you know as as you move through that window because they would people would have retired anyway and you'll be back where you would have been. So I think we're I think the lesson number one is is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment and I think if you during the last cycle, there were there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, you know, as as 2012 when I arrived at the Fed and you know, you know, nine years later, eight years later, we were still creating jobs and and you know, it's quite remarkable. So we're all going to be informed by that at the same time we understand this is a different economy. You know the demographics are people are getting older and that should have a secular effect to of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what what can be done, but I think we're going to be we're going to lean into the optimistic. Yes, about wages, you know, we we're seeing wage increases that's that's sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy. And what we're seeing is that we don't see anything that's troubling in the sense of what would be troubling would be, you know, very what why it across the economy wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation. In other words, wages and excess of productivity and inflation, but you know, by meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage price cycle. That that that's the old formula for one of the old formulas for having high inflation. We don't see anything like that. Now we do see high wages. We see them for for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low skilled jobs. And but we do think you've got to you've got to think in the labor market right now where we're supply and demand or just not matched up well. And you know, we think it's a flexible economy and it will clear there will there will be a level at which supply and demand meet. And that'll that we think that'll that'll be happening in coming months. So, but the last thing I'll say is again, if you look at the forecast, we're going to be in a very strong labor market. Pretty quickly here. We there are still a big group of unemployed people. And you know, we're not going to forget about them. We're going to we're going to do everything we can to get people back into work and given the chance to work. But there's every reason to think that we'll be in in a labor market with very attractive numbers with low unemployment, high participation and rising wages across the spectrum. So that's that's a little bit how we're looking at the labor market. Thank you. Now we'll go to handling at the American banker. Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now is the fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth and deposits and you ultimately believe a permanent fixes needed and any information on the timing around that would be helpful. I can say is we're working on it. Don't have anything to share with you in terms of the particular or the timing right now, unfortunately, but we've always our position has been for a long time and it is now that we like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk based capital requirements. When leverage requirements are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower risk assets for high risk ones. It's a straightforward thing. And because of the substantial increase in reserves, treasuries and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become to ceasing to be the intended backstop for our big firms that we want to be. So we do think it's appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high reserves environment and we're looking hard at the issue. We would also just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements. Sorry, I can't give you anymore. That's just something we're working on. Thank you. Now we'll go to Anakin Tappa at CNN business. Either thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, the price gems we've seen and some raw materials lumber, for example, you mentioned earlier seem to be easing and it looks like we're in the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand. But I wonder if you were at all if we're going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages were off and if we just continue this mismatch as we're recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy and I wonder how that would affect the feds outlook at all. Well, that is really not the problem we're having right now, but and actually people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that because they know that you know they don't want to build build capacity and then find out that it's not necessary. So really the problem now is that demand is very, very strong. Incomes are high. People have money on their in the bank accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high and it hasn't hasn't come down. We're seeing the service sector reopening and so you're seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there. But in terms of over correcting I mean I think there is a possibility on the other side of this that that inflation could be could actually be quite low going forward but that's not that's not really where our focus is right now we're focused right now is we need to our expectation is that these these high inflation readings that we're seeing now will start to abate and that's that's what we think and it'll be like the lumber experience. And like we expect to use car experience.",0.0017193539972015,0.0023967157874753,21,2021-06-16,True,False,False,False,-0.0053411481105097,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT      June 16, 2021

 With U.S. inflation rising faster than expected and the economy forecast to grow at its quickest pace in decades this year, some policymakers have begun questioning whether the Fed should continue to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero and leave unchanged a massive bond-buying program put in place to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic..Any actual change in monetary policy is, as a result, likely months down the road as the Fed balances a variety of risks..Yet enough has changed in recent months - and may start to change at an even faster clip - that analysts expect the Fed to at least acknowledge the start of policy discussions that will eventually lead to a plan to first reduce the monthly $120 billion in bond purchases to zero and then start raising interest rates..:

We expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there's no reason to think that they're going to keep going up a lot, because if they are, people will build new hotels. There's no reason for supply and demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time. So, we think that will happen. I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there's a lot of uncertainty. The overall story is one that we think is right, and we think the incoming data supported, and so do many, many forecasters. If you look at the forecast on the FOMC, you will see that as well. But, we don't in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that this goes on longer than expected, and the risk would be that over time. It does begin to affect inflation expectations. If we see inflation expectations and inflation or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn't hesitate to use our tools to address that. That's a price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that. We do not expect that, though. That is not our base case, and in that we're joined by many other forecasters. But there's a lot to be humble about among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It's highly uncertain business, and we're very much attuned to the risks and watching the data carefully. In the meantime, I would say we should, as I mentioned earlier, there's so much uncertainty around this. It's just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider at Voiders. Howard Schneider-Roters, thanks, Chair Powell for taking this. I want to miss the moment here, and I just noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy. So is this the effective end in your view of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it's still cited as a risk? You know, it's a continuum, right? What you've seen with the pandemic is sharply declining, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and that's great. Either that should continue. You've also saw in the United Kingdom, which, as I think at least as high, if not higher vaccination rates, they've had an outbreak of the Delta variety, and it's causing them to have to react to that. So you're not out of the woods at this point, and it would be premature to, in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory. Vaccination has a ways to go to get to levels. It would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And that can only help. So look, you're right. The statement language is evolving. I would expect it to continue to evolve. There's a lot of judgment in that, but you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that's what you do with statement language. It's great to see the progress, but again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. Who doesn't want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated. If I could follow up on that, if you view this statement in Toto and the dots and the steps as well, do you think this is more of a mark to mark an exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there? I think it's both. I think clearly, since March, what's happened is people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes that they'll be achieved. Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved. There's more grounds for comfort. We've seen growth come in higher than we expected. We've seen very strong labor demand. We've also seen, we have seen inflation above target, though. And I think, even though in our forecaster's case, they do see inflation coming back down over 22 and 23 into areas that are very consistent with our mandate. Nonetheless, the risk is something that can factor into people's thinking about appropriate monetary policy. The thing is, these are 18 different forecasts. And I can't stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people's minds. That is something that I think can factor into things as well. Dr. Interfore, our forecast as well. Thank you. Thank you. We'll go to Victoria Guida with Politico. Hi, Chair Powell. I want to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you're thinking about this. So in the projections, inflation is expected to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again enough for a lift off in 2023. I know that's obviously, you know, take that with the grain of salt, but that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2%. And so I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation? What would be, because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn't caused by trans-usory factors in the next couple of years. So would that be the result of a tight labor market? Would that be because this full situation is raised, people's inflation expectations? How are you thinking about that? So what we're seeing in the near term, again, our base case is that what we're seeing in the near term is principally associated with the reopening of the economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints really. So but you're right, when you get to, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adapted, you know, flexible economy, more so than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, you know, rising resource utilization or to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment or high employment is the way to think about it. So that's what that's about. That's about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion, tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. That's why, and that's why you would see it then because by then, you know, in the forecast, and it's just a forecast, they're just individual forecasts in people's forecasts, that's what's happening. So it's so it's so that the change of the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation. Yeah, I think there may be an element of the latter as well because inflation expectations have continued to move up. It's in, you know, it's all in people's individual thinking and it can't, it's hard to say it's not something that committee debates in terms of, you know, what the outlook is for 2023. So I'm a little bit speculating which I shouldn't do, but I wouldn't surprise me if there's an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we've had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2% that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought. And then inflation expectations may move up to a level, they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2%. They might move up as a consequence of this or as a consequence of the new framework. You know, we did see inflation expectations moving up in the wake of the announcement of the framework, but you know, we don't really know that. So ultimately, I think it's consistent with both of those things. Thank you. Now we'll go to Greg Robb at Market Watch. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I'm just looking at the forecast and the one thing I just don't think it's been talked about all that much is how much you got the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year. I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year as with higher inflation? And what do you think about that? We're looking at an economy that will not have the degree of fiscal support, the fiscal support in the forecasts is much less than it was this year. But you've still got a very strong growth well above the longer run potential output of the economy. You've got growth meaningfully above that. And inflation is lower next year and all of our forecasts. I think the range of core PCE forecasts for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you're right. You're seeing, I can't remember the number, but it might be in the threes, 3.3 and a half percent growth for next year. That's a really good year. Coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that's a really good year. That's a year with a lot of momentum. That'll see, you know, that'll cause significant job creation.",0.0018442671464759,0.0019651947436959,22,2021-06-16,True,False,False,False,-0.0053411481105097,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT      June 16, 2021

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation 
 
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
 stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on June 16, 
 2021: 
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to set the 
 
 interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective 
 June 17, 2021..Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 
 15 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is 
 intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the Federal 
 Open Market Committee’s target range and to support the smooth functioning of 
 short-term funding markets..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to 
 authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
 York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market 
 Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 
 
 “Effective June 17, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk 
 to: 
 
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal 
 funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent..o Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional 
 amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 
 (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these 
 securities..o Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and

2021-06-16 18:30:00,2021-06-16 19:20:00,2021-06-16 19:30:00," I mean, we would take three and a half percent. We didn't have a three and a half percent growth year. We didn't have a three percent growth year between the global financial crisis and the end of the expansion. So that will be a good year. Doesn't it seem like there's a risk of, like, stagnation where that, you're gonna go from seven percent and down, that means the economy's really dissolling, dropping. And so we haven't seen that, right? Well, it's, the economy's not, not, dec... The economy is still growing and growing at a very healthy rate. Our estimate, I mean, different people have different estimates, but broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow it around 2 percent per year. If you're growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining. People should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up. Lots of things should be happening. Businesses should be investing. So, you know, I guess to answer your question in a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think? Yes, as I said earlier, you know, we don't have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening. And therefore, we don't think that, we think it's unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economies had for a quarter of a century. The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that we think have, you know, really held down inflation. All that's out there still. You know, when we get through this, we may well be facing those same forces. Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we thought? Yes, and if we see inflation moving above our goals in a time, sorry, to an extent, to a level or persistent, or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that. Thank you going to Brian Chung with Yahoo. I'm about Brian Chung Yahoo Finance. On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity. I noted that the median projection for R-star, the longer-term interest rate is still the same at 2.5%. But there's been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe change productivity in addition to combine with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or R-star might be higher. What would the applications of that be for monetary policy? Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate and what might be the impact of that? A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount. And that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn, for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their policy rate was well below zero when the pandemic hit. So we don't want to be in a place where we can't react. A higher neutral rate would be, from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room in there for it than that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You can't estimate it with great precision. I think we would be alert to, I mean, studying our stories as a whole industry unto itself. And I think we would be alert to factors that might raise our star, the neutral rate of interest. And we'd try to keep up with that. And I think we're all thinking about that and the possibility of that. There are a lot of stories right now that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher our star. We don't know which of those stories will come true, but I mean, I'll give you an example. It's just there are a lot of startups, a lot of early stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don't know, but we'll be watching those things carefully. Great, thank you for the last question. We'll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. Mr. Chairman, of course, you'll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street. And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them. One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you're relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy. I wanted to get your view on how you square that. Another is that you have a long runway you've said for tapering with announcements. But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by a fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper? And finally, you've said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy. And there's a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly. So that's a few questions there. But so let me say first, I think people misinterpret the framework. I think there's nothing wrong with the framework and there's nothing in the framework that would in any way interfere with our ability to pursue our goals. That's for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework, we're certainly committed to it. We think it's well suited to our goals, including in this unique time. And I think if you look at the forecasts that we've written down, our committee is solidly behind them, the forecasts are all consistent with that. Your specific question, I guess, was will we be behind the curve? And that's not the situation we're facing at all. The situation that we addressed in our statement and longer run goals in monetary policy strategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low. And what we said was we wouldn't raise interest rates just because unemployment was low, employment was high, if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling and balances. So that's what we said. That is not at all the current situation. We have many millions of people who are unemployed and we have inflation running well above our target. The question we face with this inflation is nothing to do with our framework. It's a very difficult version of a standard investment, sorry, a central banking question. And that is how do you separate in inflation? How do you separate things that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of sort of video-syncratic factors in a particular, due to a particular thing? I mean, a classic example was to pick a narrow example was the cell phone price war back in 2017, if you remember it. There was a, prices were incredibly low and it held down core PCE by three tens or something for a year and then it fell out. So this is much bigger than that. And of course, it's not easy to tell in real time, which is which, but that's the question you would face under really any framework. And we're trying to sort that out. I've tried to explain that today about how we think about that. And we do think that these are temporary factors and that they'll win. We can't be absolutely certain about the timing of that and we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Your second one was, oh, we will take the time to talk about that. We will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress and we will communicate very carefully in advance on that and that's what we're doing. That's what we're going to do and we will follow through on that. There's no, I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction but ultimately when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will taper as appropriate. The third thing was, what was the third thing? If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy and the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far. That's right. And we have to balance the two goals, maximum employment and price stability. Often they do pull in the same direction, of course. But when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there's no question that has an effect on activity and that's one of the channels through which we get to inflation. We don't think that we're in a situation like that right now. We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole and an unusual hole actually because it's to do with shutting down the economy. It turns out it's a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to bring supply back up to snuff. That's happening all over the world. There's no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely. But we're going to watch carefully to make sure that evolving inflation and our understanding of what's happening.",-0.0005671479547227,0.0015842239667075,23,2021-06-16,False,False,False,False,-0.0053411481105097,Negative,Negative,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT      June 16, 2021

2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:40:00," Good afternoon. I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia's invasion. The human toll is tragic. The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us. In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. Economic activities are very important. The economy is very strong and against the backdrop of an extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the Federal Funds rate will be appropriate. In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting. Economic activity expanded at a robust 5.5% pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this year, but cases have declined sharply since mid-January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief. Although the invasion of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue to foresee solid growth. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8% this year, 2.2% next year, and 2% in 2024. The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight. Over the first two months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs. In February, the unemployment rate hit a post-pandemic low of 3.8%, a bit below the median of committee participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat, labor supply remains subdued. As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years. FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of this year, and remaining near that level thereafter. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Aggregate demand is strong, and bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond. These supply disruptions have been larger, and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods and services. Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine will put additional upward pressure on near-term inflation here at home. We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability. As we emphasize in our policy statement, with appropriate farming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to return to 2%, while the labor market remains strong. That said, inflation is likely to take longer to return to our price stability goal than previously expected. The median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 4.3% this year, and falls to 2.7% next year and 2.3% in 2024. This trajectory is notably higher than projected in December, and participants continue to see risks as weighted to the upside. The Fed's monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so. As I noted, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 1.25% each point, and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. The median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9% at the end of this year, a full percentage point higher than projected in December. Over the following two years, the median projection is 2.8%, somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer-run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. We have a meeting that wrapped up today, the committee made good progress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting. In making decisions about interest rates and the balance sheet, we will be mindful of the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability. As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels. The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to tighten credit conditions and affect the real economy. Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook, and we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment. We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations. The committee is determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Let's go to Gina at the New York Times. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you're considering the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you're weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded and getting behind the curve. I guess I would start by saying that in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated. Why do I say that? Aggregate demand is currently strong and most forecasters expected to remain so. If you look at the labor market, also very strong conditions are tight and payroll job growth is continuing at very high levels. How sold and business balance sheets are strong. And so all signs are that this is a strong economy indeed one that will be able to flourish, not to say with stand, but certainly flourish as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy. I guess that's how I would say I'm looking at that. Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market and that that is our overall objective, but we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy. Thank you. Let's go to Howard at Reuters. I was wondering in the in the steps you have quite a mark down to GDP from 4 to 2.8%. I'm wondering how much of that do you feel is the result of the feds stiffer than expected action here. I've been talking about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected? I think that's a big piece of it actually. I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels highly uncertain, but you're looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. We think that will weigh on GDP to some extent. That's part of what moved the assessment down. I don't think generally monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there. I think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between some of the economic and economic issues.",0.0030723046975773,0.0071092278719396,56,2022-03-16,True,True,False,False,-0.0045012645304995,Negative,Positive,"

2022-03-16 18:30:00,2022-03-16 18:40:00,2022-03-16 18:50:00," somewhere around 1-3-quarters percent, 2.8 percent, is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion. So while it's lower than last year's 5.8 percent, it's still quite strong growth. That's so I would say it's quite a strong forecast. So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes, ongoing increases? Doesn't really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly pace through the year. So, you know, the way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting, and we're going to be looking at evolving conditions. And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, to remove accommodation, then we'll do so. I can't be perfectly specific about it, but that's certainly a possibility as we go through the year. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Rachel at the Washington Post. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation, we'll start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better. And if you don't start to see that, how will you signal it? What will you be looking for, and what will you be looking for over the course of the year? Thank you. So, I guess I would say that before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, so let's go back to that. I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower, and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So, now we're getting, we're already seeing a little bit of short-term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas a little bit, but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices. The other thing is that you're seeing supply chain issues around shipping, and around lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods. So that's going to be more, more tangled supply chains. So that could actually push out the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally. So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year, but if you look at where the, I read the, the SCP headline median, we still expect inflation, inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we've seen so far this year. We expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down and then come down more sharply next year. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, over the last six months, the fetish that it's policy stands quite a bit. Six months ago, you were still buying assets. Most officials weren't projecting any interest rate increases this year. And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then. So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy? Thanks. So that's one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that the committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to the economy is very strong. As I mentioned, the tremendous momentum in the labor market, we expect growth to continue. As I, it's clearly time to raise interest rates and begin to balance sheet shrinkage. And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today's meeting, I saw a committee that's acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and determine to use our tools to do exactly that. You couched it in terms of real rates. I would say, if you look at the SEP, you've got people getting close to or even above in many cases, their estimate of the longer run neutral rate. So I understand that doesn't do it for real rates. But if you go out a year or two, many people are in their forecasts or having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint. So that's something that we're focused on. Of course, it's a highly uncertain environment. And we don't know what's going to happen. But we do know that we're going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals. And that includes the price stability goal. Let's go to Victoria at Politico. Hi, Chair Powell. So looking at the summary of economic projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3%. And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that's a little bit uncertain. So I was just wondering how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates? And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Blumraskin withdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio? Do you expect to assign a governor in charge of that? Okay. So sorry, tell me, tell me again, your first question. My first question is how much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed? Okay. So part of it, part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy. And those would include potentially supply chains getting a little bit better. Certainly, base effects, you're, you're lapping, as you know, when you look at a 12 month trailing window, you're lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year. So there should be some effects from that as in the 12 in the 12 month picture. Really, what we're looking for though is month by month inflation coming down. And so it's really, it's all the things we've been talking about, you know, that really haven't helped much, including the shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including work labor force participation, all those things that have been sticky and not happening. But a big part of it is though is the base effects I mentioned as well. You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation and on growth with a lag, of course. And so you would see that more in in in 23 and 24. But also remember, we started talking about rate increases last year for some months now. Financial conditions conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases. So it doesn't start today. The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now. So the clock is running on that. And I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well. And so on the regulatory portfolio, so I would just say this, you know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in the in supervision and regulation. And we're doing that. That's that's what we're doing. The committee is is not active. So what's happening is things are coming to the full board. And we're voting on them. We're getting our business done. You know, we got the stress tests done. We've we've looked at it, you know, number of proposals for mergers and things like that. So we are we are we're working ahead. Of course, we don't have a vice chair for supervision. As you mentioned. But we're we're we're making do with with the situation we have and a good number of things are have come straight to the board for approval. Let's go to Neil Irwin at exios. Let's go to Neil Irwin. I'd share Powell. It's new Irwin and exios. Thanks for taking our questions. And the statement back out projections. We see a forecast of median 1.9% fed fund rate at the end of the year, 2.8. End of next year. Wondered whether that aligns with your own expectations, in particular, on that point of overshooting the long term neutral rate. And also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced, front loaded, back loaded, how high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting? So I don't need. I've never talked about my own SEC SEC projection. It's in there. But I I think Fed shares have generally not done that because we just haven't done it's because we're you know, we're we have to put together the the consensus on the committee and present that consensus. So I wouldn't talk about my my individual one. And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is there seven remaining meetings this year. This isn't something we discuss or debate or agree on, but there's seven remaining meetings and there's seven rate hikes. I would add there's also the the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the the runoff of the balance sheet. So I don't but I don't know we haven't made any decisions on front end loading or or or going steadily through the year. And as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven rate increases this year.

 This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market 
 Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve’s operational tools 
 and approach used to implement monetary policy.",0.5225,"The Fed will likely end to its ultra-easy pandemic-era monetary policy with a rate rise of at least 25 basis points to fight surging inflation..“We’re strongly committed, as a committee, to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched, and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels.”
 Mr. Powell said the labor market and economy are so strong that the Fed thinks that both can handle higher interest rates..“They’re giving a tough message that they expect they will have to slow growth to bring inflation under control.”
 With the help of their policy changes, central bankers expect inflation to begin to moderate on its own this year, but they have become concerned that a meaningful deceleration will take time..The Fed’s quarterly economic projections, released alongside the rate decision, showed that officials expected inflation to hover around 4.3 percent at the end of 2022..Credit...

 Asked about that calibration on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that, in his view, “the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.” He cited strong demand, a healthy labor market and other conditions that he said were “signs” that the economy will be able to flourish “in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.”
 In the 1980s, the Fed pushed interest rates to high levels — above the level of inflation — in order to slow the economy and weigh down inflation..The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, but it's how hawkish Jerome Powell and the Fed sound in the forecast that's key for the U.S. economy..Fed Chair Powell indicated during recent testimony that he sees inflation running a little faster than the Fed's previous expectation, and any adjustment from the Fed is significant, Bostjancic said..""Our view is that the economy is strong enough and demand still strong enough that even with the impact from war we still see growth at 3% or higher this year, so the Fed needs to get to a neutral rate as quickly as possible without destabilizing the market,"" Bostjancic said..Fed officials indicated the rate increases would come with slower economic growth this year..The expected rate hike reflects ""where inflation is, where inflation expectations are, and just given the strength of the economy and a job market that is rip roaring,"" Zandi said..""You add all that up, it says the Fed has to normalize interest rates quickly, and I think at this point more quickly than they think, at least in terms of their last forecast, and maybe even more quickly than what the markets think at this point,"" Zandi said..""People are looking mainly for projections about rate hikes going forward and we expect that the Fed is not going to back off from the number of hikes that they are planning for this year but they may take a slower approach to do it."".Some economists have called for a more aggressive approach – with a .50% rate hike right out of the gate..WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will launch one of the most difficult tasks a central bank can attempt: Raise borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, but not so much as to topple the economy into recession.With a war raging in Europe and price increases at a four-decade high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will seek to engineer a ""soft landing"": A gradual slowdown in economic activity that helps curb surging prices, while keeping the job market and economy expanding.Yet many economists worry that with the price of gas and commodities spiking, the additional burden of higher interest rates could choke off growth entirely..""People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,"" Powell said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low - it's now 3.8% - or fall further..Others foresee growth decelerating to 2%, down from 5.7% last year.The economy's steady expansion does provide some cushion against higher rates and more expensive gas..Already, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in recent weeks that he would back a 25 basis point interest rate hike at the Fed's March meeting..ING strategists said in a note on Wednesday that they expected the Fed to implement six quarter percentage point rate hikes in 2022 and two more in 2023..Central bank officials — who have been signaling for months that they are preparing to pull back economic support — are expected to raise their policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point..Policymakers are telling markets and the public that they have fully pivoted to inflation-fighting mode and will do what is necessary to make sure price gains do not remain hot for months and years to come.",0.6799,"

 2022 Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen..Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially..Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher 
 energy prices, and broader price pressures..The 
 implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and 
 related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic 
 activity..The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the 
 longer run..With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects 
 inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong..In support 
 of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 
 to 1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate..In 
 addition, the Committee expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency 
 debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting..In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the 
 implications of incoming information for the economic outlook..The Committee would be prepared to 
 adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the 
 attainment of the Committee’s goals..The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide 
 range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation 
 pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments..(more)

 Asked about that calibration on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that, in his view, “the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.” He cited strong demand, a healthy labor market and other conditions that he said were “signs” that the economy will be able to flourish “in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.”

 The Federal Reserve is set to raise borrowing costs enough to tame inflation but not too much to send the economy into a recession..WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will launch one of the most difficult tasks a central bank can attempt: Raise borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, but not so much as to topple the economy into recession.With a war raging in Europe and price increases at a four-decade high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will seek to engineer a ""soft landing"": A gradual slowdown in economic activity that helps curb surging prices, while keeping the job market and economy expanding.Yet many economists worry that with the price of gas and commodities spiking, the additional burden of higher interest rates could choke off growth entirely..""People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,"" Powell said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low - it's now 3.8% - or fall further..The increase will send inflation higher, while probably also slowing growth - two conflicting trends that are difficult for the Fed to manage simultaneously.Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.9%, down from a previous estimate of 3.1%..Others foresee growth decelerating to 2%, down from 5.7% last year.The economy's steady expansion does provide some cushion against higher rates and more expensive gas..Already, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in recent weeks that he would back a 25 basis point interest rate hike at the Fed's March meeting..And to that end, many pundits expect to see the Fed upgrade its outlooks on inflation and the labor market this year..Watchers also anticipate that the Fed will offer a new quarterly forecast that could indicate five or six more hikes this year..ING strategists said in a note on Wednesday that they expected the Fed to implement six quarter percentage point rate hikes in 2022 and two more in 2023..""In all likelihood, a more hawkish Fed, for instance moving its dot plot to close to the number of hikes we're expecting in this cycle, would push rates higher,"" the strategists said..Central bank officials — who have been signaling for months that they are preparing to pull back economic support — are expected to raise their policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point..Policymakers are telling markets and the public that they have fully pivoted to inflation-fighting mode and will do what is necessary to make sure price gains do not remain hot for months and years to come..Investors are expecting the central bank to raise rates by at least 25 basis points amid rising prices.",0.6659,"{

We'll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation. We'll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgment. And we'll be going, each meeting is a live meeting. And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we'll do so. One second. Okay, we're gonna try one more time. Colby Smith at the FT. Okay, we'll come back to Colby. Let's go to Edward Lards. Yeah, thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you, Michelle, for the question. I have a more basic question. The last time this CPI inflation, I know you're looking at PCA, but CPI inflation was as high as it is as July of 1981 when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2%. But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the federal reserve is in your mind? So I just would say a couple of things. We have the tools that we need and we're going to use them. And as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet. We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched while also supporting a strong labor market. And as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we'll do so. I'll leave it to others to make the judgment you ask for. And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this. What impact has there been on your job given the fact that you lost you in the middle of a question? Edward, can you repeat that question? The impact that given you're not actually confirmed and governor brainer does not actually confirmed is there been any impact on your job or the if feasibility to handle inflation? None whatsoever. Okay, let's go to Colby Smith, the FT. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, how does the committee about the notable pickup and services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self correct? And to what extent does it alter both the committee's confidence that long term inflation expectations will not de-anchor in the coming months, as well as the balance of risk that the Fed may need to raise interest rates further above neutral and indicated in the dot bot. Thank you. Thank you. So of course, that's something we're watching report by report and we're certainly what we noticed it in the last meeting and it's part of the overall picture. We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was and that's part of what's happening is in the case of some services prices are still getting back up to where they were before the before the crisis. In other cases, it's pretty clear that the inflation has spread more broadly across services and yes, that is concerning. In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side, but really at this in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is admittedly a large, a large category. So, you know, as I mentioned, the committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so. Thank you. Let's go to Steve Leiceman at CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if you could help me understand the kind of logic if there is one in the SEP here. As I look at the media and forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three year window below the long run rate. I look at inflation between above over the three year window, the long run or call it the neutral rate to the economy still runs off. And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years, the funds rate above the long run rate. I guess my question is this, are you not create a give a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further behind the curve and never really get in front of inflation. Because the economy will continue to run hot and kind of on a related issue. You said earlier, inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected. Isn't that a choice you're making? And if so, why are you making that choice to the rental inflation run above price stability longer than you then you'd like. Right. So if you look, first of all, there is no, you're looking at medians, but understand that there's no, it's not something we voted on. It's not a plan. But if you look, people do have their, by the end of this year, broadly people are at or close to or in some cases above their estimates of longer run neutral interest rate. Okay. So that should, that should stop pushing that that should, in other words, that should be removal of accommodation for monetary policy. Basically, at the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff. And you can think of that as further. In the next year, and just looking at the median, you're now above the above the, what people estimate to be the longer run median. So, and also in many people's forecasts that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy in real rates as well. So why doesn't, why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent? You know, it, I mean, a couple points. One is the connection between in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight. And this is clearly what this is is an expectation that really it amounts to that the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation. We'll move back down to, to levels, which are still very attractive, full economy, kind of full employment, kind of wages, but not, not, not to a point where they're pushing up inflation anymore. And as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down. And, you know, the reality is there, there are many, many moving pieces and we don't know what will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. And so we are determined on that front and we'll deal with what comes. This is a modal or most likely expectation, but we will deal with what comes, whether it's better or worse. Thank you. Let's go to Chris Rugeber at the AP. Hi, thank you. Well, let me follow up a bit on that. I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you've penciled in without raising the unemployment rate. And I'm wondering just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand? I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed rates reduce consumer demand, unless it's through higher unemployment? Thank you. Well, if you take a look, take a look at today's labor market. What you have is 1.7 plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that's a very, very tight labor market, tied to an unhealthy level, I would say. So in principle, if you were, if, let's say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is we're trying to better align demand and supply, let's just say in the labor market. So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on wages. You would have, you would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy. We're hearing from companies that they can't hire enough people, they're having a hard time hiring. So that's really the thinking there is.",0.0013158354390581,0.0065319833900992,58,2022-03-16,True,False,False,False,-0.0045012645304995,Negative,Positive,"Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially..Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher

Inter-sensitive, and basically across the economy, we'd like to slow demand so that it's better lined with supply, gives supply at the same time, time to recover, and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand, and that over time should bring inflation down. And I'll say again, though, you know, we don't have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we're prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability. You know, with, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, you really can't have a sustained period of maximum employment. It's our, one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability. So we're very committed to that. Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention, and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability. Okay, let's go to Scott Horsley at NPR. Thanks, and I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr. Chair. I think I missed some of your answer there, but I haven't followed a question on the labor force. We have seen some gains in the prime age workforce in the last few months. I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed. Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back in the workforce? And what would that mean for wages and inflation? It's hard to say, you know, the, what we saw in the last cycle was that over the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations. And that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market. It wasn't, it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market, but it was a tight labor market. And so people stayed in the labor force longer. It wasn't so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement. That's not something that happens in the aggregate very much. But so that's what was happening. And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome. And of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that. This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time. And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better paying jobs in the same industry or different industry. So it's a really attractive labor market for people. And once, you know, as we get past COVID, well and truly, it becomes even more attractive. And so we hope that that will lead to more labor supply. That's a good thing for the country. It's a good thing for people. And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk. That last part is you will have to see whether empirically it winds up works out that way. But in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well. It's not the only thing we're looking for, though, from inflation. We're looking for help from another different, a number of different places and most importantly, from our own policy. OK, let's go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg. Thank you. Michelle, thank you, Chair Powell. I'm sorry. I'm having some communication problems. So I've missed some of the stuff you've said in my apologies if this has been asked. Since the FOMC met in last January, financial conditions have tightened markedly equity prices down. Treasury yields up. Bond Spirits. Risen, yield perv is flattened a lot, and even further this today, it's out there itself. Is that welcome? And would you like to see more in order to achieve your goals? Thank you. So as you know, policy works through financial conditions. That's how it reaches the real economy, by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive and appropriately so fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy. The monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic. So it is very appropriate to move away from those. And yes, that will lead to some tightening and financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things. We're not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level. So that because we know the economy no longer needs or wants these very highly accommodative stance, which, you know, it's time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions. And we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels. What do you say move to more normal setting for financial conditions? That suggests to me that you want financial conditions that tighten further from where we are now. Am I drawing the right inference from that? Well, yes. So I would say we look at a broad range of financial conditions. And of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy. It's not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions. They will reflect to some extent. They reflect any number of things. But yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy. And it does so through financial conditions, which means as we tighten policy, or remove accommodation so that it's at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative. Thank you. Just a little housekeeping note. Those of you in this call may be having some tech issues. If so, I understand the broadcasts coming through clearly on www.fedorreserve.gov. So you might go there for the audio. And now we'll go to Genie. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you've had at this meeting. Can you give us any more details? Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs and whether to increase those caps over what period event if there were any details? Yes. Thank you for asking. So at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet. And I'd say we're now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we're actually beginning runoff at a coming meeting. And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May. That's not a decision that we've made. But I would say that that's how well our discussions went in the last two days. So a couple of things just to add, we'll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context to when we make the decision on timing. And we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability. We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what's a highly uncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this. In terms of the, I would say this, I don't want to get too much into the details because we're literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this. But it'll be faster than the last time. And of course, it's much sooner in a cycle than last time. But it will look familiar to you. And I would also say that there'll be, I'm sure there'll be a more detailed discussion of our, in the minutes to our meeting, that come out in three weeks where I expect that it will lay out to pretty much the parameters of what we're looking at, which I think will look quite familiar. Thank you. Let's go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you've been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down. That seems to be over, but I'm wondering how you would describe your reaction function now. What is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down? And as in other words, is it, we're going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level? Yeah, so I want to clear one thing up again. And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates. What we said in the framework changes was, and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually. What we said was if we see low unemployment, high employment, but we don't see inflation, then we're not going to raise rates until we actually see inflation. That's what we said, and that was the sense of it. There was no sense in which if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates. That's simply not in the framework. In fact, quite the contrary, the framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2%. So I do hear this, that the framework, really, we can't blame the framework. It was a sudden unexpected burst of inflation and then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was, but it was not in any way caused or related, caused by or related to the framework. So come to today. I think our vision on this on the committee is very, very clear. What we see is a strong labor market. We see a labor market with a lot of people.",0.0004651920080012,0.005100258506253,59,2022-03-16,False,False,False,False,-0.0045012645304995,Negative,Positive,"

 Mr. Powell said the labor market and economy are so strong that the Fed thinks that both can handle higher interest rates..“They’re giving a tough message that they expect they will have to slow growth to bring inflation under control.”
 With the help of their policy changes, central bankers expect inflation to begin to moderate on its own this year, but they have become concerned that a meaningful deceleration will take time..Mr. Powell on Wednesday noted that inflation is “well above” the Fed’s target and that supply chain disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than expected..The Fed aims for both price stability and maximum employment, and central bank officials have indicated that the labor market is meeting that latter goal, though they hope more workers will return as fears of catching the coronavirus ease and as child-care issues tied to school shutdowns and other virus mitigation measures fade..There is a “misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market, and that is leading to wages moving up in ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,” he said..“We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched,” Mr. Powell said..“The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”
 While Mr. Powell reinforced time and again how important it is to do whatever it takes to get inflation under control, he also made it clear that central bankers are hoping to engineer a soft landing: A situation where they can slow growth down to a maintainable level without derailing the economy and causing a recession..I don't think they'll tolerate stagflation because they know based on historical experience that if we get into that scenario, we'll ultimately suffer a recession."".""People are looking mainly for projections about rate hikes going forward and we expect that the Fed is not going to back off from the number of hikes that they are planning for this year but they may take a slower approach to do it."".""The timing couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk..Central bankers have embarked on a lengthy process to tamp down inflation..With inflation levels at a 40-year high and the conflict in Ukraine threatening even more economic turmoil, we need an all-hands-on-deck approach to stabilize prices and provide relief to the American people..Advertisement

Yes, there are threats to growth from what's going on in Eastern Europe. But nonetheless, in the base case, there's a pretty broad expectation of strong growth. But inflation is far above our target. And the help we've been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better, it hasn't come. And so we're looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we're committed to doing that. And you see that, I think, in the summary of economic projections. And you see that in the decision we make, and you will continue to see it in the decisions we make going forward. If I could follow up by asking, I guess what you'd call it is the Paul Volker question. You don't think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates? Well, the goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. We have a dual mandate in there sort of equal. But as I said earlier, price stability is an essential goal. In fact, it's a precondition really for achieving the kind of labor market that we want. Which is a strong and sustained labor market. We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market. It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion. It's just the pandemic arrived, just to completely exogenous event. So that's how we're thinking about it. We of course want to achieve price stability with a strong labor market. But we do understand also that really you can't have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability. So we need to focus on price stability in particular, particularly because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Chung at Yahoo. I turn around. Hopefully no tech issues here on this front. Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed's doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SCP is. How is the 25 basis point height today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they're feeling at the stores on a daily basis? Sure. So I guess I'd start by just assuring everyone that we're fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people's well-being. And really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone, but really especially on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation where I mean, we've all seen charts that show if you're a middle income person, you've got room to absorb some inflation. If you're at the lower end of the income spectrum, it's very hard because you're spending most of your money already on necessities and the price is going up. But it's punishing for everyone. So it has been a difficult time for the economy, but we do anticipate that that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier. It may take longer than we like, but I'm confident that we'll use our tools to bring inflation down. And you ask about rates. So the way that works, I would explain is as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it's better match with supply, and that brings, that will bring inflation down over time. That's our plan. Thank you. Let's go to Joe Lincant at NBC News. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking my question doing this today. My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked. What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation? Well, that is, yes, indeed. I mean, as I just said, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take the heart that it's our obligation to restore price stability. We've had price stability for a very long time, and maybe come to take it for granted. But now we see the pain. I'm old enough to remember what very high inflation was like, and we're strongly committed as a committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched, and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which our target is 2% inflation. So we will do that, and I just want people to understand that, and that's, but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet, and so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity, that will slow the economy while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong. And the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong, and that means the economy we think can handle interest rate increases. And if we look follow up to that, obviously the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession for the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs at a possible recession, what do you say to that? Well, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2% while still sustaining a strong labor market, and that the economy is very strong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that's strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output. So, and we expect that to continue. To the extent the data come in different, then of course our policy will adapt. But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation. We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market. The labor market is not strong in the ordinary sense of the world. We haven't worked. We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person, or where there if you add job openings to those who are employed, that's actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce, than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce. So, this is a situation where demand is higher than supply. And when that happens, prices go up. And so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back. And we don't think we need to do this alone. There will be other factors helping that happen. But we certainly are prepared to use our tools, and we will. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go to Simon at the Economist. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute. May I ask about the sanctions on Russia, and specifically the freezing of the Central Bank of Assets? Of course, that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world, and they're biggest companies' potential. Any concerns about, in the long term, how this might affect the dollar status as the permanent global reserve currency, and in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any claims of reassurance to other central bankers around the world? Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very, very in favour of these sanctions. But let me say this, sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that's true everywhere. So the administration, the Treasury Department in particular, and other agencies, they create these sanctions. We're there to provide technical expertise, but it's not our decisions. And so I'm reluctant to comment on sanctions really much, because, again, they're not for us. We have a very specific mandate, and these are really the province of elected governments as I mentioned. So I'd have to leave it at that. Sorry. Thank you. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. People talk a lot about rising wages, which on the one hand is a great thing, but are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage crisis spiral? So the way I would say it is this. We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing. That's how the standard of living rises over time. And generally, it's driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at we're blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now, they're all showing the same thing, which is that the increases, not the levels, but the increases, are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2% inflation or goal over time. And that may be, we don't know how persistent that phenomenon will be. It's very hard to say. And that's really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage-price spiral is, is that something that's going to start happening and become entrenched in the system? We don't see.",0.0047428624569887,0.0052566696904146,60,2022-03-16,True,True,False,False,-0.0045012645304995,Negative,Positive,"

 In the 1980s, the Fed pushed interest rates to high levels — above the level of inflation — in order to slow the economy and weigh down inflation..The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, but it's how hawkish Jerome Powell and the Fed sound in the forecast that's key for the U.S. economy..This is based on a labor market that is strong and a consumer that is resilient, and the Fed being behind the curve on inflation already..While there are complicating factors such as the war in Ukraine, the most prominent issue for the Fed is that economic growth remains quite strong..The ""dot plot"" and the Fed's economic projections for GDP and inflation will need to be digested by the market, but ultimately, it's how Fed Chair Jerome Powell frames the Fed thinking on Wednesday that matters most..""Our view is that the economy is strong enough and demand still strong enough that even with the impact from war we still see growth at 3% or higher this year, so the Fed needs to get to a neutral rate as quickly as possible without destabilizing the market,"" Bostjancic said..While this week's producer price index showed a slight undershoot of the inflation expectation and the latest wage inflation reading came down, the recent flow of data has reinforced that the inflationary pressures are still widespread and elevated, and the Fed needs to raise rates and has the ability to raise in a significant way..It gives the market a sense of comfort that the Fed is on the ball, they're going to start moving interest rates and we could get to a place where inflation begins to temper,"" said John Cunnison, chief investment officer at Baker Boyer in Walla Walla, Washington..Fed officials indicated the rate increases would come with slower economic growth this year..The expected rate hike reflects ""where inflation is, where inflation expectations are, and just given the strength of the economy and a job market that is rip roaring,"" Zandi said..""You add all that up, it says the Fed has to normalize interest rates quickly, and I think at this point more quickly than they think, at least in terms of their last forecast, and maybe even more quickly than what the markets think at this point,"" Zandi said..""I don't think the market is signaling yet a recession but they're thinking along the same lines that I am – that it's going to be very difficult for the Federal Reserve to land the plane on the tarmac given all the things that are going on and all the things they have to navigate."".""People are looking mainly for projections about rate hikes going forward and we expect that the Fed is not going to back off from the number of hikes that they are planning for this year but they may take a slower approach to do it."".""The timing couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk..Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the short and medium term have gone up, according to the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reversing declines in January..Central bankers have embarked on a lengthy process to tamp down inflation..The Fed hopes that higher rates will curb demand and help bring America's soaring inflation back to a more palatable level and towards the central bank's long-term goal of 2%..Advertisement
 
 
 The Federal Reserve is set to raise borrowing costs enough to tame inflation but not too much to send the economy into a recession..""People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,"" Powell said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low - it's now 3.8% - or fall further..Consumers are spending at a healthy pace, and employers keep rapidly hiring..Investors this week have been gearing up to receive the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision, which is likely to show the first of multiple interest rate hikes this year..And to that end, many pundits expect to see the Fed upgrade its outlooks on inflation and the labor market this year..""We've got a strong labor market, higher than expected inflation..Markets await the Federal Reserve’s afternoon policy announcement

You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level. But it comes back to what I'm saying here, which is there is a misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market. And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so we need to use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2%. And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market. We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy and the overall economy can as well. But yes, wages are moving up faster than it's consistent with 2% inflation. But it's good to see them moving up, but it wouldn't be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher. And that's because of this misalignment between supply and demand. We expect to get more labor supply. We did last time. We got more than we expected last during the last cycle. This time we've gotten much less than expected. So it's not easy to predict these things. But we do expect that we'll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people's lives, something we all wish. But so that's how we think about it. Thank you. And for the last question, we'll go to Don Lee at LA Times. Hi, Chair Powell. I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that in hindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier. And it sounds like today that you don't think that the Fed is late. And just wanted to get your clarification on that. And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is behind the curve, how much behind the curve is it? Right. So we are not, we don't have the luxury of 2020 hindsight in actually implementing real time decisions in the world. So the question is, the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you do at the time? But that's not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now. So I think if we knew now, of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages really and the inflation resulting from them in collision with very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to move earlier. Obviously it would be. But again, we don't have that luxury. And then so that's a separate question from your other question, which is behind the curve. And I don't have the luxury of looking at it that way. We are, we have our tools, powerful tools, and the committee is very focused on using them. We're acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market. And what I saw today was a committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability in particular and prepared to use our tools to do that. We're not going to let high inflation become entrenched. The costs of that would be too high. And we're not going to wait so long that we have to do that. No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on in order to get inflation back down. So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practically can. And then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate. And as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense, it just to people's SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer run neutral rates. And there's also a range of estimates too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP. But thanks for your question. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks, Mr. Chair.

2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:40:00," Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message. We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing. We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. The economy in the country have been through a lot over the past two and a half years and have proved resilient. It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. Overall, economic activity edged down in the first quarter as unusually sharp swings in inventories and net exports more than offset continued strong underlying demand. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth has picked up this quarter with consumption spending remaining strong. In contrast, growth in business-fixed investment appears to be slowing and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening in part reflecting higher mortgage rates. The tightening in financial conditions that we've seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply. As shown in our summary of economic projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2% through 2024. The labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated. Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year, but still robust. The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics. Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued with the labor force participation rate little changed since January. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance, easing the upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7% at the end of this year to 4.1% in 2024, levels that are noticeably above the March projections. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%, over the 12-month sending in April, total PCE prices rose 6.3%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 4.9%. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index came in above expectations at 8.6%, and the change in the core CPI was 6%. Agregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and long lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services. The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation. And COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total PCE inflation, given developments in food and energy prices. The median projection is 5.2% this year and falls to 2.6% next year and 2.2% in 2024. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Once the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been adapting and it will continue to do so. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point, resulting in a 1-1-1-half percentage point increase in the target range so far this year. The committee reiterated that it anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. We are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Moving out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the committee that a half percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectations. We also stated that we were highly attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside. Some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and projections for inflation this year have been revised up notably. In response to these developments, the committee decided that a larger increase in the target range was warranted at today's meeting. This continues our approach of expeditiously moving our policy rate up to more normal levels and it will help ensure that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2%. As shown in the SCP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 3.4% at the end of this year. A percentage point and a half higher than projected in March and 0.9% above the median estimate of its longer run value. The median projection rises further to 3.8% at the end of next year and declines to 3.4% in 2024, still above the median longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee plan or decision and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. The pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Clearly, today's 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. From the perspective of today, either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting. We will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting and we'll continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as we can. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways. Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store. We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time. We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We, at the Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Howard Schneider, with Reuters. Two related questions, Chair Powell. Do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July? And would you please give us as detailed a sense you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday? So as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook because we think monetary policy is more effective.",0.0071506710424504,0.0174674836074384,67,2022-06-15,True,True,True,False,-0.0063600782778864,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT       June 15, 2022

 June 15 (UPI) -- Amid persistent concerns about rising costs in the United States, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a policy meeting and is expected to do something it hasn't done in almost 30 years to get control of inflation..By increasing interest rates, the Fed is attempting to get Americans to borrow less, lower demand and freeze prices..""Admittedly, slowing just enough to cool inflation but not cause a recession is an extremely delicate balancing act given that monetary policy is a blunt instrument, not a surgical tool..“Markets were expecting the Fed to deliver a supersized rate hike, as all the recent data shows inflation expectations just are not easing any time.”
 Earlier, the European Central Bank unexpectedly got in on the action, calling an unscheduled meeting of policymakers on Wednesday to discuss market conditions..Meanwhile, the highest inflation rise in four decades has investors pricing in a once-unthinkable 75 basis-point rate increase at the Fed’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and worries are growing that the central bank won’t be able to tame consumer prices without tipping the economy into a recession..The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its policy decision at 1800 GMT, with a focus on how aggressive it would be on interest rate hikes to combat decades-high inflation.",0.6998,"{

2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:40:00,2022-06-15 18:50:00," when market participants understand how policy will evolve when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it's helpful to provide even more clarity than usual, again, subject to uncertainty and the outlook. So, and I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have generally shown that they understand the path we're laying out. Of course, it remains data dependent. And so, that's what we generally think about guidance and that's why we offer it. And of course, when we offered that, when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations. I also said that if the economy performed, if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week. And we thought for a while and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So then the question is, what do you do? Do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is that's not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead and so we did. And that's really how we made the decision. Thank you, Gina. Thanks for taking our questions, Gina, for my look at the New York Times. You, I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you're deciding how aggressive you need to be. So obviously 75 today, what did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn't have and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point? Sure. So if you take a step back, what we're looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down. And we'd like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings. That's what we're looking for. And by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flat and out and ideally beginning to decline. We've said that we'd be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attended inflation risks, the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again, surprise to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations have risen and projections of this year have moved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point, rate hike as I mentioned. So what was the point of it really is this, we've been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels. And over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we've seen financial conditions tighten inappropriately so. But the federal funds rate even after this move is at 1.6%. So again, the committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels. And we came to the view that we'd like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This was really about the speed with which you would get there. So as I mentioned, we, 75 basis points today, I said the next meeting could, could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would put us at the end of the July meeting in that range, in that more normal range. And that's a desirable place to be because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second. What it really says is that committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restrictive level at the end of this year. And that's six months from now. And so much data and so much can happen. So remember how highly uncertain this is. But so that is generally a range of three to three and a half percent. That's where people are. And that's what they want to see knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to show resolve but also be flexible to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don't need to do that much. So, and if they're not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be very data dependent. And you're looking at next year in what you're seeing is people see more, a bit more tightening and in a range of maybe three and a half to four percent. And that's generally what people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and then getting back down to two percent. So 75 basis points seem like the right thing to do with this meeting. And that's what we did. Steve Leisman, CMBC, thank you for taking my question Mr. Chairman. You have not used the phrase in a long time monetary policy is in a good place, which is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the committee is projecting 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now. The future is market of 4 percent funds right next year. Do you think that's a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a follow up, could you break that apart from me? How much of that is restrictive? And how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not in your opinion in the funds rate? Thank you. Sure. So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go? And this is the estimates on the committee are in that range of 3.5 to 4 percent. And how do you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer run neutral rate. You can compare it to that. And we think that's in the mid-to's. You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions. You can look at asset prices. You can look at the effect you're having on the economy. Rates, asset prices, credit spreads, all of those things go into that. You can also look at the yield curve and ask all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive. That's not true at the short end. At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you have negative rates still. So that really is one data point. It's one part of financial conditions. So I think I have to look at it this way. We move the policy rate. That affects financial conditions, and that affects the economy. We have, of course, rigorous ways to think about it. But ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they're having the desired effect on the economy? And that desired effect is we'd like to see demand moderating. Demand is very hot still in the economy. We'd like to see the labor market getting better and balanced between supply and demand. And that can happen both from supply and demand. And right now, demand is substantially higher than available supply, though. So we feel that there's a role for us in moderating demand. Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can't affect. And those would be the commodity price issues that we're having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that. And also just all of the supply side things that are still pushing upward on inflation. So that's really how I think I would think about it. But just 3.8% 4% get it done because they get the jobs done, and they're breaking the back of inflation. I think it certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we'll know when we get there, really. I mean, honestly, that would be, you would have positive real rates. I think an inflation coming down by then. I think you'd have positive real rates across the curve. I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would think it would. But we're going to find that out empirically. We're not going to be completely modeled driven about this. We're going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open and reacting to incoming data, both on financial conditions and on what's happening in the economy. Thanks, Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chipel, you've said that you like your policy to work through expectations. And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermuting period. And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data, the inflation expectations data. But I'm wondering on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had socialized before? So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations, so you've got the public, you've got surveys of the public and of experts and you've also got market-based. And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place where short term inflation is going to be high, but comes down sharply over the next couple of years. That's really where inflation expectations are. And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2%. And so this is really very important to us that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most measures most of the time, that's what you see.",0.0074711882368525,0.015633709356337,68,2022-06-15,True,True,True,False,-0.0063600782778864,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT       June 15, 2022

2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 18:50:00,2022-06-15 19:00:00," If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted. We take it very seriously. So the preliminary Michigan reading, it's a preliminary reading. It might be revised nonetheless. It was quite eye catching and we noticed that. We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations that the board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time. So we're watching that and we're thinking this is something we need to take seriously. And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned, one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points. Today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We're absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2%. That was one of the reasons, the other was just the CPI reading. So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting? We're going to, I'll just say, we're going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think. So I wouldn't want to put a number on what that might be. The main thing is to get rates up and then pretty soon we'll be in an area where we're, I think, because you get closer to the end of the year, you're in an arrange where you've got restrictive policy, which is appropriate. 40-year highs in inflation. We think that policy is going to need to be restrictive. We don't know how restrictive. So I think that's how we'll take it. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil or I'm from Axios. Thanks for taking our questions. The late breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points. Do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future? And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if labor market starts to roll over? So take your second question first, yes. I mean, I think we're, again, we're going, we're resolved to take this on, but we're going to be flexible in the implementation of it. Sorry, and your question was guidance. So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be, provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. Because it's always a trade off, because you have to live with that guidance. And so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I frankly think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work. With us having really just done a very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we've made it clear what our plans are. So I think that's been a very healthy thing to be happening. So, and I would hope that it's always going to be any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect. And in this particular situation, we're looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. We want to see, inflation can't go down until it flattens out. And that's what we're looking to see. And if we don't see that, then that's the kind of thing that we'll call, even if we don't see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react. But we will soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point, and we'll react appropriately to that too. But I would like to think though that our guidance is still credible, but it's always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an unusual situation to get some data late in during blackout, pretty close, very close to our meeting. Very unusual to one that would actually change the outcome. So, I've only seen in my 10 years plus here at the Fed, I've only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times. So I don't think it's something that will come up a great deal. Call me. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Call me Smith with the Financial Times. On the clear and convincing threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria? And how is the committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace? The second part I didn't get. If what's the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what's forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace? Right. So what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation and we like to see inflation headed down. But right now our policy rate is well below neutral. So soon enough we'll have our policy rate. Let's assume the world works out about like the SEP says the policy rate will be up where we think it should be. And then the question would be do you slow down? Does it make you, you know, you'll be making these judgments about is it appropriate now to slow down from 50 to 25 let's say or speed up? You know, so that's the kind of thinking we'll be doing and we'll be, again we're looking ultimately we're not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, you know, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence that inflation is coming down. And that's what I mean by, that's what it would take for us to say, okay, we're going to say, okay, we think this is, this job is done because we saw, and frankly we saw last year inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turn right around and went back up. So I think we're going to be careful about declaring victory. But again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data. Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation it's going to require more than just some pain at this point? So again, I think that I do think that they're objective and this is what's reflected in the SCP, but our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2% while the labor rocket remains strong. I think that what's becoming more clear is that many factors that we don't control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that's possible or not. And there I'm thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain things like that, where we really can't, the monetary policy stance doesn't affect those things. But having said that, there is a path for us to get there. It's not getting easier. It's getting more challenging because of these external forces. And that path is to move demand down and you have a lot of surplus demand in the labor market. So you have two vague job vacancies essentially for every person's seek actively seeking a job and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level and you wouldn't expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level. People are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation. So that's a possibility and you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there's just excess capacity and where the strong demand has gone into, sorry, where there's capacity constrained. So you have effectively what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand comes in and it's very strong and it shows up in higher prices, not higher quantities, not more cars because they can't make the cars because they don't have the semiconductors. So in principle, that could work in reverse. And demand comes down. You could see and it's not guaranteed, but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest because of the unusual situation we're in on the supply side. So there's a pathway there. It is not going to be easy and, you know, there, there, again, it's our objective, but as I mentioned, it's going to depend on some extent on factors we don't control. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. So the new projection show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024 is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation and what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation. Thank you. So you're right. In the, in the SEP, we have unemployment going up to four point, the median is, is 4.1% there, of course, a range of, of, of actual forecasts. And I would characterize that if you, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2%, and the unemployment went up to rate went up to 4.1%, that's still a, you know, historically low level. You know, we hadn't seen, we hadn't seen rates, unemployment rates below 4% until a couple of years ago for, we'd seen it for like one year in the last 50. So the idea that, you know, 3, 3.6% is historically low.",-0.0054968176318974,0.0108684126815819,69,2022-06-15,True,True,True,False,-0.0063600782778864,Negative,Negative,"Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has

 May 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave investors a glimmer of hope that the central bank is unlikely to become more hawkish in coming months, though few see reason for long-term optimism in the face of soaring inflation and fears of slowing growth..The Fed delivered an expected 50 basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday, but said larger hikes were not on the table among policymakers, allaying some investors’ fears that the central bank would raise rates by 75 basis points in upcoming meetings..Powell “took 75 bps off the table and already talked up how core inflation is looking better, which could lower the path of rate hikes.”
 Expectations of a hawkish Fed have weighed heavily on markets this year..The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points in March, its first hike since 2018, and the market is pricing in some 191 basis points of tightening for the year..FEDWATCH
 Some market participants believe Powell’s comments – which envisaged 50-basis-point hikes each in June and July, potentially the steepest increases in the Fed funds rate since 1994 – showed the Fed has grown as hawkish as it's likely to get for the time being..“At this stage, we believe the Fed has pivoted to an appropriately hawkish stance and is likely done surprising markets for a while..""We believe this shows the Fed is more determined to do what it takes to end the inflation overshoot as rapidly as possible even if that raises the chance of a hard landing in 2023,"" TD Macro said in the report..The central bank is now widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the first time since 1994..The likelihood of such a hike had been seen remote as recently as mid-last week, especially since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said clearly in May that policymakers were not actively considering an increase greater than 50 basis points..""The inflation fix will not be more effective if the Fed hikes by 75bp [basis points] today or next month, rather than 25bp, and the damage done to private sector wealth could inadvertently trigger a downturn which otherwise would be averted,"" Shepherdson added..Analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to hike the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps)..They said a rate hike of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the Indian stock markets but the US Fed’s commentary on growth, inflation and future rate hikes will be the key watch out for..FOMC Meet: What Is Being Expected
 Given the latest inflation print of 8.6 per cent as against the US Federal Reserve’s target to control it under two per cent, most economists and analysts expect the American central bank to go for a 75-basis-point hike in the Fed fund rate..Experts said the possible rate hike by the US Fed of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the markets..The aggressive rate hike of 50-75 bps is mostly factored by the market but updated economic and interest rate forecasts to be detailed by the central bank’s will closely control the future trend..""Definitely, we're going to see 75 basis points after this meeting,"" Bill Dudley, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told CNN..Federal Reserve expected to increase cost of borrowing by 0.75 percentage points to curb rising inflation
 The world’s financial markets are bracing themselves for the sharpest rise in US interest rates in almost 30 years, as America’s central bank takes action to halt rising inflation..The Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, had previously ruled out a 0.75 point increase but the central bank appears to have had a change of heart after higher than expected US inflation was announced last week..Fed policymakers later on Wednesday are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points in order to quell inflation running at a more than 40-year high..Amid persistent concerns about rising costs in the U.S., the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a policy meeting and is expected to do something it hasn't done in almost 30 years to get control of inflation..Goldman Sachs this week adjusted its forecast and expects a three-quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday and at the Fed's next policy meeting in July, followed by a half-point increase in September..Markets broadly expect between nine and 10 rate hikes from now to early 2023, with at least 50 basis point increments at each of the next three Federal Open Market Committee meetings and a terminal rate of 4%..Investors have drastically shifted their expectations about Wednesday’s decision to a rate hike of 75 basis points (bps) - not the 50 bps the market was expecting last week..Meanwhile, the highest inflation rise in four decades has investors pricing in a once-unthinkable 75 basis-point rate increase at the Fed’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and worries are growing that the central bank won’t be able to tame consumer prices without tipping the economy into a recession..The Federal Reserve is anticipated to raise interest rates by 75 basis points Wednesday, just weeks after Chair Jerome Powell & his staff projected a half-percentage-point increase..The Federal Reserve is now expected to hike interest rates by 75 basis points Wednesday, just weeks after Chair Jerome Powell and his team repeatedly advertised a half percentage point move.",0.6326,"{

2022-06-15 18:30:00,2022-06-15 19:00:00,2022-06-15 19:10:00," in the last century. So a 4.1% unemployment rate with inflation and well on its way to 2%. I think that would be a successful outcome. So we're not looking to have a higher unemployment rate, but I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome. I think people lose on their jobs or anything. You know, we're not, again, we don't seek to put people out of work. Of course, we never think too many people are working and fewer people need to have jobs. But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market. And that's a labor market where workers are getting wage increases, maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases as they were before the pandemic, where participation is high, where there's lots of job opportunities, where it's just a really, I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was, that's what we want to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups that historic lows. We'd love to get back to that place. But to get there, it's not going to happen with the levels of inflation we have. So we have to restore that. And it really isn't service in the medium and longer term of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve. Hi, Chair Powell, Matthew Bosa with Bloomberg. So as you just mentioned, the committee is now projecting a half percentage point of rise in the unemployment rate and the ACPs over the next couple years. And it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy. You just mentioned that that is still your objective, though. So I'm wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement also whether this means that FOMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down. I'm not trying to reduce, it do's a recession now. Let's be clear about that. We're trying to achieve 2% inflation consisting with a strong labor market. That's what we're trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly it's our goal to bring about 2% inflation while keeping the labor market strong. And that's what the ACP says. The ACP has inflation getting down to a little above 2% in 2024 with unemployment at 4.1%. So this is a strong labor market. This is a good labor market. And as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy effectively alone can bring about the result of 2% inflation with a strong labor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. It just didn't, the sentence isn't, it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this. And that's not, that just didn't seem appropriate so we took the sentence up. And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence, again, say a month ago or three months ago, that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply side issues get worked out? Thanks. Well, yeah, I think you've seen, again, we've been expecting progress. And we didn't get that. We got sort of the opposite. So I also think the situation really since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you're seeing is the situation getting more difficult. And you look around the world. I mean, lots of countries are, lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10%. And it's largely due to commodities prices. But all over the world, you're seeing these effects. And we're seeing them here. Gas prices, all time highs and things like that. That's not something we can do something about. So that is really, and by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations. People, the public expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline inflation is what people experience. They don't know what core is. The why would they have no reason to? So that's expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation. So it's become, the environment has become more difficult, clearly in the last four or five months. And hence the need for the policy actions that we took today. Hence our resolution to get rates up and ultimately get them to where we think they need to be in coming months. Thanks, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. I want to ask you, you talked about CPI going to 8.6%. The retail sales surprised the market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down. Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits? So we're of course watching very, very carefully for that. And looking at the retail sale, the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. And so I think the fair summary of what we see is you see continuing shifts in consumption. You see some things getting sales going down. But overall spending is very strong. The consumers in really good shape financially, they're spending, there's no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy. People are talking about it a lot. Consumer confidence is very low. It's probably related to gas prices. And also just stock prices, to some extent, for other people. But that's what we're saying. We're not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it's still at quite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit, but still growth levels, healthy growth levels. So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending or is there something, another indicator that you're watching more closely? It would be hard to much anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending. But we watch everything. We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit. And we're responsible for watching everything. But consumption is 60% of the economy, 2 thirds of the economy. So naturally we spend a lot of time on that. And again, there's a lot going on. There are a lot of flows back and forth, but ultimately, it does appear that the US economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates. My name is Jane. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Michael and Keith from Bloomberg Radio and television. Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? If that's going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down? So we're responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation means headline inflation. So that's our ultimate goal. We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation, because it's a much better predictor. And it's much better predictor of where inflation is going. And it's also more relevant to our tools. As I mentioned, the parts that don't go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tool. So we look at that. But the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations. We can't affect really. The energy prices are set by global commodity prices. And most of food, not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too, also other things. So we can't really have much of an effect. But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations from headline. So it's a very difficult situation to be in. And again, we can't do much about the difference between the elements that make up headline that are not in core. Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP when the members gave their forecasts when were they inserted into the record where they revised after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out. In other words, does the SEP as we have it now reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move? The SEP is of one piece. It reflects all of the economic readings. It also reflects the 75 basis point increase. This is important. So people had that in hand when their SEPs were submitted. So it's not in addition to what's in the SEP. Everyone's SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what's going forward. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Aguida from Politico.

 The statement continued to cite the Ukraine war and China lockdown policies as sources of inflation..The stricter monetary policy was accompanied with a downgrade to the Fed’s economic outlook, with the economy now seen slowing to a below-trend 1.7% rate of growth this year, unemployment rising to 3.7% by the end of this year, and continuing to rise to 4.1% through 2024..The projections are a break with recent Fed efforts to cast tighter monetary policy and inflation control as consistent with steady and low unemployment..Since March, when Fed officials projected they could raise rates and control inflation with the unemployment rate remaining around 3.5%, inflation has stubbornly remained at a 40-year high, with no sign of it reaching the peak Fed policymakers hoped would arrive this spring..Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell now has little choice but to go bigger on rate hikes, inflicting more pain on people already struggling with high food and gas prices..""But the medium-term (market) outlook is the Fed wanting to tighten financial conditions and so that means lower equity valuations."".""We at the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation is causing,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press briefing Wednesday..""We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so."".The latest move is only one part of a rate-hiking cycle, which aims to crush inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, as some fear could happen..""The Fed is trying to fight that with higher interest rates to reduce demand."".Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
 Still, Powell’s message appeared to fuel the hopes of investors who believe markets may have already priced in the extent of Fed hawkishness for now..Powell “took 75 bps off the table and already talked up how core inflation is looking better, which could lower the path of rate hikes.”
 Expectations of a hawkish Fed have weighed heavily on markets this year..Signs that inflation is continuing to exceed market expectations could erode confidence in the Fed’s outlook and weaken asset prices..And although Powell said he was confident the Fed could tame inflation without pushing the economy into recession, some investors remained doubtful the central bank could engineer a so-called soft landing..After the Fed's last meeting in May, when it raised its benchmark rate by a half-point, Chair Jerome Powell said that similar increases were “on the table” for the central bank's June and July meetings, should the economy “evolve in line with expectations.”
 But on Friday, the government reported that year-over-year inflation accelerated unexpectedly in May to 8.6%, the highest such level in four decades..The accelerated series of rate hikes now expected from the Fed will increase the likelihood of a recession in the next year or so..“I think they’re going to have to cause a contraction.”
 A key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the Fed to slow inflation to its 2% target, it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending, wage gains and economic growth..Ultimately, the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise — something the Fed hasn't yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue Wednesday..""We believe this shows the Fed is more determined to do what it takes to end the inflation overshoot as rapidly as possible even if that raises the chance of a hard landing in 2023,"" TD Macro said in the report..""In the past, when you've pushed up the unemployment rate, you've almost never been able to avoid a full-fledged recession,"" former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley told CNN..""Admittedly, slowing just enough to cool inflation but not cause a recession is an extremely delicate balancing act given that monetary policy is a blunt instrument, not a surgical tool..“The question is whether the economy can avoid recession and that would depend on what the Fed does..“To restore confidence, central banks need to raise policy rates” sufficiently to bring down inflation, and that “may lead to a further slowdown in the economic recovery,” she said..Powell took until November to “retire” the description of inflation as “transitory” and last month acknowledged that with “hindsight then, yes, it probably would’ve been better to have raised rates earlier.”

And I guess I'm curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it's a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that as you've talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects. And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you, inflation data will tell you when you've gone to where you need to go or do you just feel like maybe it's better to overshoot than to undershoot? So I think the role that we can play, maybe the way to get us to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? So, and we'll be able to see the areas that we can affect are those that are associated with excess demand. And we'll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time. So, and that would tell us what's, that would tell us about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we're seeing, but going forward they would be very important, particularly in the service sector. So, sorry, I'm not sure I'm getting to your question. My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when you're getting to where you need to go or might it lead you to go too far? There's always a risk of going too far or going that far enough. And it's going to be a very difficult judgment to make or maybe not, maybe it'll be really clear. But we're quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which it's not an option. We have to restore price stability. We really do. Because everything, it's the bedrock of the economy. If you don't have price stability, the economy is really not going to work the way it's supposed to. It won't work for people. Their wages will be being eaten up. So, we want to get the job done. This is this inflation happened relatively recently. We don't think that it's affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We don't think that we're seeing a wage price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2%. That's critical. It's absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. That's how we're thinking about it. Brian Chung with Yahoo Finance. I just want to expand on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done. When you talk about consumer sentiment being down, household inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk. Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your explanation of the economy given that the description of inflation, the statement, didn't change between May and June. Thanks. So, clearly, people don't like inflation a lot. Many people are experiencing it really for the first time. We haven't had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years. It's really something people don't like in their experiencing that. That's showing up in their surveys and in all kinds of ways. We understand that. We understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation. We're determined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So, that's really what we're saying. I'm not clearly, it's an incredibly unpopular thing and it's very painful for people. So, I guess what I'm saying is the question, really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and we'll use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that. Chris. Thank you. Chris Regaber and Associated Press. You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns. But aside from rises in commodity prices, such as gas prices, we're also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing, such as the Cleveland Feds median and trimmed means CPIs. How persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation and where do you see those going in the near future? As I mentioned, I think in my opening statement, inflation has started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic related areas and it's spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well. It was really in a good sector at the beginning. In particular, you're seeing in travel now, if you've flown on a plane lately, planes are very full and plane tickets are very expensive. Some of that will be passed through of energy prices, but it's so you're experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is high. So it's a question and you see the Cleveland measure going up and many other measures are going up. So it's a time when we're not seeing progress and we want to see progress and that's really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does is that we see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels which would be in the thinking of the committee somewhere in the range of a three to three and a half percent by year end and then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that's responsive to your question. Nancy. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall Gensner with Marketplace. Do you still think a soft dish landing is possible and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation? So I think what's in the SEP would certainly, certainly, need that test. If you see, you're looking at getting that back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024 and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent, that would be, I would call that as, as meeting that test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there's, I think there's, I don't want to be the handicap or here. I just, that is our objective. I do think it's possible. Like I said though, I think that events of the last few months have raised a degree of difficulty, created great challenges. And again, the answer to the question, can we still do it? There's a much bigger chance now that it'll depend on factors that we don't control, which is, you know, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could, could, could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don't know. But we're, you know, we're focused on very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market, like the one we had before the pandemic. Thank you, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more, you know, economists are worried that you're kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer and that there, now there's even more risk of a recession than, than a 50, 50 path of rates. So could you talk a little bit more about that? And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them? Sure. So as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that's a good thing, we think. But the federal funds rate, even after this increases, is at 1.6 percent. So it's hard to see how that is too high of a rate. And even if we did another, you know, we're, so we're going to get here by the end of the summer somewhere in the twos probably. Still, that's still a low rate. So that's not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on. And we'll, by then we'll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned, a couple times, the committee's views are around a, a modestly restrictive stance, which would be in the three to three and a half percent range by the end of this year. But that's, that's, you know, conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it'll be reflected in our, in our policy. As you see today, you know, we'll be watching if, if things go in a direction we don't expect, then we're going to adapt. And I would say this is a highly uncertain environment, extraordinarily uncertain environment. So again, we'll be, determined and resolved, but flexible. Evan Reiser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell. I was wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation. And will that be shared with the public? And then secondly, given the ill acquitted and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse? Sorry. What was your question on QT? Just given the ill liquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, whether QT will make things worse.

It's hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night. But you have to understand the context. Really the context is this for decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics. Let's call it that globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. And that's how all the models work. Decades and decades of data. They look at that. It's a very flat Phillips curve work and the supply shocks tend to be transient. We have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks if you think about it. The pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by a shutdowns in China. You were in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here. So we're aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy. We have been obviously for quite a while that this is a different, these forces are different. Inflations behaving differently. In our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand, but you couldn't get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that. So that's how we're looking at it. And we've done a lot of work internally on thinking about what all that means. The thing is you don't know whether those forces are to what extent are they going to be sustained. In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on? The history is you see these ways of supply shocks as you did in the 70s and then they go away and there's a new normal and things settle down. But honestly, we don't know what that's going to be. In the meantime, we have to find Christability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where clearly inflationary forces are, you're seeing them everywhere. If you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it's absolutely extraordinary. It's not just here. In fact, we're sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have. And partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered. So that's what we're doing. We've done a lot of introspection and work on that. And sorry, on QT, we've communicated really clearly to the markets about what we're going to do there. The markets seem to be okay with it. We're phasing in. Treasury issuances down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it's been. So I have no reason to think markets are forward looking and they've seen this coming. I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems. It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point. Thanks for the last question. We'll get a mark. Okay, right there. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bank Rate. Wonder what your assessment is about the outlook for the housing market given the years long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates. And all that, of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market, given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago. Thank you. Sure. The rates were very low. A good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could to support the economy went on employment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that. And that was rates are low and now they're coming back up to more normal or above levels. So in the meantime, well rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent, to living in single-family homes in the suburbs famously. And so the demand was just suddenly much higher. And so we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years. So that changes now and rates have moved up. We're well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot and you're seeing a changing housing market. We're watching it to see what will happen. How much will it really affect residential investment? Not really sure. How much will it affect housing prices? Not really sure. It's, obviously, we're watching that quite carefully. You would think over time, so there's a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes. And as those come online, whereas the supply of finished homes, the inventory of finished homes that are for sale is incredibly low, historically low. So that it's still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while, even in a world where rates are up. So it's a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I would say if you're a home buyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgages or mortgage rates are low again. So this will be a process whereby we ideally, we do our work in a way that we're the housing market, settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels. So thank you very much.",0.0084148882851037,0.0086264135872147,72,2022-06-15,True,True,True,True,-0.0063600782778864,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT       June 15, 2022

2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:30:00,2022-09-21 18:40:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. This stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by 3-quarters of a percentage point, and we anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%. In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production. Growth and consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly in large part reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports. As shown in our summary of economic projections, since June, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth standing at just 0.2% this year and 1.2% next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. Despite the slow down in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low. Job vacancies near historical highs and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employee employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per month over the last three months. The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August, but has little changed since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4% at the end of next year, a half percentage point higher than in the June projections. Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer run normal level. Inflation remains well above our 2% longer run goal. Over the 12 months ending in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.6%. In August, the 12 month consumer price index was 8.3%, and the core CPI was 6.3%. Price pressures remained evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.4% this year and falls to 2.8% next year, 2.3% in 2024, and 2% in 2025. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Despite elevated inflation, longer termed inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current amount of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 3.4% of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 3.3% and a quarter percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Overcoming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, consistent with inflation returning to 2%. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate. The pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 4.4% at the end of this year. One percentage point higher than projected in June. The median projection rises to 4.6% at the end of next year and declines 2.9% by the end of 2025. Still above, the median estimate of its longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth, and it will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we're confident the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Gina Smiley from The New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop. So I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done. So the way we're thinking about this is the overarching focus of the committee is getting inflation back down to 2% to accomplish that. We think we'll need to do two things in particular to achieve a period of growth below trend and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply and the labor market. So on the first, committees forecast and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second, though, so far there's only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a bit. As you know, quits are off there all-time highs. There are some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out, but not moving up. Pay roll gains have moderated, but not much. And in light of the high inflation we're seeing, we think we'll need to, and in light of what I just said, we think that we'll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level.",0.0064690937663698,0.0124996717523174,79,2022-09-21,True,True,True,False,-0.0162231981400155,Negative,Positive,"Job gains

 The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation..While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00 per cent-3.25 per cent range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement..“With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed’s commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week..“The economy now faces a serious risk of persistent high inflation.”
 The Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to announce its decision at 1600 GMT Wednesday..The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation..The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.00%-3.25% on Wednesday and signaled more large increases to come in new projections showing its policy rate rising to 4.40% by the end of this year before topping out at 4.60% in 2023 to battle continued strong inflation..The updated statement of economic projections suggest that the Fed is reluctantly, slowly, catching up to reality in terms of their anticipation for everything – for inflation, for core inflation, for GDP..“The Fed is willing to produce a good deal of pain to the economy, and potentially to the stock market in order to rein in the runaway inflation we’ve been seeing this year.”

First, we'll want to see growth continuing to run below trend. We'll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand. And ultimately, we'll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2%. So that's what we'll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we'd want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2% before we would consider that. See. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Steve Leesman, CNBC. Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rate should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Or can you envision a time when there's a pause to kind of look at what has been brought in the economy from the rate increases? Thank you. Sure. So of course, monetary policy does famously work with long and variable lags. The way I think of it is our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions. Then changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly within a few months. But it's likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I noted in my opening remarks that at some point as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that's how we think about that. Your second question, sorry, was. Is there a point in time you could see pausing? Is it linear that you keep raising rates or is there? Oh, sorry. I should know better than to not talk with my microphone. I should know better than to answer your second question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy, the rate increase, time to catch up in the real economy. Thank you. So I think it's very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2% where we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SCP numbers is people's views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those will evolve over time. And I think we'll just have to see how that goes. There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we're confident in and stay there for a time. But we're not at that level. Clearly today, we've just moved, I think, probably into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive. And certainly, in my view, in the view of the committee, there's a ways to go. You're right, Bill. All right, sure, Paul. Rachel Siegel from Washington Post, thank you for taking our questions. The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% next year. And historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it. Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing? And is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down? Right, so you're right. And in the SEP, there's what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So really, that is what we generally expect. Because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways. And I'll mention a couple of those. First, and you know these. But first, job openings are incredibly high, relative to the number of people looking for work. It's plausible. I'll say that job openings could come down significantly, and they need to, without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that's one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored. And as I've said, there's no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the third thing I would point to that's different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we've had beginning with the pandemic and really with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation. So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles. And in principle, if those things start to get better, and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that, it's not much more than that, but it's good to see that. For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now, supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events, it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline a rather increase in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging. And we don't know. No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be. That's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also do we get more labor supply, which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless, we're committed to getting inflation back down to 2%, because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on. Just a little bit more on soft landing. Are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes. Vacancies are still almost 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people. That's that in quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, which where generally the unemployment rate itself is a single best indicator. We think those things have for quite a time now. Really added value in terms of understanding what the labor market is. Nick. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal, you said not too long ago in describing the policy destination, there's still a way to go. But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you're thinking about your destination, whether it's a stopping point or a pausing point. And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about as the data come in, where that destination is, how it's moving up if inflation doesn't perform as you expect. Do you want to have a policy rate that's above the underlying inflation rate, for example? And do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now? Well, so again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive. And by that I mean is meaningfully putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. That's what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also know that there are long and variable ranks, particularly as they relate to inflation. So it's a challenging assessment. So what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions. As you know, you look at where rates are real and nominal in some cases. You look at credit spreads. You look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think, and you see this in the, is this something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings? And you see this, I think, in the committee forecast. You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve. And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we're writing down and think about, you measure those against some sort of forward looking assessment of inflation expectations. I think you would see at that time you'd see positive real rates across the yield curve. And that is also an important consideration. Power. Hi, Howard Schneider with Rotors. Thanks for the opportunity. I just want to be clear on this steps. You say it's meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we're going 75, 50, 25. Is 75 next month the baseline? So we make one decision for meeting and the meeting decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75.

 The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation..While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00 per cent-3.25 per cent range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement..“With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed’s commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week..“They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.”
 Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. central bank to eventually need to raise its policy rate to around 5.00 per cent, a level approaching the peak of 5.25 per cent seen from mid-2006 to 2007 when Fed policymakers were concerned about a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and one that could amplify stress across the global financial system..“This is what will drive the markets, not the rate hike… but what the Fed plans to do next.”
 Fed officials have for months stuck to the mantra that they will only ease up on their hawkish drive when inflation comes down and remains subdued..WASHINGTON, United States—The Federal Reserve is poised to roll out another big increase in interest rates Wednesday as it tries to cool the economy to tamp down the highest inflation in 40 years, but recession fears are rising..ADVERTISEMENT
 Many economists are expecting a third straight three-quarter point rate hike when the meeting concludes Wednesday, which would be an unprecedented action since that era..His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months — or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it's convinced that inflation is on its way down..In a further sign of the Fed's deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year's end than it had forecast three months ago — and to keep them higher for longer..Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed's goal is to achieve a “soft landing,"" by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession..The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation..Investors will study the central bank’s projections to try and predict future rate hikes and to gauge how policy officials expect their actions to impact the economy..WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - How much faith Federal Reserve officials still have in prospects for a ""soft landing"" as they take aggressive action to quash the highest inflation in 40 years will be revealed on Wednesday when the central bank releases fresh policymaker forecasts..Later on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame inflation..Beyond that, investors will be focused on what Powell has to say, both in the Fed's latest interest rate policy statement and during an afternoon press conference, for clues as to whether the central bank remains primarily focused on lowering inflation, or if there's a hint the Fed is giving more consideration to the impact of higher rates on the economy..Inflation is seen slowly returning to the Fed's 2% target in 2025..What it's telling us is that the Fed is expecting to rates to continue to move higher into 2023."".He will continue to pull his inner Paul Volcker and stress how important it is to bring inflation under control, even if it potentially slows the economy and causes pain for most consumers.”

But there's also, there's another fairly large group that saw 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be 25 basis points less. So we're going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn't make that decision today. We didn't vote on that. I would say that we're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly. And that's what we're thinking about. So just as a follow up to that, I'm wondering about this sort of risk management considerations you're given. There's some discussion now of overdoing ahead. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is? So what we've seen is inflation has. Our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down largely because of supply side healing. By now, we would have thought that we've who have seen some of that. We haven't. We have seen some supply side healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a three, six, and 12 month trailing annualized basis, you'll see that inflation is at 4.8%, 4.5%, and 4.8%. So that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can keep doing these. And we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to. And we're still discovering what that level is. But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be. So that's how we're thinking about it. It's going to call me. Thank you. COVID is moving to the financial times. Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025? And yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024. And does that mean there's a level of inflation above the 2% target that the Fed is willing to tolerate? So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025 and the median. And headline is at 2.0. So that's pretty close. I mean, we write down our forecasts and we figure out what the median is and we publish it. So I would say that if actually if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome. But you're right, it is a 10 higher than 2%. Just as a quick follow up, I mean, if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched perhaps each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increased today and does that risk having to do more later on? Yeah, so as we said, at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in. So if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August. So I think you can't really never want to over-react too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together, and as I just mentioned, if you really, really look at this year's inflation, 3, 6, and 12 month railing, you see inflation is running too high. It's running 4.5% or above. You don't need to know much more than that. If that's the one thing you know, you know that this committee is committed to getting to a, you know, meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. So that's how we think about it. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, Guido with Politico. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet. You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed securities, but we've seen significant slowing in the housing market mortgage rates have gone up significantly. And I'm just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for how quickly you have the runoff on the NBS side? So what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well underway, I would say it's not something we're considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term. It's just something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close. Well, and will conditions in the housing market affect that decision? I think a number of things might affect that decision, but the main thing is we're not considering that decision, and I don't expect that we will anytime soon. Thanks. Neil Erwin with Axios. A number of commentators have come to the view, including over the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a global recession that's worse than is necessary to bring inflation down. How do you see that risk? How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers? And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level? So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world. We are in pretty regular contact and we exchange, of course, we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives, in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment price stability. But we regularly discuss what we're seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers. And it's a very ongoing constant kind of a process. So we are very aware of what's going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us and vice versa. The forecast that we put together, that our staff puts together and that we put together on our own always take all of that, try to take all of that into account. I mean, I can't say that we do it perfectly, but it's not as if we don't think about the policy decisions, monetary policy and otherwise, the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have effect on the U.S. economy. That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy as best we can. It won't be perfect. So, you know, I don't see it, it's hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates. If you remember, they were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times. But really, really, we're all, we're in very different situations. But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing and it's not coordination, but there's a lot of information sharing and we all, I think, are informed by what, by what other important economies and cognizant of the importance of the United States are doing. Craig. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we've also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits. And I'm wondering what your story is on the resilience of the economy. After all, you and your colleagues said, well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future and indeed treasury rates moved up. So, we should have had a lot of tightening, taking effect. Why is the economy in your view so resilient and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate? You're right, of course. Labor market in particular has been very strong. But there are the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate-sensitive, our sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening. And of course, the obvious example is housing where you see declining activity and all different kinds and how price increase is moving down. So we're having an effect on interest-sensitive spending. I think through exchange rates, we're having an effect on exports and imports. So all of that's happening. But you're right, and we've said this. This is a strong robust economy. People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn't spend and where they were getting government transfers. They're still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum, but still some savings out there to support growth. The states are very flush with cash. So there's good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now, the data, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend issue. We think of trend as being about 1.8% in that range. We're forecasting growth well below that and most forecasters are. But you're right. There's certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that. And that's a good thing because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn. But of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2%. We can't fail to do that. I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve.",0.0027429872683987,0.0074249071886601,81,2022-09-21,True,True,False,False,-0.0162231981400155,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT  September 21, 2022

In a world of euphemisms that we live in here with below trend growth and modest increase in unemployment, I'm wondering if I could ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people. Do the odds now favor given where you are and where you're going with interest rates favor a recession? 4.4% unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs, is that acceptable job loss? And then given that the data you look at is backward looking and the lags in your policy are forward looking and you don't know what they are, how will you know or will you know if you've gone too far? So I don't know what the odds are. I think that there's a very high likelihood that we'll have a period of what I've mentioned is below trend growth by which I mean much lower growth. And we're seeing that now. So the median forecast I think this year for among my colleagues and me was 0.2% growth. So that's very slow growth. And then below trend next year I think the median was 1.2 also well below. So that's a slower, that's a very slow level of growth and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think that's, so that is something that we think we need to have and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. You know, we're never going to say that there are too many people working but the real point is this inflation. What we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation. And if we want to set ourselves up really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't. So what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we're putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. And that's what we're doing. And we don't certainly don't hope. We certainly haven't given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task. But how will you know or will you know if you've gone too far? Hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean, our again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be. And as I said, you can look at this SEP as today's estimate of where we think those rates would be, of course, they will evolve over time. Chris, we're neighbor. Thanks, Chris. We're neighbor at the associated price. I wanted to follow up with what you just mentioned about the labor market. You've said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability. And you've suggested maybe there isn't a trade off in the long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern as people have been expressing here about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes. So can you explain though what about high inflation now, or threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to suggest that inflation, high inflation will eventually be to a weaker job market. So can you spell that out a little more for the general public and how that will work? So for starters, people are seeing their wage increases. Their wage increases are eaten up by inflation. So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they've been going up, you're in trouble right away. You don't have a cushion. And this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that's what we're hearing from people is very much that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation? And as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn't. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment. And the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully we do that by slowing the economy. And we see some softening in labor market conditions and we see a big contribution from supply side improvements and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed. In any case, our job is to deliver price stability. And I think you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time. We really saw that for a long time. The United States had 2% inflation, didn't move around much. And that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve. And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is you're just postponing the record shows that if you postpone that delay is only likely to lead to more pain. So I think we're moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs. And that's what you see us doing. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. I had a Lawrence for Fox Business. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain? How long? I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and more than that prices to come down for inflation to come down. And what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that. And I think once you're on that path, that's a good thing. And things will start to feel better to people. They'll feel lower inflation. They'll feel the economy is improving. And also, if our projections are close to right, you'll see that the costs in unemployment are, they're meaningful. And they're certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But at the same time, we'd be setting the economy up for another long period. This era has been noted for very long expansions. We've had three of the four longest in measured history since we got inflation under control. And that's not an accident. So when inflation is low in stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11, 10 year anyway, expansions. And you can see what we saw in 2018 and 2019 and 20, which was very low unemployment. The biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we've seen in, since we started keeping track of that. So we want to get back to that, but to get there, we're going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment. And that's going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time. As a foe, what is that economic pain in your mind? Is it job losses? Is it of higher interest rates on credit cards? What is that economic pain? So it's all of those things. Higher interest rates, slower growth and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve. But they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability. And then having to come back and do it down the road again. And doing it at a time when actually now people have really come to expect, you know, high inflation. If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people's economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability, the cost of getting back to price stability just rises. And so we want to avoid that. We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it's done. Nicole, we'll see that. Thank you, Chairman. Paul, Nicole, good kind, CNN business. Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008. Yet mortgage demand increased this week, and housing prices are still elevated. Now at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the housing market. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say reset and what you think it will take to actually get there. So when I say reset, I'm not looking at a particular specific set of data or anything. What I'm really saying is that we've had a time of a red hot housing market all over the country where famously houses were selling to the first buyer at 10% above the ask before even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the deceleration and housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals. And you know, that's a good thing for the longer term. What we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level. At a reasonable pace and that people can afford houses again. And I think we so we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction to get back to that place. There's also longer run issues though with the housing market. As you know, we're, you know, it's.",-0.0046708472039431,0.006536286766613,82,2022-09-21,True,True,False,False,-0.0162231981400155,Negative,Negative,"﻿For release at 2 p.m. EDT  September 21, 2022

 Most analysts are predicting that the Fed will announce another 75 basis-point lift, though some have tipped a full percentage-point move..""If inflation is really stubborn and stays high, they may just have to grit their teeth and have a recession that lasts for a while,"" said Bill English, a professor at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed economist..Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed's goal is to achieve a ""soft landing,"" by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession..""They're going try to avoid recession,"" said William Dudley, formerly the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York..If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4 per cent by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4 per cent that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment..“With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed’s commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week..“They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.”

So builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance. I want to talk to Shelter. Shelter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw. Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months? Or do you think that there's still this imbalance that needs to be addressed? I think that Shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen. So it may take some time. So I think that I think hope for the best plan for the worst. So I think on Shelter inflation, you just got to assume that it's going to remain pretty high for a while. Okay, we'll go to Jean for the last question. Hi, Jean, young with market news. You've talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory. And you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now. So I'm curious how restrictive is rates at 4.6% expected? Is that expected to be next year? How restrictive? So I think if you look, if we let's assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely, what you're going to do is you're going to adjust that for some forward measure, looking measure of inflation. And that could be, you pick your measure. It could be, there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get. But what you'll get is a positive number. In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term. I think that are going to be assuming that we're doing our jobs appropriately. That will be significant. So you'll have a positive federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1% or so. But I mean, I don't know exactly what it would be. But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level. And let me say, we've written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to restore price stability. So this is something that, as you can see, they've moved up. And we're going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go.

2022-12-14 19:30:00,2022-12-14 19:30:00,2022-12-14 19:40:00," Good afternoon. Before I go into the details of today's meeting, I'd like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. For the course of the year, we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by a half percentage point. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. I'll have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Although real GDP rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three quarters of this year. In addition, indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. As shown in our summary of economic projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.5 percent this year and next well below the median estimate of a longer run normal growth rate. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains have slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. The firm C participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year. Conflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent. In November, the 12 month change in the CPI was 7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent. The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. But it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to upward pressure on inflation. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 5.6 percent this year and falls 3.1 percent next year. 2.5 percent in 2024 and 2.1 percent in 2025. Participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. That is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a half percentage point, bringing the target range to 4 and a quarter to 4 and a half percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4 and a quarter percentage points this year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Over the course of the year, financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions. Financial conditions fluctuate in the short-term in response to many factors, but it is important that over time they reflect a policy restraint that we are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent. We are seeing the effects on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step down from the 75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings. Of course, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go. As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, a half percentage point higher than projected in September. The median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer run value. Of course, these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Storing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. This historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I will look forward to your questions. Steve Leesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You just talked about the importance of market conditions, reflecting the policy restraint you put in place. Since the November meeting, the 10-year has declined by 60 basis points. The mortgage rates have come down. High yield credit spreads have come in. The economy has accelerated and the stock market is up 6%. Is this loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed and its effort and it's fighting against inflation? And if so, do you need to do something about that and how would you do something about that? Thank you. So as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect",-0.0057471264367816,0.0105725316040473,89,2022-12-14,True,True,True,False,-0.0090668774859795,Negative,Negative,"Job gains have

 After four straight three-quarter-point interest rate hikes, the Federal Reserve is set to announce a smaller half-point increase in its key rate Wednesday, a first step toward dialling back its efforts to combat inflation..The Fed’s decision Wednesday will follow a government report Tuesday that provided hopeful signs that inflation is finally easing from chronically high levels..Investors expect to see central banks deliver smaller rate hikes for the first time in months, as inflation is showing signs of having peaked and, as a result, the U.S. dollar has retreated..Fed policymakers have lifted borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades this year to slow demand in the economy, hoping to tamp down inflationary pressures and prevent rapid increases from becoming a permanent feature of the American economy..The central bank is expected to deliver a half percentage point hike at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00 p.m..“The Fed is still going to focus on the labor market imbalance, a dovish pivot is still a long way off, and in the meantime, companies and consumers have to recalibrate to the impact of higher interest rates and a slowing economy,” Ma added..Follow her on Twitter @alexandraandnyc

 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by half a point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, an indication that the central bank is pulling back on its aggressive stance as signs begin to emerge that inflation may be easing..Washington, DC CNN —
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by half a point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, an indication that the central bank is pulling back on its aggressive stance as signs begin to emerge that inflation may be easing..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed last month that smaller rate hikes could be expected, saying: “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”
 The latest inflation reading, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, showed year-on-year price increases slowed to 7.1% in November..​”We expect Fed Chair Powell will insist on the need to hold policy at a restrictive level for some time to bring inflation down toward the 2% target,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, in a note to clients Monday.",0.6935,"{

2022-12-14 19:30:00,2022-12-14 19:40:00,2022-12-14 19:50:00," policy restraint that we're putting in place to bring inflation down to 2%. We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year, but our policy actions work through financial conditions and those in turn affect economic activity, the labor market and inflation. So what we control is our policy moves and the communications that we make. Financial conditions both anticipate and react to our actions. I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves. And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time. I would say it's our judgment today that we're not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate. And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be. As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5% or more in the fives. So that's our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be. You will also know that at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we've actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be. And today, the SEP that we're published shows that again, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside. So I can't tell you confidently that we won't move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next SEP. I don't know what we'll do. It will depend on future data. What we're writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that that peak rate will be based on what we know. Obviously, if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up, and it could move down if inflation data are softer. Gina's my lucky New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the Fed will be making another 3.25 percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023. I wonder if you would foresee that being in 25 basis point increments, 50 basis point increments, how you see the speed playing out going forward. And then I wonder what you're looking at as you determine when to stop. As I've been saying, as we've gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year, and we saw that the how strong inflation was now persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed, the pace with which we're moving was the most important thing. I think now that we're coming to the end of this year, we've raised 425 basis points this year, and we're into restrictive territory. It's now not so important how fast we go. It's far more important to think what is the ultimate level. And then at a certain point, the question will become how long do we remain restrictive. That will become the most important question. But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed. So in that applies to February as well. So I think we'll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial conditions, where we see the economy. And that'll be the key thing. But I mean for that decision. But ultimately, that question about how high the raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. I've told you today we have an assessment that we're not as restrictive enough stance even with today's move. And we've laid out our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there. At a certain point, though, we'll get to that point. And then the question will be how long do we stay there? And there the strong view on the committee is that we'll need to stay there until we're really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way. And we think that that will be some time. Now, why do I say that? If you look at the, you can break inflation down into three sort of buckets. The first is goods inflation. And we see now, as we've been expecting really for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better. And ultimately, supply chains get fixed and demand settles down a little bit. And maybe goes back to services a little bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We're now starting to see that in this report and the last one. Then you go to housing services. We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high. And we'll continue to go up actually as rates as rents expire and have to be renewed. They're going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed. But we see that the new leases that are, that the rate for new leases is coming down. So once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will come down sometime next year. The third piece, which is something like 55% of the index, PCE and core inflation index, is non-housing related core services. And that's really a function of a labor market, largely at the biggest cost by far in that sector. It's labor. And we, you know, we do see a very, very strong labor market. One where we haven't seen much softening where job growth is very high, where wages are very high. Vacancies are quite elevated. And really there's an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. The other, you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half now it seems to be turning. But there's an expectation really that the services inflation will not move down so quickly so that we'll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that's really why we are writing down those high rates and why we're expecting that they'll have to remain high for a time. Howard Schneider with Reuters, thanks for taking the question. You described GDP growth in the steps as moderate or modest, I believe. Yet it's really approaching stall speed. Half a percentage point is not much. You described labor market unemployment rate as representing some softening, but it's nearly a full percentage point rise and that's well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession. Why wouldn't this be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed? Well, I'll tell you what the projection is. I don't think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you've got positive growth. The expectations in the SEP are basically, as you said, which is we've got growth at a modest level, which is to say about a half a percentage point. That's positive growth. It's slow growth. It's well below trend. It's not going to feel like a boom. It's going to feel like very slow growth. In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit. Unemployment does go up a bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment. It's not clear that those forecasts or inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision, but that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market. If you look, the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is a story unto itself. Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it's been very, very hard to hire. You've got all these vacancies out there far in excess of the number of employed people. That doesn't sound like a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work. They're channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe. None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects. Thanks, Nick Timmerow, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on Gina's question. The decision to step down the pace of rate increases. Rate rises. Appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the committee's forecast this year. You just now talked about making decisions, meeting by meeting, and being mindful of the lags of policy. Does that mean all things equal? You would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting. I haven't made a judgment on what size rate hike to make it to last meeting, but what you said is broadly right, which is having moved so quickly and having so much restraint that's still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace. That will allow us to feel our way and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face. That's the idea. It makes a lot of sense. It seems to me, particularly if you consider how far we've come. But again, I can't tell you today what the actual size of that will be. It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions. Would the CPI report that come out last week, do you think it would change some of those forecasts today's SEP? No, absolutely not. No, just a matter of practice, the SEP reftomation.",0.0016082826556767,0.0083629310561978,90,2022-12-14,True,False,False,False,-0.0090668774859795,Negative,Positive,"﻿For release at 2:00 p.m. EST                    December 14, 2022

And participants know that they have the, they know this, that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, well in advance of the press conference so that we're not running around. But that's not the case. It's never the case that the SEPs don't reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting. Thanks, Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. I'm wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate. Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection? Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment rate? Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn't quite as strong as we think it is now? Thanks. No, it's not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market is clearly very strong. It is more just that by now we had expected, we've continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have ultimately. And that's why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You see the fact that we've made less progress and expected on inflation. So that's why that goes up. And that's why unemployment goes up because we're having to tighten policy more. And so it didn't go up by much in the media, I don't think, but that's the idea. Is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer, just to get to where the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2%. Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming or changes to the labor force population, right? It's very hard to say, you can look at history, right? In history would say that in a situation like this, the declines and unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there. But why do we think that is the case? So I'll give you a few reasons. First just is that there's this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount. And we're hearing from many companies that they don't want to lay people off. So that they'll keep people because it's been so hard. I think it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there, where there are four million fewer people, a little more than four million who are in the workforce available to work, then there's demand for workforce. So the fact that there's a strong labor market means that companies will hold onto workers and it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less. Again, that we're going to find out empirically, but I think that's a reasonably possible outcome. And you do hear many, many labor economists believe that it is. So we'll see you though. Colby. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 and the SEP? Does that not then suggest that the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 medium estimate penciled in? Well, I think that's why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year. Came in stronger this year. Yeah, what you see is our best estimate as of today, really, as of today, for how high we need to raise rates to how much we need to tighten policy to create enough. You know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels. That's that's that's that is the estimate best estimate we make today. And as I mentioned, we'll make another estimate for the next SEP and we'll, you know, of course, between meetings we do the same thing, but we don't publish it. Victoria. Hi, Victoria. We know with Politico. I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what's going on in the SEP because you all expect rates to go higher, but you're also more pessimistic about what inflation is going to look like next year. And I was just wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it is that primarily because of wage growth that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwind? We're going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right? So we're actually moving down to the level that we're moving down to next year. Still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now. Well, more than a 1% change in inflation. But remember that the jump off point at the beginning of the year is higher. So we're moving down still by a very large chunk. I don't think it's having I don't think the policies having any less effect is just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022. So we're getting down I believe the median is 3.5%. That would be that's a pretty significant drop in inflation. And you know, where's it coming from? It's coming from it's coming from the good sector clearly. By the middle of next year, we should begin to see a lower inflation from the housing services sector. And then, you know, the big question is when we how much will you see from the largest the 55% of the index, which is the non housing services sector? And you know, that's that's where you need to see we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market. So that you have it's it's not that we don't want wage increases. We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation. Right now that if you put into if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates. Wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2% inflation. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell, Neil, Neil Irwin with Axios. Some of your colleagues have been pretty explicit that they can't imagine rate cuts happening in 2023. That certainly not implied by the SEP. But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back half of next year. What's your view of the likelihood of any kind of rate cuts next year? What circumstances might make that plausible? You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to do. Assure a return of inflation to our 2% goal over time. It's not on rate cuts. And we think that we'll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time. Historical experience caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I guess I would say it this way. I wouldn't see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way. So that's the test I would articulate. And you're correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Let me ask you about China in the last few weeks. China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty strongly. I'm wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you're seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally and proves the global outlook for growth and for commodity prices. So you're right. Those two things will offset each other. We could weaker output in China. We'll push down on commodity prices. But it could interfere with supply chains ultimately. And that could push inflation up in the West. It's very hard to say how much those two will offset each other. And it doesn't seem likely actually that the overall net effect would be material on us. But to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening. We've seen waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity. China is a very critical manufacturing place for the country. It's a place for manufacturing and exporting. Their supply chain is very important. And China faces a reopening. They've backed away from their COVID restriction policies that could be very significant increases in COVID. And we'll just have to see it's a risky situation. But again, it doesn't seem like it's likely to have material overall effects on us. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruegeber, associated press. Thank you for taking my question. I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday's inflation report. I mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings. Are you starting to see? Are you confident that you're seeing real progress on getting inflation under control? Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, upward spiral? Thank you. Right. So the data that we've received so far for October and November, we don't have the, some of the, we have some remaining data to get in November. But they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. So the way we think about this is this. This report is very much in line with what we've been expecting and hoping for. And what it does is it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation. As I mentioned, we've been expecting significant forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year. And this is the kind of reading that it will take to to support that. So really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecast rather than at this point changing our forecast. In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting a good news.",0.0007024938531788,0.0047187024197506,91,2022-12-14,False,False,False,False,-0.0090668774859795,Negative,Positive,"Job gains have

 After four straight three-quarter-point interest rate hikes, the Federal Reserve is set to announce a smaller half-point increase in its key rate Wednesday, a first step toward dialling back its efforts to combat inflation..Despite Powell’s recent hard-line remarks – he said late last month that “we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation” – he and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re ready to dial down the pace of rate hikes..Three months ago, the Fed’s policy-makers estimated that the unemployment rate would rise to 4.4 per cent next year, from 3.7 per cent now..On Wednesday, the policy-makers may forecast a higher unemployment rate by the end of 2023..U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference after Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in Washington, September 21, 2022..One area where markets are looking for change is in phrasing saying the FOMC ""anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate"" to something more generic like ""some increases"" could be needed..Officials will also release a fresh set of economic projections, their first since September, which will offer a glimpse at how high they expect rates to rise in 2023 and how long they plan to hold them there..Economic projections from policymakers and the latest dot plot showing each member’s forecast for the U.S. short-term interest rate will also serve as guidance to investors on the Federal Reserve’s path forward..“It’s all a balancing act, which we believe points to near-term choppy markets even though the improving inflation backdrop adds a positive bias.”

 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by half a point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, an indication that the central bank is pulling back on its aggressive stance as signs begin to emerge that inflation may be easing..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed last month that smaller rate hikes could be expected, saying: “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”

Housing services, as I mentioned, there is good news in the pipeline as long as housing, new housing leases show declining inflation that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year, so that should help. And the big piece again is Core Services X Housing, which is very important. And we have a ways to go there. You do see some beginning signs there, but ultimately that's the big that more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE Core Index. And it's very fundamentally about the labor market and wages. If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last pay rolls report. You don't really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now there may be composition effects and other effects in that. So we don't put too much weight on any one report. These things can be volatile month to month, but we'll be looking for wages moving down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and ultimately their gains are not being eaten up by inflation. Michael, excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio on television. There's a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just expressed about the economy and the changes that you've made in the set. And I'm wondering if you're reacting to the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions, or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether in the recent disinflation we're seeing is transitory or not. And how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you're projecting just half a percent growth for this year? So if I think I got your question. So one thing is to say is I think our policies in getting into a pretty good place now were restrictive and I think we're getting close to that level of sufficient. We think sufficiently restrictive. We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there. And I mean it boils down to how long do we think this process is going to take. And of course we're welcome. These better inflation reports for the last two months. They're very welcome. But I think we're realistic about the broader project. So that's all that's the point I would make. It's you know we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen with housing services. But the big story will really be the rest of it. And there's not much progress there. And that's going to take some time. I think my view and my colleagues view is that this will take some time. We'll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that you know two good, you know two good monthly reports are you know very welcome. Of course they're very welcome. But we need to be honest with ourselves that there's you know inflation 12 month core inflation is 6% CPI. That's three times our 2% target. Now it's it's good to see progress but let's just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability. What do you think the soft landing is no longer a human? No I wouldn't say that. No I don't say that. I mean I would say this you know to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation you know moves up higher and higher I think that that narrow is the runway. But lower inflation readings if they persist in time could could certainly make it more possible. So I just I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to have a recession or not. And if we do whether it's going to be a deep one or not. It's just it's not knowable. And certainly you know lower inflation reports were they to continue for a period of time would would increase the likelihood of of a so I would put it this way of a return to price stability that involves significantly less. Less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given historical record. Hi, Chairman Powell. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Chong NBC news. You warned Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed likes rates but with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that just wondering where we are in that pain how would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves that would be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs. So the the largest amount of pain the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time. The kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn't respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode you know 50 years ago. So that's really the worst pain would be if we failed to act. What we're doing now is you know it's raising interest rates for people and so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing there will be some softening in labor market conditions and I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability there isn't and this is the best we can do. I do I do think though that and markets are pretty confident it seems to me that we will get inflation under control and I believe we will we're certainly highly committed to do that. Thank you Mr. Chair. Grady Trimble with Fox Business. You've reiterated today and the committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2% inflation target. I wonder is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is. That's just so changing our inflation goal is just something we're not we're not thinking about it's not something we're not going to think about it's we have a 2% inflation goal and we'll use our tools to get inflation back to 2%. I think this isn't the time to be thinking about that. I mean there may be a longer run project at some point but that is not where we are at all the committee we're not considering that we're not going to consider that under any circumstances we're going to we're going to keep our inflation target at 2% and we're going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2%. Nicole. Thank you Chairman Powell. Nicole good kinds of data. Thank you. You know what I think you're going to do is we're going to do this with the $2,000,000 in our business. As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you're paying close attention to a sector or even income level. How do you factor potential exacerbations of inequality into your calculations, especially given that to the labor market that we had in 2018, 1920. So what that looked like was wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest, the gaps between between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history. That's all of that because of a tight labor market. A tight labor market which which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2% in the economy growing right at its potential. So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country if we could get back to that. And so that's what all of us want to do. We want to get back to us to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of time. That's a really good thing for workers in the economy and we'd love to get back to that. That's what our goal is. You know, there's in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability. But we can't, what we have to think about is the medium and longer term. If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time. I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here. But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity. So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over very, very long period of time. And so when it is lost for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible, which is what we're doing. In the short term, are you back during the disaster, labor, potential, evacuation, We do. Yes, we absolutely do. We look at, it's our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing. We do. We keep our eye on that. Nancy. Hi, Nancy Marshall, Gensers with Marketplace. What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter recession before we see strong, consistent signs that inflation is slowing? In other words, stagflation. So I don't want to get into too many hypotheticals, but we'll, it's hard to deal with hypotheticals. So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability. I've made it clear that right now the labor market is very, very strong.

Where we're missing is on the inflation side, and we're missing by lot on the inflation side. So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that's what we'll do. I think as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play. But right now, clearly the focus has to be on getting inflation down. Great. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. You spoke a little bit ago. You said that the US looks like we have a structural labor shortage in the economy. Could you expand on that? Talk a little bit more about that. And really are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing like legal immigration, things like that? Thank you. So what I meant by that, the structural labor shortage is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working, and then you can take supply of labor by are you in the labor market? Are you looking for a job or have a job? And you're more than 4 million people short. We don't see, despite very high wages in an incredibly tight labor market, we don't see participation moving up, which is contrary to what we thought. So the upshot of all that is the labor market is actually, it's 3 1.5 million people, at least, smaller than it should have been, based on pre-pandemic, just assume population and reasonable growth in aging of the population, our labor force should be 3 1 1 2 1,5 million more than it is. And there are lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements. People dropped out and aren't coming back at a higher rate than expected. Part of it is that we lost 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 And part of it is that migration has been lower. We don't prescribe. It's not our job to prescribe things. But I think if you ask businesses pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren't enough people, we need more people. So I tried to identify that in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do. Because they gave us a job, and we need to do that job. Thanks. Jennifer? Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Sean Burger with Yahoo Finance. You say you expect growth of just half a percent next year. Given that you've said the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful. Have you had discussions within the committee and addressed how long and or how deep of a recession you would be willing to accept? No, I mean what we do is we make we make our forecasts and we publish them quarterly. And if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean unemployment goes up, but not a great deal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up, a lot of you see inflation coming down. Those are those forecasts. And that's really what they show. We're not, of course, we don't talk about this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession. We just, we make those forecasts. The staff runs, and you will see this if you look at the old teal books, runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those two. And those will explore different things. But that's just, you know, upcycling downcyde scenarios. Of course, that's responsible practice that we've carried on for many decades. But no, we don't, we haven't asked ourselves that question. Good, a G for the last question. Hi, G and Young with Market News. I wanted to ask about the SAP again. If you are reaching peak rates around 5% in the first half of next year and inflation starts to decline materially, that would seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive. Is that something that's built into the projections and into models? Is that something you would want to see? So we do know that, of course, that's something that we know and we'd see. But as I mentioned, we wouldn't, I wouldn't see the committee cutting rates until we're confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way. That would be my test. I don't see us as having a really clear, precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that would mechanically happen like that. It would really, it'll be a test of, for cutting rates, I think in the event, it'll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way?

2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:40:00," Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Over the past year we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. In addition we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Storing price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 1%. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Under-spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing the labor market continues to be out of balance. Their demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in December total PCE prices rose 5.0%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.4%. The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And while recent developments are encouraging we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to a returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal front's rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.5 to 4.3 quarters percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal front's rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. People take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step down from last year's rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, as we determine the extent of future increases that we required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by taking into account the totality of incoming data and the implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Chris. Good game. Chris Rugeber to the Associated Press. Thank you for doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which is also brought down mortgage rates and the stock market posted a solid game in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder and could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in or to offset the easing of financial conditions? So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy or strength that we're putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2%. And of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we're not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things affect financial conditions, not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we said policy. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter, we've seen a deceleration in prices, in wages and a fall in consumer spending. All while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low, does this at all change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up at all to see inflation come down to the levels you're looking for? So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage. What you see is really in the good sector, you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services and shortages or have been abated.

 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..The Fed is widely seen as raising its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in its first policy meeting of the year, after the rapid increases in 2022 to tame decades-high inflation..Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and is expected to announce another rate increase later Wednesday..The markets are widely expecting the central bank to slow down its pace of rate hikes to a 25 basis point increase today..""The last time we had a big round of central bank meetings like this in December, the rate hikes themselves were much as expected, but the hawkish rhetoric alongside them led to a big selloff,"" Reid said..Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and was expected to announce another rate increase later Wednesday..The central bank is hoping to cool the job market and ease upward pressure on wages that feed into inflation..The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication that it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle..The Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s..The post-meeting statement noted that inflation ""has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" a tweak on previous language..Otherwise, the statement remained intact from previous messages as the Fed continues its efforts to arrest inflation..Fed officials have remained resolute about tackling inflation, though they have said recent numbers show pressures could be easing..Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation..Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working..The central bank is expected to raise its short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point, a slowing of last year's aggressive pace of hikes..Traditionally the Fed raises interest rates by quarter percentage point increments, but persistently high inflation pushed it to act more aggressively..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..Policy-makers are adamant they will not make what they consider to be the crucial error of pausing further rate hikes until they are convinced inflation is on a durable path back to the 2 per cent goal..“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..With the careful communication path Powell must walk in mind, here's what to expect when the FOMC's post-meeting statement is released at 2 pm ET:

 Over the past few weeks, Fed officials have been explicit in stating that, at the very least, they can start approving smaller moves than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases approved in 2022..Now that inflation pressures have eased in recent months, consumer spending and hiring have slowed, and wage increases have moderated, many analysts believe the central bank could even stop raising rates — and possibly cut them later this year..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..Policymakers are unlikely to declare victory in their inflation fight just yet..The Fed wants to cool hiring and wage increases, which can drive up inflationary pressures.",0.6832,"{

So we'll update those forecasts in March. Neil. Hi Chair Powell, Neil or one of the axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December Jolt's morning job openings actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? So you're right about the data of course. We did see, we've seen our jar early earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number in Jolt's has been quite volatile recently and I did see that it moved up back up this morning. I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio I guess is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, nonetheless you're right. We do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market you still see very high payroll job creation and quits are still at an elevated level. So by many, many indicators the job market is still very strong. Colby and then how is it? Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the economic data since the December meeting is the trajectory for the Fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guide post for the policy path forward or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now. So you're right at the December meeting we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be and that's obviously back in December and the median for that was between five and five and a quarter percent. At the March meeting we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe on going rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to two percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground and financial additions of certainly tightened. I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we're writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to move rates up beyond what we said in December we would certainly do that. At the same time if the data come in in the other direction then we'll make data dependent decisions at coming meetings of course. Just as a quick follow up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in six or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage. Whereas we have no incentive in the desire to over tighten. But if we feel like we've gone too far we can certainly, because the concern and inflation is coming down faster than we expect then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that in this situation where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years the job is not fully done. As I mentioned, I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that is 56% of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it. It's not happening yet. Inflation in the core services X housing is still running at 4% on a 6 and 12 month basis. So there's nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing less than 50%, you actually I think now have a story that is credible that's coming together. Although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline. So for the third sector we don't see anything here. So I think it would be premature. We very premature to declare victory or to think that we've really got this. We need to see our goal of course is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector. And they should be coming into play to have inflation, the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But so far we don't see that. And I think until we do, we say ourselves it's having a lot of work left to do. Howard? Howard, tonight with Reuters and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation disease. As these, that's new. You've taken out references to the war and Ukraine is causing price increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher. Yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come. So I'm wondering why is that the case and does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact? So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. This is what we thought what happens at the very beginning and now here it is actually happening. And for the reasons we thought, it's supply change, it's shortages, and it's demand revolving back toward services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's around a quarter of the PCE price index, core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services. And that's driven by very different things. And as I mentioned with housing services, we expect and other forecasters expect that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months. But we'll then come down assuming that that new lease is continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that's sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the good sector. And we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. And this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down, this is good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen. We hope soon in the core goods X housing. Sorry, the core core services X housing sector that I talked about. And I don't see it yet. It's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them that are the same. And we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60% of that will be is research which show is sensitive to slack in the economy. And so the labor market will probably be important. Some of the other ones that's, the labor market's not going to be important. But many other factors will drive it any case. We don't see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think we need to see that. It's the majority of the core PC index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PC, which is our mandate. So it's not that we're not, we're neither optimistic or pessimistic. We're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet until we do. I think we, you know, we see ourselves, we got to be honest with ourselves. We see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent, we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to, we have to complete the job. I mean, that's, that's what we're here for. Nick Timmeros, the Wall Street Journal, a chirpal you observed several years ago that we learned we can have low unemployment rate without above target inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level, despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? So, you know, we've raised rates four and a half percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think because inflation is still running very hot. We're, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that. It really, the story we're telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I've just gone through a couple times. And again, we don't see it affecting the services sector X housing yet. But I mean, I think our assessment is that we're not very far from that level. We don't know that, though. We don't know that. So I think we're at the end of the day.",0.0050848706674201,0.0077685178356319,95,2023-02-01,True,True,True,False,-0.0019025499110497,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:50:00,2023-02-01 20:00:00," we're living in a world of significant uncertainty. I would look across the rate, the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive, right by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is restrictive. We're trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That's all. And that's why we're slowing down to 25 basis points. We're going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting this week? You'll see the minutes will come out in three weeks and we'll give you a lot of detail. I, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn't want to start to drive and discard all the details there. But that was the sense of the discussion was really talking quite a bit about the path forward. Okay, Tori. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given that we've now hit up against it, I was wondering if the US goes past the X-Date. Will the Fed do whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent? Or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So your question is would we say your question again? Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So you're really asking about, but you're asking about prioritization and effect. Is that what you're, okay? So I feel like I have to say this. There's only one way forward here. And that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be highly risky. And that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I'm just gonna leave it at that. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that that would happen? I'm just gonna leave it at that. This is a matter that's to be resolved between, really, it's really Congress's job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don't involve us. We're not involved in those discussions. So we're the fiscal agent. Gina and this speaker. Gina Smiley from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases and then restarting them? Lori Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to suggest that that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that views broadly shared on the committee. So the committee, obviously, did not see this as a time to pause. We judged that the appropriate thing to do with this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25. Basis points and we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2%. So that's the judgment that we made. You know, we're going to write down new forecasts in March and we'll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will. Sorry, I should have been clear. I mean, would it be possible to take a meeting off for example and then resume? Could you rather than just doing it every meeting, a move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves? I mean, I think this is not something that the committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle though, you know, we used to think we used to do is go every other meeting if you remember 25 basis points. And that was considered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and they left it that they're willing to raise rates after pausing, but this is not something that, this is not something that the federal open market committee is on the point of deciding right now. Steve Lee's been CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1%. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1%. And you've achieved this without going to your 5.1% funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year. And you've also achieved it without the 1% is point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I'm wondering if you've considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong. And it's possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without without the surge in unemployment. And specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Leal Brandard who said to recent that inputs other than wages may have been responsible for important price increases for some non-housing services, an unwinding of these factors. In other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Thanks. So a couple things. First, on the forecast, you're right, if you take very short-term three-month say measures of PCE, core PCE inflation, they're quite low right now. But that's because that's driven by, significantly negative readings from goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory. And that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer run trend of something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4% by the middle of the year, for example. So that's really where the sustainable level is, is more like at 4%. So that would suggest there's work left to do. Let's say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible, as I mentioned. Obviously our policies data dependent, we would take that into account. In terms of the core non-housing services, as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60% of that subsector, of that sector, are we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way. But some of the other sectors are not. And for example, financial services is a big sector. That's really not driven by labor markets, wages. So that's why I said, there are a number of things that will affect, take restaurants. So clearly labor is important for restaurants, but so are food prices. And transportation services is gonna be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall though, my own view would be that you're not going to have a sustainable return to 2% inflation in that sector, without a better balance in the labor market. And I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften. And so far, we've got, as I mentioned in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here, but I still think, I continue to think that there's a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment. And that's because the setting we're in is quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints. Not something that you really have seen in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought. And we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think a story will emerge on the non-housing services sector soon enough. But I think there is ongoing disinflation and we don't yet see, we can't see in the labor market. So we'll have to see. Can we get there with a 5%? Certainly possible. Yeah, absolutely, it's possible. It's a question, no one really knows. I think it's because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways. It may well be that it will take more slowing than we expect than I expect to get inflation down to 2%. But I don't, that's not my base case. My base case is that the economy can return to 2% inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that's a possible outcome. Many, many forecasters would say it's not the most likely outcome, but I would say there's a chance of it. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio, I'd like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation.

So I'm wondering if you have changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward. And whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place which calls for more restraint on your part. So I do think you most forecast and my own assessment would be that growth will continue, positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of GDP growth of 1% last year and also final sales growth which we think is a better indicator of about 1%. I think most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors though that need to be considered. You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit and that will matter for us potentially. The global market remains very, very strong and that's job creation, that's wages as inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also state and local governments are really flush these days with money and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support, they're also spending a lot, there's a lot of spending coming in a construction pipeline both private and public and so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year and that's my base case is that there will be positive growth this year. Rich? Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg, first of all how are you doing? Fine, thanks. Good. Second of all, I think it's early on in the post conference you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you think? You mentioned three months, we've seen three months in a row of governor Walder suggested he might want to see six months. Is it just the inflation data or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that substantially more evidence? So I don't think there's a, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating accumulation of evidence. So of course we'll be looking by the time of the March meeting we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will and we'll be asking ourselves what are they telling us and soon after that we'll have another ECI wage report which as you know is a report that we we like because it is just for composition and it's very complete. And you know the one we got I guess it was yesterday was was constructive it's you know it shows wages coming down but still at a high level there's still at a level that's way above where well above where they were before the before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months but as the accumulated evidence comes in it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say though we you know it is our job to restore price stability and achieve two percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. Market participants have a very different job and it's a fine job it's a great job I'm Victor I did that job for for years but in one form or another but you know we have to deliver that and so we are strongly resolved that we will you know complete this task because we think it has benefits that will you know support economic activity and benefit the public for for many many years. Thank you so thank you for taking the questions so you've talked about we had solid job growth I'm ever Lawrence from Fox Business by the way we had solid job growth slight falling in the increase in consumer spending it seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to from a 9.1% CPI inflation to 6.5% CPI inflation is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2. I don't think we know honestly you know the so we of course expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021 and it didn't it didn't come down all through 22 and now it's coming down it's come down pretty fast. So I would say these are this is not a standard business cycle you can look at the last 10 times there was a global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did it it's just it's unique so I think certainty is just not appropriate here inflation it's just harder to forecast inflation it may come down faster it may take longer to come down and you know our job is to deliver inflation back to target and we will do that but I think we we're going to be cautious about about declaring victory and you know sending signals that that we think that the game is one because it you know it's we've got a long way to go it's just it's the early stages of disinflation and it's most welcome to be able to say that that we are now in disinflation but that's great but we we just see that it has to spread through the economy and it's going to take some time that's all. How long do you see them the federal fund rate remaining at this elevated level you know so are again the my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SCP and I mean there are many different forecasts but generally it's a forecast of slower growth some softening in labor market conditions and inflation moving down moving down steadily but not quickly and in that case if if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year. To loosen policy this year of course other people have forecast with with inflation coming down much faster that's a different thing you know if that happens inflation comes down much faster you know then we'll be seeing that and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy. Simon. Thank you chair Powell Simon to win a speech with the economist I may ask a further question about the language around ongoing increases that of course implies at least two further rate rises. If you look at Fed fund features pricing the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause are you concerned about that divergence or do you think of everything breaks right is that is out of plausible outcome. I'm not I'm not particularly concerned about about the divergence note because it's it is largely due to the markets expectation that inflation will move down more quickly I think that's that's the the bigger part of that. So again as I just mentioned we you know our forecast there different participants have different forecast but generally those forecast over for continued. Subdued growth some softening the labor market but not a recession not a recession and and we have inflation moving down. You know into the somewhere in the mid threes or maybe lower than that this year will update that in March but that's what we thought in December markets are past that they they show inflation coming down in some cases much quicker than that so we'll just have to see and we have a different view and a different view to different forecast really. And given our outlook I just I don't see us cutting rates this year if we get our have our outlook turns true as I mentioned just now if we do see inflation coming down much more quickly that'll that'll play into our policy saying of course. Stop. Hi, Jeff out Scott horse they're from PR one of the changes in the statement this this month is that the committee is no longer listening public health as a month of data points you'll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that as the federal reserve no longer see the pandemic as as weighing on the economy. That's the general sense of it look we understand I personally understand well that that that covid is still out there. But it that it's no longer playing an important role in our economy and you know we kept that statement in there for for quite a while and I think we just we knew we would take it out at some point there's never a perfect time but we thought that you know people are handling it better in the economy in the society or handling it better now it doesn't really need to be in it. You know in the feds monthly you know post meeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to you know a health issue. Nancy. Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Genser with marketplace wanted to go back to another thing that fed by share layup brainer to recently. She said she doesn't see signs of a wage price spiral and I'm wondering if you agree with that. I do yeah I do and I don't see that yet but the whole point is you know if you once you see it you're you have a serious problem that that that means that effectively in people's decision making inflation has become a really salient issue and once that happens that's which that's what we can't allow to happen and you know so that's why we worry that the longer we're at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long every day you know that the more",0.0061591475634194,0.0065504851758609,97,2023-02-01,True,True,True,False,-0.0019025499110497,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

 Inflation has slowed and the stock market has looked resilient for several months, with many economists crediting the Fed's recent actions as several key economic indicators show inflation easing after peaking last October..Previously, several central bank officials indicated the pace of interest rate hikes would slow as the economy begins to settle from the current conditions..Federal data published last week on personal income and spending showed some of the inflationary strains are starting to catch up with consumers, though it's unlikely the world's largest economy will experience a major recession..Financial experts said the latest economic data might lead the Fed to acknowledge that inflation was finally slowing and the economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but Powell was also known to be predictably measured in his words to head off volatility on Wall Street..Advertisement
 Some insiders said they believed the central bank would keep this latest hike in place for the remainder of the year, while other insiders said they would be listening for any indication of when the Fed could potentially scrap the ongoing rate increases down the road..Many economists believe the Fed rate hikes will slow the economy enough to cause a recession later this year..The gap between job openings and hiring suggests wage growth could remain elevated, though it cooled in the fourth quarter..Aggressive monetary policy tightening has left economists expecting a recession by the second half of the year..The third straight monthly contraction pushed the index to the lowest level since May 2020 and below the 48.7 mark viewed as consistent with a recession in the broader economy..""The muted increase in the ADP measure of private payroll employment will add to fears that the malaise in activity has spread to the labor market,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics in Toronto..COMMENTS:

 ""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back..ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..""Investors should be happy that we likely have a Fed that is going to end hikes fairly soon as the inflation data continues to show major improvements, which is exactly what the Fed needs to take their foot off the pedal."".How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".Following the gloom and doom of last year, investors have piled back into equities with the hopes that the Fed is at the end of or nearing the end of its policy tightening cycle..Traders keep buzzing about the gap between what Powell and company have been saying (We are going to keep raising rates, and we are going to keep them higher for longer.).The Fed's rate hikes are expected to slow the economy and perhaps cause a recession later this year..Stocks rallied to start 2023 as investors anticipated a less restrictive Fed..That would mark “the first ‘normal’ sized hike since March 2022,” when the central bank began its big anti-inflation push, the Deutsche Bank analysts Jim Reid and Henry Allen wrote to investors this morning..So will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has a way to go, or will the Fed show signs that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.US stocks are off to a very strong start in 2023 following last year’s abysmal showing..There’s a growing sense on Wall Street that the US economy may avoid a recession and instead wind up slowing to a so-called soft landing, a gradual slide in economic conditions that doesn’t lead to a massive spike in the unemployment rate or a major pullback in consumer spending..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..Policy-makers are adamant they will not make what they consider to be the crucial error of pausing further rate hikes until they are convinced inflation is on a durable path back to the 2 per cent goal..“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..Fed projections released in December indicate no cuts this year and continued rate hikes..watch now
 There won't be any ""dot plot"" this meeting of individual members' rate expectations, nor will there be an update to the Summary of Economic Projections on GDP, unemployment and inflation..""We see incredibly limited scope for the Fed to plausibly justify keeping this cycle going deeper into the year with what will already be a very restrictive policy stance in the face of what are likely mounting economic challenges to the backdrop."".Now that inflation pressures have eased in recent months, consumer spending and hiring have slowed, and wage increases have moderated, many analysts believe the central bank could even stop raising rates — and possibly cut them later this year..Others say it’s premature to assume a rate hike pause is on the horizon..Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..While they indicate the world’s top economy is slowing, hope is building that the data will allow the central bank to wind down its rate hikes..Concerns about rates being hiked too high and too quickly and therefore leading to a recession have spread among investors in recent months..** Meanwhile, Nomura chief China economist Ting Lu raised China's 2023 annual GDP growth forecast to 5.3% from 4.8%.",0.5826,"{

By the way, I think it's becoming less salient and people are, you know, we pick that up in conversations and I've seen some data too that show people are, you know, gradually, they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now and they're very, very low with 3.5 percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases, is nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. So that's what you're looking at most closely is consumer expectations. That's at the very hardest. Consumers in businesses that, you know, are essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are very, at a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That's a, that's a, sort of a bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be, we think it's important. And in this case, I would say the risk eight months ago or so, longer term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are, they seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it's, you know, and that's, I think that's very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided and the public has decided that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it's just a matter of us following through. That's measurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that'll be part of the process of getting it down and it's a very positive thing. Great. Thank you, Chair Powell, Greg Robb from Marker Watch. In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of senses that struck people as important. When the committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I haven't seen, heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members or is that still something you're concerned about? Thank you. I would put it this way. It's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place. As we've discussed a couple of times here, there's a different difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down. We're just going to have to see. I mean, I'm not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast. But our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we'll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we'll see. Good to bring in for the last question. Hi Chair Powell. Brendan Peterson with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer faster to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play an effect as we get closer to that drop-dead deadline this summer? I look at it's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two because I believe Congress will wind up acting and as it will and must in the end to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk the progress we're making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. We of course will monitor money market conditions carefully as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down and then it will grow back up and we understand there'll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that and we're watching it carefully. We'll just be monitoring it.

2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:40:00," Good afternoon. Before discussing today's meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode, and we will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision and Bars review of the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The reviews findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I'm confident that we will do so. From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Since early last year, we've raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We're also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we'll take a data dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy-forming may be appropriate. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest at 1.1 percent despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the year, job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March at 3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. All wage growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent. Following the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5 and a quarter percent, and we're continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more than a year. We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rates sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions. Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook. But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with monetary policy restraint we've put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold. In determining the extent to which additional policy affirming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will make that determination meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep our longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Installing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thanks, Deena. Hi, Gina Smyla. Can New York Times? Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes. If so, what a recession like what they're envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate. So taking your question, of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A decision on a pause was not made today. You will have noticed that in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is not in the statement anymore. We took that out and instead we're saying that in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% over time, the committee will take into account certain factors. That's a meaningful change that we were no longer saying that we anticipate. So we'll be driven by incoming data, meeting by meeting and we'll approach that question at the June meeting. So the staff's forecast is, so let me say start by saying that that's not my own most likely case which is really that the economy will continue to grow at a modest rate this year. I think that's so different people in the committee have different forecasts. That's my own assessment of the most likely path. Staff produces its own forecast and it's independent of the forecasts of the participants, which include the governors and the reserve bank presidents of course. And we think this is a healthy thing that the staff is writing down what they really think they're not especially influenced by what the governors think and vice versa. The governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it's actually good that the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So broadly the forecast was for a mild recession and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than has been typical in modern era recessions. I wouldn't want to characterize the staff's forecast for this meeting. We'll leave that to the minutes. But broadly similar to that.",0.0001696681775213,0.0058981233243968,104,2023-05-03,False,False,False,False,-0.0002394970125963,Negative,Positive,"Job gains have been

2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:40:00,2023-05-03 18:50:00," Thank you, Chair Powell, for the seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt limit stand off. You said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised. But do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default and what type of situation would that look like? So I wouldn't want to speculate specifically, but I will say this. These are fiscal policy matters for starters, and they're for Congress and the administration for the elected parts of the government to deal with, and they're really consigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this. It's essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they're due. A failure to do that would be unprecedented. We'd be in uncharted territory and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse. So I'll just leave it there. We don't give advice to either side. We just would point out that it's very important that this be done. The other point I'll make about that though is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential short and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. It would be so uncertain that it's just as important that this – we never get to a place where we're actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government's not paying its bills. And just to follow up, was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff? Did that affect today's monetary policy decision at all? I wouldn't say that it did. It was – of course, it's something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the outlook and that will – that come up – a number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn't say that it was important in today's monetary policy decision yet. Steve. Oh, thank you, Yemen. Steve Leigh's been CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you will inform that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks? Can you tell me what supervisory actions you've done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk? And kind of part three, but it's all the same question here. Do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy at supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you. Sure. So, the February 14 presentation, I didn't remember it very well, but now, of course, I've gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole board, the entire board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank which talked about the amount of losses they are marked to market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about that I recall anyway about the risk of a bank run. So it was, I think, the takeaway was they were going a way to do an assessment of vertical, sorry, a horizontal assessment of banks. It wasn't presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as an informational, non-decision kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation. And as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we're doing, of course, I think banks themselves, or many, many banks, are now attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since the events of early March to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. You know, like so many things, it's very useful. But ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They're both working well together. We've used our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And at the same time, we've been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I don't need to be argumentative, but the staff report said S.V.B. has significant interest rate risk. It said interest rate risk measurements failed at S.V.B. And it said banks with large unrealized losses faced significant safety and soundness risk. Why was that not alarming? Well, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't alarming. It was, they're pointing out something that they're working on and that they're on the case that, you know, that I'm not sure whether they mentioned, I think they did actually. They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter or supervise a reaction in the form of matters requiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say, yes, this is a bank and there are many other banks that are experiencing these things and we're on the case. Thank you. Got a big question. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, obviously, with the recent bank turmoil, we've seen multiple banks by other banks. And I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even larger. So we certainly don't and I don't have an agenda to further consolidate banks. There's been consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even. It goes back more than 30 years when I was in the government a while back. I think there were 14,000 banks. Now there are 4,000 in change. So that's going on. I personally have long felt that having small, medium and large size banks is a great part of our banking system. The community banks serve particular customers very well. Regional banks serve very important purposes and the various kinds of G-Sibs do as well. So I think it's healthy to have an arrange of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that's a positive thing. Is it a financial, so I would just say in terms of JP Morgan buying first republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely. That is their role. So I really don't have a comment on that process. As you know there's an exception to the deposit cap for failing bank. So it was legitimate and I think the FDAC I believe is bound by law to take the bid that is the least cost bid. So I would assume that's what they did. So do you have any concerns about the fact that they're getting larger in general? So I think it's probably good policy that we don't want the largest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. But this is an exception for a failing bank and I think it's actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also would have been a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks. But this company and that could have been the outcome. But ultimately we have to follow the law in our agencies and the law as it goes to the least cost bid. It's not a call. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. At the March meeting you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be equal to one or more rate increases. So given development since then how has your estimate changed? Yeah I think I follow that up by saying it's quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But in principle that's the idea. When we've been raising interest rates and that raises the price of credit in a sense restricts credit in the economy working through the price mechanism and when banks raise their credit standards that can also make credit tighten or in a kind of broadly similar way. It isn't possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other although firms are trying that and we're trying it but ultimately we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment. So it does complicate the task of achieving sufficiently restrictive stance but I think conceptually though we think that interest rates in principle we won't have to raise rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don't know how persistent these effects will be. We don't know how large they'll be and how long they'll take to be transmitted but that's what we'll be watching carefully to find out. Just to quickly follow up what does it suggest about the scope for the committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month even if the data remains strong then if it's having some kind of substitute effect. This is just something that we have to factor in as we want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say this way. The assessment of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one. Meeting by meeting and we're going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that are listed in the statement, the obvious factors. That's the way we're going to be thinking about it. And that's really all we can do. As I said it does complicate. We have a broad understanding of monetary policy.

2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:50:00,2023-05-03 19:00:00," There's a lot of literature on that, but translating it into rate Ix is uncertain, let's say it adds even further uncertainty. Nonetheless, we'll be able to see what's happening with credit conditions, what's happening with lending. We get a lot of data on that and we'll factor that into our decision making. Howard Shire with Reuters, thank you. So noting that the statement dropped the reference to sufficiently restricted, restrictive, I was wondering given your baseline outlook whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5 and a quarter percent is in fact sufficiently restrictive. So that's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to need a data to accumulate on that. Not an assessment that we've made. That would mean we think we've reached that point and I just think it's not possible to say that with confidence now. But nonetheless, you will know that the summary of economic projections from the March meeting showed that at that point in time that the median participant thought that this was the appropriate level of the ultimate high level of rates. We don't know that. We'll revisit that at the June meeting. And that's, you know, we're just going to have to, before we really declare that, I think we're going to have to see data accumulating and make that, as I mentioned, it's an ongoing assessment. I follow up on credit. Could you give us a sense of what the SLU's survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were tightening credit as of the last survey. What did this one show and how did that weigh and do two-year deliberations? So we're going to release the results of the SLU's on May 8th in line with our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLU's is broadly consistent when you see it with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we're seeing from other sources. You will have seen the beige book and listen to the various earnings calls that indicate that mid-size banks have, some of them have been tightening their lending standards. Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year. Let's go to Nick. Nick Temerowski, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as you've discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year. So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today or put differently. If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you've, for the last two meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the committee feel it was necessary to keep moving? Well, the reason is that we, again, with our monetary policy, we're trying to reach and then stay at an extended period, a level of policy stance that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation at 2% over time. And that's what we're trying to do with our tool. I think slowing down was the right move. I think it's enabled us to see more data and it will continue to do so. So we really, we have to balance. We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard's question, you'll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six week intermeeting cycle? I, yeah, I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one. So you know, you can't with economic data. You can't, you've seen take inflation from it. Look, look back. We've seen inflation come down, move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We've seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you're going to want to see that, you know, that a few months of data will persuade you that you've got this right kind of thing. And you know, we have the luxury. We've raised 500 basis points. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably that you can calculate them many different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a reasonable estimate of, let's say one year inflation, which might be 3%. So you've got 2% real rates that's meaningfully above what most people would, many people, anyway, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight and you see that in interest, interest sensitive activities and you also begin to see it more and more in other activities. And if you put the, you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that's ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we're, we're, we may not be far off or possibly even at that level. Thank you. Edward. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3% inflation as the projections show at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3% inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2% target? I, I think we're always going to have 2% as our target. We're always going to be focusing on getting there. I'll be okay with, will they pull on 3%? You know, it's, let me just say that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for inflation going down to 2% over time. I mean, we, that's, that's not a question that's in front of us and it would depend on so many other things. But ultimately, we're not looking to get to 3% and then drop our tools. We have a goal of getting to 2%. We think it's going to take some time. We don't think it'll be a smooth process and, you know, I think we're going to, we're going to need to stay at this for a while. How does the other side of the mandate, the jobs side, want you to get to 3% going from 3 to 2? How does the other side of the mandate with balance? I think they, they, you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point. Right now you have a labor market that's still extraordinarily tight. You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening and labor market conditions, but overall, you're near a 50 year low and unemployment wages. You all will have seen the wage number from late last week and it's, you know, whenever it was and, you know, it's, it's a couple of percentage points above what would be, what would be consistent with 2% inflation over time. So we do see some softening. We see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But labor market is very, very strong. Labor's inflation is, you know, running high well above our, well above our goal and right now we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we've been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Bosa with Bloomberg News. So many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of the federal of officially, many federal earnings report agreed to state unemployment critical problems. So it's reports discussed on the July 2020 policy proposed in the last step of the fall that the fiscal year after theice policy adopted a reduction period early, middle of art, maybe every year when you crack up supposed a ordinance. So I'm simply querying and Hee musically saying, what do you think would be there in your life recommendation? Of course, most private sector forecasters. Yeah, I don't think, you know, I know what's printed in the summary of economic projections and all that. I don't think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don't know what they were thinking for first quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I'll just say, I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different. And the reason is there's just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It's interesting is, you know, we raise rates by five percentage points in 14 months. And the unemployment rate is three and a half percent, pretty much where it was even lower than it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see by surveys and much, much evidence that conditions are cooling gradually, but it really is different. You know, it wasn't supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much as they've declined without unemployment going up. Well, that's what we've seen. So there are no promises in this, but it just seems to me that it's possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I fully appreciate that. That would be against the pattern. But I do think that this, that the situation in the labor market with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually, wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down. And that's a good sign, down to more sustainable levels. So I think that, I think it's still possible. I, you know, I think, you know, the, the case,",0.0007587345521645,0.0060668079818726,106,2023-05-03,False,False,False,False,-0.0002394970125963,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 3, 2023

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..ING expects rate cuts to begin as soon as November this year.Analysts at Nomura also note that a 25 bps hike is likely on Wednesday, but going forward, the monetary policy tightening could come to an end.“There appears to have been uptake in emergency borrowings at the San Francisco Fed region, even after adjusting for the impact of quantitative tightening, which might be related to continued news of stress at the First Republic Bank,” the brokerage said, adding that it expects rate cuts to start in March 2024.All in all, the consensus is that the FOMC is highly likely to deliver one last 25 bps rate hike today while keeping a close watch on inflation..Rate cuts could begin later this year, but until then, economists expect gradual easing up of monetary policies..Some evidence has already emerged that banks have toughened their lending standards since March, but the full extent remains to be seen..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”
 Tighter credit conditions help the Fed curb demand to bring down inflation..That will be a balancing act between suggesting a pause is in the cards but still is dependent on incoming data should inflation turn higher going forward."".Multiple factors will come into play as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues point to where monetary policy is heading..Recent indicators point to a softening but only to a level that is still well above the Fed's 2% target..""The focus will be on revisions to the forward guidance in its statement,"" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note..""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit."".In the portion of the statement where the Fed provides guidance, Mericle expects to see a sentence that could look something like, ""The Committee anticipates that the stance of monetary policy will most likely be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time but will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy."".""The center of the committee acknowledges the unknown macroeconomic effect of credit tightening, keeping the potential need for further rate hikes on the table,"" Hollenhurt added.",0.5866,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 3, 2023

But it's not that the case of having a recession is, I don't rule that out either. It's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mile recession. The committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation. Do you see that as well? And could you kind of explain how you come to that judgment? Sure. So we look at a range of wage measures and then that's phenomenal. So you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation. And so you can look at the employment compensation index average hourly earnings, see Atlanta wage tracker compensation per hour, basically those four and many others. You can look at what they would have to run at over a long period of time to be consistent with 2% inflation. They can deviate. Corporate margins can go up and down and there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down where labor gets a bigger share in our session. Sorry, later in expansion. And we calculate those and you have to take the precision with a degree of salt. But I would say that what they will show is that if wages are running at 5%, 3% is closer to where they need to be. A wage increase isn't closer to 3% roughly is what it would take to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. By the way, I don't want to. I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You're asking me a very specific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together and it's very hard to say what's causing what. But I've never said that wages are really the principal driver because I don't think that's really right. Great. Chris Regabre, I'd associated press. Well, you mentioned profit margins. Those have expanded, did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven't fallen as much as might be expected, given that we're seeing at least some pull back among consumer spending. So speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months? So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand. Too much demand, not enough supply. And we've been in a situation in many parts of the economy where supply has been fixed or not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices. So to get, I think as goods pipelines have gotten back to normal so that we don't have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing, I think you will see inflation come down. And you'll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition where there's enough supply to meet demand. And then it's, then you're really back to full competition. That's, that would be the dynamic I would expect. Michael McKee from Blueburg Radio and television. Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is? Your policy framework is going forward when you look at the economy at the next meeting. Are you looking at incoming data, which is by definition backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in? I didn't catch the last part of ruling. Mark Barrett has priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay. So what are we looking at? I mean, we look at a combination of data and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we're always looking at both. You know, and it will, of course, it'll be the obvious things. It'll be readings on inflation. It'll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things. I think a particular focus for us going now over the past six, seven weeks now, and going forward is going to be what's happening with credit tightening. Our small and medium-sized banks tighten credit standards. And is that having an effect on loans, on lending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy. That'll be an important thing. I just, you know, we'll be looking at everything. It's, again, I would just point out we've raised rates by five percentage points. We are shrinking the balance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening, not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more due to what's happened. And we have to factor all of that in and make our assessment of, you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable legs. So this is challenging, but, you know, we will make our best assessment, and that's what we're thinking. What about the idea of rate cuts? Yeah, so we, on the committee, have a view that inflation is going to come down. Not so quickly, but it will take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates, and we won't cut rates. If you have a different forecast, and, you know, markets have been, from time to time, pricing, and, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we'd factor that in, but that's not our forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down, particularly now, if you look at non-housing services, it really hasn't moved much, and it's quite stable, and, you know, so we think we'll have to demand, we'll have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And again, in that world, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to cut rates. Courtney? Courtney Brown from Axios. I'm curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you think it's contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits? And did the committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine, and, you know, it's really not contributing. We don't think now it hasn't actually been growing. You know, it moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now, what happened was institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the federal home loan banks and things like that. Over the course of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual, as they do in every tightening cycle, they've been gradually moving their deposits into higher yielding places, such as CDs and other things, including money market funds. So that's a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a tightening cycle. What was unusual really was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around things like that, but it doesn't seem to have had any effect overall on the overnight reprope facility. That is really there to help us keep rates where they're supposed to be, and it's serving that purpose very well. Okay, Sarah. Sarah, you all waste CBS news. I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets, and borrowing? I would just say it's, I don't really think we should be, we shouldn't even be talking about a world in which the US doesn't pay its bills. It just shouldn't be a thing. Again, I would just say we don't, no one should assume that the Fed can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from the damage that such an event might inflict. Scott. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley from NPR. This is a report last week by Chair Bard identified a couple of factors that he thought contributed to the or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank. A policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny. And also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019, do you share that view and what would it take to get the stronger oversight that you and he said it and your release would be necessary? So I didn't take part in creating the report or doing the work but I do, I have read it of course and I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this way.

I think the only thing that I'm really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is, it may just have been technology evolving, we have to keep up with all that, but some of it may be our policies and supervisor and regulatory, whatever. Well, what our job is now is identify those things and implement them. And that's kind of the only thing I care about is, and I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. Can I add that? Thank you, Evan Reiser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking terminal among regional banks? And secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying? So, I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks really from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved and all the deposits have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of first republic kind of draws a line under that period of, is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of severe stress, okay? I also think we are very focused on what's happening with credit availability, particularly with what you saw in the beige book and you will see in the sleuths is medium size, small and small, small, medium size banks are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards, build liquidity. What's going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we will continue to very carefully monitor what's going on in the banking system and will factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way going forward. Great. Thank you, Frit Chairman. Great grab from MarketWatch. I just wondered if you've done any reflection on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last, since you've been Frit Chairman. I think I've heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the vice chair for supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go about this and comments on that, thank you. Sure, so let me say first of all, I've been chair of the board for five plus years now and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we've learned some new things as well and we need to do better. And as I mentioned, I thought the report was on flinching inappropriately. So I welcome it and I agree with and we'll support those recommendations and I do feel that I'm personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So on the vice chair for supervision, the place to start is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The vice chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations develop policy recommendations for the board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution companies and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms. So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the board, not the chair, as vice chair for supervision, who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the board of governors. Congress wanted that person to be, to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it works, the way it has worked in practice for me is I've had a good working relationship. I give my council my input privately and I offer that and I have good conversations and I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with vice chair bar and as predecessor. And I think that's the way it's supposed to work and that's appropriate. I believe that's what the law requires. And, you know, but it isn't, I wouldn't say it's a matter of complete deference. It's more, I have a role in presenting my views and discussing having an intelligent discussion about what's going on and why and you know, that's my input but ultimately that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the board of governors and really in supervision has sole authority over supervision. I just wondered if you had any regrets. Was there anything that, you know, decisions that maybe we regret now in light of what's happened? I've had a few. Sure, I mean, you know, who doesn't look back and think that you could have done things differently but honestly, you don't get to do that. Again, my focus is on what you control the controlable as one of my great mentors used to always say, control the controlable. What we control now is make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are and implement them. And I think that Vice Chair of ours report is an excellent first step in that but we've got to fall through. Great. Thank you. Hey there, Megan Casalo with Barons. Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all and how seriously was that considered? I'm curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board. I would say there are a number of people and you'll see this in the minutes. I don't want to try to do the head count in real time but people did talk about pausing but not so much at this meeting. You know, there's a sense that we're much closer to the end of this than to the beginning that, you know, as I mentioned, if you add up all the tightening that's going on through various channels, it's, we feel like we, you know, we're getting close or maybe even there but that again, that's going to be an ongoing assessment and we're going to be looking at those factors that we listed in to determine whether there's more to do. I'm here to you how to interpret that and the changes to the statement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting or would a strong jobs reporter inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again? I don't want to, I couldn't really say. I just think we're, I think we look, I think we've moved a long way fairly quickly and I think we can afford to look at the data and make a careful assessment. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, again, so with Marketplace, you mentioned a few times about the lessons you learned from the banking crisis that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons? Well, I just would start with something that's changed really, which is the run on Silicon Valley bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history and that now needs to be reflected in some way, in regulation and in supervision. We know now that we know it's possible. I think we didn't know and thought that was possible. No one had, I'm not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so quite so quickly. So I think that, that will play through, I'm, it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think that's one thing. I guess I would just say that. Then, you know, that we're going to, obviously, we're going to revisit. It's pretty clear we need to me, anyways, clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I'm thinking that we're on the track to do that as well. Any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations and certain parts of the economy? Yeah, that's, see, that's what Vice Chair Barr's role really is and he'll take the lead on that. Thank you. Thank you.

2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:40:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points, and we have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged, and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2% over time. And I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, and recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Although growth and consumer spending has picked up this year, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. Committee participants generally expect a subdued growth to continue. In our summary of economic projections, the median projection has real GDP growth at 1.0% this year and 1.1% next year, well below the median estimate of the longer run normal growth rate. The labor market remains very tight. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged a robust 283,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate moved up but remained low in May at 3.7%. There are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. While the jobs to workers gap has declined, labor demand still substantially exceed as the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.1% at the end of this year and 4.5% at the end of next year. Inflation remains well above our longer run 2% goal. Over the 12 months ending in April, total PCE prices rose 4.4%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.7%. In May, the 12 months changing the consumer price index came in at 4%, and the change in the core CPI was 5.3%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2% this year, 2.5% next year, and 2.1% in 2025. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9% this year. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 percentage points. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of how far we've come, in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and potential headwinds from credit tightening. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. As I noted earlier, nearly all committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we've moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves, as projected, the median participant projects at the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6% at the end of this year, 4.6% at the end of 2024 and 3.4% at the end of 2025. For the end of this year, the median projection is a half percentage point higher than in our March projections. By hastened to add, as always, that these projections are not a committee decision or plan, as the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. For storing price stability, it is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. And we do, at the Fed, in service to our public mission. We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. I'm curious what gives you and the committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated, interest rate sensitive sectors like housing, while they felt the drag of the past Fed actions have started to recover in some regions and financial conditions, you know, most recently we're easing. So I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence. And that of the speed of tightening the level to which rates would need to go, and then in the period of time over which we need to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up, and we moved very quickly by historical standards.

2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:40:00,2023-06-14 18:50:00," consecutive 75 basis point hikes we moderated to a pace of 50 basis point hikes and then this year to 325 basis point hikes at sequential meetings. So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rate steady at this meeting, I would just say it's a continuation of that process. The main issue that we're focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time. So the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables. Given how far we have come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace. I want to stress one more thing and that is that the committee decision made today was only about this meeting. We didn't make any decision about going forward including what would happen at the next meeting including we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every other meeting kind of an approach or really any other approach. We really were focused on what to do at this meeting. So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move. So again we didn't we didn't make a decision about July. I mean of course it came up in the meeting from time to time but really the focus was on what to do today. I would say about July two things. One decision hasn't been made to. I do expect that it will be a live meeting. Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wish this morning if you could help us understand the narrative here because it feels like there's been a level shift in the dots. Stronger GDP less of a hit on employment, slower progress on inflation and I'm wondering in this sort of where's the disinflation coming from? The labor market is going to be stronger. It looks like it's not coming from there. Demand is not coming down all that fast according to GDP. You've doubled your estimate of GDP. So what's the narrative here? It seems like it's getting more immaculate rather than more messy. So you're right that the data came in I would say consistent with but on the high side of expectations. So and if you go back to the former SEP, the last SEP in March you will see that growth moved up. These are not huge moves but growth estimates moved up a bit unemployment estimates moved down a bit. Inflation estimates moved up to bit and you know the all three of those kind of point in the same direction which is you know that perhaps more restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So although the level frankly is pretty the level of 5.6 is pretty consistent if you think about it where the federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March. So but so we've kind of gone back to that. So your question is where is the disinflation going to come from? And you know I don't think the story has really changed. We the committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one. It's going to take some time. And I think you go back to the to the three-part framework for core PC inflation which is we think as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward. You start with goods with goods we need to see continued healing and supply conditions, supply side conditions. They've definitely improved a substantial amount but if you talk to people in business they will say it's not back to where it was. So that's that's one thing and that should enable goods prices to continue because inflation to continue to come down over time. In terms of housing services inflation that's another big piece and you are seeing there that new rents new leases are coming in at low levels and it's really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline. In fact I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose of this year and next year will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source and that's again probably going to come slower than we would affect. That leaves you know the big sector which is a little more than half part of the core PC inflation that's not housing services and you know we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there. It's a sector it's a very broad and diverse sector I would say in a number of the parts of that sector the largest cost would be wage costs. It's a service sector so it's heavily labor intensive and I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions which we have seen. We have actually seen you know go through a number of indicators suggesting there's been some loosening in labor market conditions we need to see that continue. I would almost say that the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are coming into place and that would be growth meaningfully below trend. It would be a labor market that's loosening it would be good pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing. The things are in place that we need to see but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell what's the value in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now I mean not to be flippant but I don't lose weight just by buying a gym membership I have to actually go to the gym. Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year end 23 rate today. A majority of you think you're going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year so why not just rip off the bandaid and raise rates today. So the first I would say that the question of speed is a separate question from that of level. Okay so and I think if you look at the SEP that is our estimate our individual is really accumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go I mentioned how we got to those numbers. In terms of speed it's what I said at the beginning which is speed was very important last year as we get closer and closer to the destination and according to the SEP we're not so far away from the destination in most people's accounting. It's reasonable it's common sense to go a little slower just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting and so the committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace if only slightly and there are benefits to that so that gives us more information to make decisions we may try to make better decisions I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we as we make our decisions going forward and we'll get to see you know we haven't really we don't know the full extent of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we've seen we it would be early to see those but we don't know what the extent is we'll have some more time to see that unfolding it's it's just the idea that we're trying to get this right and this is if you think of the two things as separate variables then I think I think that the skip I shouldn't call it skip the decision makes sense I know you said July is live with only one June employment with only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting you get the ECI after you get the senior loan officer survey after you get some bank earnings at the end of next month what incremental information will the committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is in fact a skip or longer pause well I think you're adding that to the data that we've seen since the last meeting too you know we since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting is it'll really be a three-month period of data that we can look at I think that's a full quarter and I think you can you can draw more conclusions from that than you come from any six any six week period we'll look at those things we'll also look at the evolving risk picture we'll look at what's happening in the financial sector we'll look at all the data the evolving outlook and we'll make a decision thanks for taking our questions Gina Smiley New York Times you obviously in your forecast marked up the sort of path for growth marked down the path for unemployment marked up the path for inflation pretty notably I wonder you know since March what has changed to make you think that the economy is a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn and given that you know why do you feel confident this is as high as you're going to have to revise the federal funds rate or do you think it's possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this this cycle you know I mean on the first part I just think we're following the data and also the outlook the economy is the labor market I think has surprised many if not all analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience really and it's just remarkable and that's really if you think about it that's what's driving it's its job creation it's it's wages moving up it's it's supporting spending which in turn is supporting hiring and it's it's really the engine it seems that is that is driving the economy so it's really the data in terms of you know we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year that's that's how we do it it's based on our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is it can be it can actually in reality wind up being lower or higher and I you know there's really no way to know but it's it is it's it's what people think as of today and as the as a data come in it can move around",0.003860205418074,0.0040906374959783,110,2023-06-14,True,True,False,False,-0.0041848658784789,Negative,Positive,"For release at 200 p.m. EDT June 14, 2023

2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 18:50:00,2023-06-14 19:00:00," during the intermitting period, it could wind up back in the same place, but it really will be data driven. I can't tell you that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance. Mr. Chairman, thanks for the question. You had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into ballots. Is that still the case or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there? And also, could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate? Is the, obviously the current rate, according to the committee, is not sufficiently restrictive? Is it five, six? Is it six, where is this sufficiently restrictive? Thank you. You know, I would say again that I think that over time, the balance of risks as we move from, very, you know, from interest rates that are effectively zero now to five percentage points with an SEP calling for additional hikes. I think we've moved much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate. And I think that means, almost by definition, that the risks of sort of overdoing it and underdoing it are getting closer to being in balance. I still think, and my colleagues agree, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still. So we don't think we're there with inflation yet because we're just looking at the data. Now, if you look at the full range of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just aren't seeing a lot of progress over the last year. Headline, of course, inflation has come down materially, but as you know, we look at core as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going. This officially, so I think, you know, what we'd like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down. That's what we want to see. Of course, that's what we want to see. And I think it's also, we understand that there are lags, but remember that it's more than a year since financial conditions began tightening. I think the reason we're comfortable pausing is that we are still much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year. And I think it's reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect. So we're, you know, I think stretching out into a more moderate pace is appropriate to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you know, more with more data over time. Rachel? Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask further on the lag effects. When you're considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come into effect that would inform your decisions? Have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect? Yeah. So it's a challenging thing in economics. It's sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable lags. Of course, these days financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes. So if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off. By the time we had lifted off the two year, which is a pretty good estimate of where policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points. So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where news was in newspapers and not on the wire. So that's different. But it's still the case that what you see is interest sensitive spending is affected very, very quickly. So housing and durable goods and things like that. But broader demand and spending and asset values and things like that, they just take longer. And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that. So there's not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes. So then that makes it challenging, of course. So we're looking at the calendar. We're looking at what's happening in the economy. We're having to make these judgments. And again, it's one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate pace now as we seek that ultimate. I can't point to a specific data point. I think we'll see it when we see inflation really, really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften. I think we'll know that it's working. And ideally, by taking a little more time, we won't go well past the level where we need to go. I was curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on credit tightening since the bank incidents from March and how you're teasing that out apart from these lagifests. So it's too early still to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean. And that's something we're going to be watching, of course. And if we were to see what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of this channel, then we would factor that into account on making rate decisions. So that's how we think about it. It's good, Chris. Thanks, Chris Regaber, and I've associated press. You mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see core services ex housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months. And as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices. And then we've had some quirks in used car prices. So given that these trends are in place, I guess I'm sort of asking the flip side of Nick's question, why signal additional rate hikes aren't things headed in the direction you need? Why not simply give it even more time or it's surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots, given what we're seeing recently? Yeah, so we remember we've were two and a half years into this, or two and a quarter years into this. And forecasters, including Fed forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and typically forecasted that it would and been wrong. So I think if you look at the core PCE inflation overall, look at it over the last six months, you're just not seeing a lot of progress. It's running, and it's running at a level over 4.5%. It's far above our target and not really moving down. We want to see it moving down decisively. That's all. Of course, we are going to get inflation down to 2% over time. We don't want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course. But we have to get inflation down to 2% and we will. And we just don't see that yet. So the hence you see today's policy decision, both to write down for the rate hikes by the end of this year, but also to moderate somewhat the pace with which we're moving. Quick follow up. I mean, the last press conference you mentioned, you didn't see wages driving inflation. And there was some research from the San Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren't necessarily key driver. But you've talked about the labor market today and the need for softening. Can you give us a little more specifically how you see the tightly-remarket driving inflation at this point? Thank you. Right. So I'm not going to comment on any particular paper. But I would say that the overall picture is that at the beginning in early 2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for largely for goods. People were still at home. They had money in the bank and they wanted to spend. They spent a lot on goods. And of course, at the same time, and because of that high demand to some extent, supply chains got all snorled up. So prices went way up, inflation went way up. So that was the origin. And it wasn't really particularly about the labor market or wages. But as you moved into through 21 to 22 and now in 23, I think many, many analysts believe that it will be important, an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the non-housing services sector. And getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that it's consistent with 2% inflation. We actually have seen wages broadly moved down, but just at a quite gradual pace. So that's a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a few weeks ago, which is very consistent with what I would think. It's going to Michael McKee. Michael McKee from Blueburg Radio and television. You said in the past that you don't like to surprise markets. It's kind of been the Fed's view. Markets should have an idea of what you're going to do before you go in. You also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down. You reiterated that again today. And that we get to a point where inflation could be sticky. So I'm wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function. What will you be reacting to time or data? In other words, if nothing much changes, if we're looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September or November, will you move? Because you've said you feel you need to. Is it time that's going to require additional movement or would it be your reversal in inflation? So I don't want to deal with hypotheticals about different ways data might move out. So we, of course, we don't go out of our way to surprise markets or the public. At the same time, our main focus has to be.",-0.0012115418993672,0.0025460467463356,111,2023-06-14,True,False,False,False,-0.0041848658784789,Negative,Negative,"For release at 200 p.m. EDT June 14, 2023

2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 19:00:00,2023-06-14 19:10:00," you know, getting the policy right. And that's what we're doing here. And that's what we'll do for the upcoming meetings. I will say that July meeting will be live. And we'll just have to see. I think you'll see the data. You'll hear fed people talking about it and markets will have to make a judgment. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to know what's happening? I think if you look at, if you just look at, I'll just point you to the forecast. So inflation is running. Core PCU's inflation is running at about 4.5, a little higher than 4.5%. And the median F1C participant thinks it'll go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis. This is by the end of this year. So that's expecting pretty substantial progress. That's a pretty significant decline for half a year. So that's the forecast. We do try to be transparent in our reaction function. We're committed to getting inflation down. And that's the number one thing. So that's how I think about it. It's going to be Victoria. Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you're thinking about it? What are you looking for to judge whether we're approaching reserve scarcity and is treasury issuance going to affect that? Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks? So let me say, first of all, on the treasury part of it, if I can talk about that, and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that, of course, we've been very focused on that for a couple of months. As everyone has, treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly. I think we all saw. I saw the Secretary's comments yesterday to the effect that treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid market disruption and that they're going to watch carefully for that. So that's from the treasury, which actually sets the borrowings. At the Fed, we'll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the treasury refills the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both the reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves. It's really hard to say at the beginning of this, which will be greater. We are starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated RRP to take up for that matter. So we don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term, or even over the course of the year. So that's the treasury part of the answer. We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we're prepared to make adjustments to make sure that monetary policy transmission works. Was there another part of your question? Yeah. Are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks? So we have a number of, I would say, the RRP doesn't look like it's pulling money out of the banking system. It's actually been shrinking here lately. So I don't think that's not something we've thought about a lot over time. It doesn't really look like that's something we would do. I think it's a tool that we have. If we want to use it, we can. There are other tools we can use to address money market issues. But I wouldn't say that that's something that's likely that we would do in the near term. I'll go. Janelle Marte with Bloomberg. Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecast? And how does it factor into monetary policy? So certainly housing, very interest-sensitive. And it's the first place, really, or one of the first places that's either helped by low rates or that is held back by higher rates. And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year. We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit. We're watching that situation carefully. I do think we will see rents and house prices filtering into housing services inflation. And I don't see them coming up quickly. I do see them kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now. And that's appropriate. Do you think you'll have to target with further rate increases? Well, I think we look at everything. We don't just look at housing. So I think the way it works is individual participants sit in their offices all over the country and they write down their forecast. And including their most likely forecast, including their rate forecast. And then they send it in on Friday afternoon. And we accumulate it. And then we publish it for you. So that's how they do that. I don't know that housing is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it's part of it. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about in the past, about unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in 10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033. At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because I'm assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep the inflation in check with the higher level spending. I don't do that. That's really not my job. We hope and expect that other policy makers will respect our independence on monetary policy. And we don't see ourselves as the judges of appropriate fiscal policy. I will say, and many of my predecessors have said that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path and that needs to be addressed over time. But I think trying to get into that with lawmakers would be inappropriate given our independence and our need to stick to our netting. Is there any conversation then about the federal reserve financing some of that debt that we're seeing come to the pike? No. Under no circumstances. Courtney. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. So looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly or forecast for GDP this year. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward. And so should we take that as a sign that the committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing, at least as it relates to what you were expecting in March? You know, I would just say it this way. I continue to think in this really hasn't changed that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment that we've seen in so many past instances. It's possible in a way a strong labor market is that gradually cools could aid that along. It could aid that along. But I guess I want to come back to the main thing, which is though, simply this, we see the committee, as you can see from the SEP, the committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2%, and we'll do whatever it takes to get it down to 2%, over time, that is our plan. And we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the US economy is the thing that we cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today's workers and families and businesses, but also for the future. Getting price stability back and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it's sustained. And it really is the bedrock of the economy. And you should understand that that is our top priority. Just a quick follow up on that. I'm just a little confused because you said the committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time. But when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the Fed funds rate is lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that? Sure. So if you look two and three years out with the forecast, first of all, I wouldn't put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they're so highly uncertain. But what they're showing is that as inflation comes down in the forecast, if you don't lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up. So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point two years out, let's say, should come down just to maintain real rates. And actually, since we're probably going to, we're having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly so for us to get inflation down, that probably means that that certainly means that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly. And again, we're talking about a couple years out. I think as anyone can see, not a single person on the committee wrote down a rate cut this year. Nor do I think it is all likely to be appropriate, if you think about it. Inflation has not really moved down. It is not so far reacted much to our existing rate hikes. And so we're going to have to keep that.

2023-06-14 18:30:00,2023-06-14 19:10:00,2023-06-14 19:19:01," Thank you. H. Apple, Julie Schumann, AFP news agency. The major report showed a rebound in May in Black workers on employment. Is it consistent with the Fed's maximum employment mandate? Are you worried about that about this rebound? So we are, of course, worried about. There are longstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across our labor market. That's a factor that we can't really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment, it is for us a broad and inclusive goal. And so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows, historic modern lows here. So we're still talking about, I mean, is a strong labor market, as we've seen in half century here in the United States. So overall, unemployment of 3.7% is 310 higher than it was a measure to be at the last month ago. But still, it's extraordinarily low. And so it's a very, very tight labor market. Meghan. Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the right question on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how we all back up. We haven't quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet. And we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there's not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how that played into today's outcome? I wouldn't say that's, you know, as a factual matter that's correct. We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want the inflation to come down into rental is a very large part of the CPI about a third and it's about half of that for the PCE. So it's important. And so we're something that we're watching very carefully. It's part of the overall picture. I wouldn't say it's the decisive part, but take a step back. What you see is look at core inflation over the past six months year, you're just not seeing a lot of progress, not the kind of progress we want to see. And that's, it's hard to avoid that. And, you know, the committee, people in the committee, the median went up significantly so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on 12 month basis will be 3.9% this year. So once again, every year, for the past three years, it's going up over the course of the year and that's doing that again. So we see that and we see that inflation forecast are coming in low again. And do we see that that tells us that we need to do more? And so we're, that's why you see the SEP with where it is. Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and given the recent slowdown in core services, excluding housing? How far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line? So wages will continue to increase. So we, you know, what we're talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so I think we've seen some progress. All of the major measures of wages have moved down from extremely elevated, not extremely, highly elevated levels a year or so ago and they're moving back down but quite gradually. And, you know, we want to see that process continue. Gradually, of course, it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2% which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst and the fastest by high inflation. Thank you so much, Chair Pograeg Robb from Marker Watch. I just wondered if the committee has talked at all about the labor market and there's strikes now and Hollywood and now the United Auto Workers are talking about a possible strike. I mean, aren't workers, we have some workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages. Does that come up in your discussions? Thanks. So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market is about as central a topic toward discussions as anything. I mean, it's very labor economics and a labor market are utterly central. It's half of our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think, you know, we, there are structural issues that are really not for the Fed and so we don't spend a lot of time, although we take notice of what's going on. But we're not, you know, we're not involved in discussions or debates over strikes and things like that. But we, you know, we look and we see what's going on and, you know, we're making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to 2% in the aggregate. As I said, don't think that was about, I didn't, most folks would say now it wasn't really about that about wages at the beginning. And it's becoming more about that as we, as we get into really service sector inflation, which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress. It's going to mark for the last question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mark Kamrick with Bank Rate. I'm wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk. Now that we're about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and also specifically, what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as non-bank financials and could you further elevate those risks with higher still rates possibly for longer? So we're trying to think where to start. I'll start with commercial real estate. We, of course, were watching that situation very carefully. There's a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system. A large part of it is in smaller banks. It's well distributed. To the extent it's well distributed, then the system could take losses. We do expect that there'll be losses. But there'll be banks that have concentrations. And those banks will experience larger losses. So we're well aware of that. We're monitoring it carefully. It feels like something that will be around for some time, as opposed to something that will suddenly hit and work its way in the systemic risk. In terms of non-bank financial sector, there's been a ton of work. And clearly in the pandemic, it really was the non-bank financial sector where issues really arose. And there's a lot of work going on with the administration, in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the treasury market and in all kinds of areas in non-bank financial market. But our jurisdiction at the Fed is over banks. It's actually bank holding companies and some banks. So that's really our main focus. In terms of the events of March, as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully monitoring that situation. Our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things that may go wrong. And that would include the banks who might be hard for me to identify something that we don't worry about rather than that we do worry about. So we're watching those things very carefully. And as we see things unfold, as we see what's happening with credit conditions and also all the individual banks that are out there, we'll be able to take to the extent it's appropriate. We can take, if they're macroeconomic implications, we can take that into account in our rate setting. And so I guess that's what I would say. That's all of the last part. Do you risk further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points? So that's, and I guess I meant to address that by saying, as we watch, we'll see what's happening.

 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..Ahead of this afternoon's expected decision from the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes, the latest PPI data only solidify any doubts some might've had about whether the central bank has a case to sit tight on interest rates this month..He noted that unemployment, at 3.7%, remains much lower than what the Fed has anticipated..Meanwhile, economic growth actually appears to be picking up, he said, citing a recent forecast from the International Monetary Fund..What's more, bank lending, home prices and stock prices have all begun to increase again, he said..In addition to an apparent slowdown in price increases, the labor market is also showing signs of weakness, he said, citing higher jobless claims, reduced hours worked and lower demand for temporary payrolls..Another Fed official stands squarely in the wait-and-see corner..The CPI data yesterday was pretty much bang in line so nothing there to challenge this outlook."".That’s a big deal to Fed officials who have spoken publicly about their fears of a wage-price spiral — the feedback loop that drives inflation higher as people make more money and go out and spend it..In comments late last year, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook told a crowd in Michigan that “innovation and productivity growth undergird our long-term growth prospects.”
 Over the long run, labor productivity “means everything” to the economy, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM US..Policy-makers at the end of their two-day meeting may well signal more rate increases are still to come once they take time to assess how the economy is evolving, whether the financial system remains stable, and if inflation is continuing to fall..Data since the last Fed meeting in early May has left policy-makers with a tough set of signals to read, and ample room for debate..The economy continues to generate strong monthly job and wage gains, and one of the U.S. central bank’s more closely watched measures – the ratio of open jobs to the number of unemployed – rose recently in a sign the labour market remains misaligned between the demand for workers and those available..Yet some forward-looking price measures show inflation may be set to fall sharply in coming months; the unemployment rate jumped significantly, from 3.4 per cent to 3.7 per cent, in May; and the year-to-year growth rate in bank lending is plummeting towards zero, part of a credit slowdown the Fed is watching carefully for signs of financial industry stress..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..Market expectations are that the growth outlook likely will improve, even though the Fed's own economists said in March and June that they expect a credit contraction to trigger a shallow recession later this year..Communication from the Fed, then, likely will be, ""We're not convinced that this is the end of the rate hikes, but we want to take a look around see what kind of damage the banking crisis has inflicted on the economy,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics..(CNN, POOL)

2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:40:00," Good afternoon, everyone. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We've raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. We've covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we are in a position to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations. Recent readings on consumer spending have been particularly robust. Activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat that would remain well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, or SEP, committee participants revised up their assessments of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1%. Participants expect growth to cool with the median projection falling to 1.5% next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless well below that scene earlier in the year. The unemployment rate ticked up in August, but remains low at 3.8%. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 3.8% at the end of this year to 4.1% over the next two years. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Based on the consumer price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3.4% over the 12 months ending in August. In that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9%. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Nevertheless, the process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2% has a long way to go. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3% this year, falls to 2.5% next year, and reaches 2% in 2026. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25%. We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal over time. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely. Sorry, the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects at the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6% at the end of this year, 5.1% at the end of 2024, and 3.9% at the end of 2025. Compared with our June summary of economic projections, the median projection is unrevised for the end of this year, but has moved up by a half percentage point at the end of the next two years. These projections, of course, are not a committee's decision or plan if the economy does not evolve as projected the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks. Real interest rates now are well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties in precisely gauging the stance of policy. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objective. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary sub-policy affects economic activity and inflation, economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. What makes the committee inclined to think that the Fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year. There's noted uncertainty about policy lags. Headwinds have emerged from the looming government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments, things of that nature. So I guess I would characterize the situation a little bit differently. So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is at five and a quarter to five and a half percent while continuing to reduce our security holdings. And we say we're committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation at two percent of our time. We said that. But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean that we've decided that we have or have not at this time reached that stance of monetary policy that we're seeking. If you looked at the SEP, as you obviously will have done, you will see that majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will be appropriate for us to raise rates.",0.0015138848091827,0.0034598163809867,119,2023-09-20,True,False,False,False,-0.0032687842376969,Negative,Positive,"Job

2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 18:40:00,2023-09-20 18:50:00, more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already reached that. So it's something where we're by by we're not making a decision by by deciding to about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data. So right now it's still an open question about sufficiently restrictive you're not saying today that we've reached this level. We're not saying no. No clearly we are just what we decided it was maintain the policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level and then you know we're we're seeing progress and we welcome that but you know we need to see more progress before we'll be willing to to reach that conclusion. And just on the 2024 projections what's behind that shallow path for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher. Right so I would say it this way for first of all interest rates real interest rates are positive now they're meaningfully positive and that's a good thing we need a policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target okay and we need that we're going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think you know remember that the of course the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed really as a plan it's accumulation really and what you see are the medians. It's accumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people and then what you're seeing are the medians so I wouldn't want to you know bestow upon it the idea that it's really a plan but what it reflects though is that economic activity has been stronger than we expected stronger than I think everyone expected and and so what you're what you're seeing is this is what people believe as of now will be appropriate to achieve what we're looking to achieve which is progress toward our toward our inflation goal as you see in the SEP. Hi Chair Powell Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post thanks for taking our questions how would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding study is it discussion around lag times fear of too much slowing too little slowing could you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting. Yeah so the proposal at the meeting was to was to maintain our current policy stance and and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that but this of course is an SEP meeting and so people write down what they think and you've got you have some you saw I think seven wrote down no hike at this at this meeting or between now and the end of the year and I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the year so it wasn't like we were arguing over that people just stating their positions and really what what people are saying is let's see how the data come in you know we want to see you know we want to see we want to see that that this these good inflation readings that we've been seeing for the last three months we want to see that it's more than just three months right we want to see you know the the labor market report that we received the last one that received was a good example of we do what we do want to see it was a combination of you know of across a broad range of indicators continuing rebalancing of the labor market so those are the two things those are two mandate variables and and that's that's the progress that we want to see but I think people they want to be convinced you know they want to be careful to not to jump to a conclusion really one way or the other but just be convinced that the data you know support that conclusion and that's why given how far we've come and how quickly we've come we're actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting by meeting and in your view what would I know nothing has been decided yet but what would one more hike at the end of the year due to the economy or to inflation on and on the other side what would no hike do if you could sort of game that out for us so you know you can make the argument that one hike one where the other won't matter but for us we're trying we obviously as a group it's a pretty tight cluster of of where we think that that policy stance might be but we're always going to be learning from data you know we've learned all through the course of the last year that actually we needed to go further than we had thought if you go back a year and what we thought what we wrote down it's actually gotten higher and higher so we don't really know and until and that's why again we've grown a position to proceed carefully at this point a year ago we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up now now we're fairly close we think to where we need to get it's just a question of reaching the right stance I wouldn't attribute huge importance to one hike in macroeconomic terms nonetheless you know we need we need to get to a place where we're confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2% over time that's what we need to get to and we've been you know we've been moving toward it as we've gotten closer to it we slowed the pace at which we've moved I think that was appropriate and now that we're getting closer we again we have the ability to proceed carefully see please miss Ian be seen miss share I want to return to Colby's question here what is it saying about the committee's view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a point over the funds rate on it does it tell you that there's tell us that the committee believes inflation to be more persistent requires more medicine effectively and I guess a related question is if you're going to project a funds rate above the longer run rate for four years in a row at what point do we start to think hey maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher thank you so I guess I would point more to rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent I wouldn't think that's not we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year but I wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data it's more about stronger economic activity I would say so if I had to attribute one thing again we're we're picking a median here and trying to attribute one explanation but I think broadly stronger economic activity means means rates we have to do more with rates and that's what that that's what that meaning is telling you in terms of what the neutral rate can be you know we know it by its works we only know it by its works really we can't we can't you know the models and that we use you ultimately you only know when you get there and by by the way the economy reacts and again that's another reason why we're we're moving carefully now because you know there are lags here so that it may it may of course be that the that the neutral rate has risen you do see people you don't see the median moving but you do see people raising their estimates of the neutral rate and it's certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than then the longer run rate remember what we write down in the SCP is the longer run rate it is certainly possible that you know that the that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that and that that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than than expected. Let's go ahead Howard. Howard Shetty with Rodgers thank you so you've said several times that the economy needed a period of below trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2 percent you kind of get that in 2024 a little bit 1.5 percent is just a touch below what's the estimate of potential so the fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost does that represent a change in how you think inflation works and change in how you think the economy works a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this. Yes of course it is a it is a good thing that we we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment and that's that's because we're seeing that rebalancing in other places in for example job openings and in the jobs worker gap you've also seen supply side things so that's happening. I would say though we still I still think and I think broadly people still think that we'll have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply as we've seen as well. Also remember the natural rate we think is coming down which is a supply side thing so that the gap between any given unemployment rate that's lower than that and the natural rate comes down that's a way for supply that's a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance. So all of those things are happening you're right in in the median forecast we don't see a big increase in unemployment we do see an increase and but that's that really is just playing forward the trends that we've been seeing that is not guaranteed there there may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that but that's that's really what we've been seeing is progress without higher unemployment for now. So just to to boil that down for a second you know we've gone from a very narrow path to a to a soft landing to something different would you call the soft landing now a baseline expectation? No no I would not do that I would just say what would I say about that I've always thought that the soft landing was was a plaza,-0.0026622146015702,0.0030656455389767,120,2023-09-20,True,True,False,False,-0.0032687842376969,Negative,Negative,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT September 20, 2023

It's also possible that the path is narrowed and it's widened, apparently, ultimately, this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day. But I do think it's possible. And I also think this is why we're a physician to move carefully again. That we will restore price stability. We know that we have to do that. Then we know that public depends on us doing that. And we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is an extended period, sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We know that. The fact that we've come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying. So I think, you know, that's the end we're trying to achieve. I wouldn't want to handicap the likelihood of it, though. It's not up to me to do that. Nick. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, both you and Vice Chair Williams have indicated that sufficiently restrictive will be judged on a real rather than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year provided further compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside. Is the FOMC focused on targeting a real level of policy restriction? And can you explain what would constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive? I mean, yes, we understand that it's a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And again, I would say you know, you know sufficiently restrictive only when you see it. It's not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or in various estimates. And so what are we seeing? We're seeing, you know, through a combination of the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policies work in suppressing demand or alleviating very high demand. The combination of those two things is actually working. You're seeing, you know, inflation coming down. It's principally now in goods also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in non-housing services as well. So I think we think that that is working. And I think, well, you know, as we've said, we want to reach that, we want to reach something that we're confident gets us to that level. And I think confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, yes, okay, this feels like we can, we can for now decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here. We're not permanently deciding not to go higher, but we would, let's say if we get to that level. And then the question is how long do you stay at that level? And that's a whole other set of questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there. And we haven't, we haven't gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That's what, that's the stage we're at, though. It looks like there was because there wasn't across the board drop in the core PCE projection, core PCE inflation projection for this year. And even then it seems possible the core PCE inflation could come and even lower than the media and at 3.7%. Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation precedes somewhat better than you then you currently anticipate? The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and certainly at the last two meetings this year, it's going to depend on the totality of all the data. So the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks and the other events that are happening out there. We'll make, we take all of that into account. So I can't really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It'll, it'll be trying to reach a judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that would increase our confidence that, that yes, this is an appropriate movement. It will help, help us be more confident that we've gotten to the level that we need to get to. Thanks, Chair Powell. Following up on next question actually, John Williams, the New York Fed president obviously, has said things to the effect of next year as we see inflation kind of again to next point as we see inflation coming down. We're going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we're not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time. And I wonder if that's basically the logic that you apply, you know, is that how you think about it. And then I also wonder in the last press conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, it's a full year out, those discussions and people interpreted that to mean that you didn't see a possibility of a rate cut in the first half of next year. And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you know, how you're thinking about that timing. No, when, so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about about cutting, I'm never intending to send a signal about timing. I'm just answering them as, as the question is expressed. So, so please, I wouldn't want to be taken away. Sorry, the first question was that, Helm. Yeah, so we're, as we go into next year, that's the question we'll be asking is, you know, taking into account lags and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy. The time will come at some point. And I'm not saying when, that it's appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down. Part of it just may be that it'll be all the factors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point. And what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead estimates of what that might be. And, you know, there's, you know, there's so much uncertainty around that. When we, in the moment, will do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this and say, hey, we made a plan. It's not like that at all. It's, it, this is, these are estimates made a year in advance that are highly uncertain. And that's how it is. Thanks so much, Chair Powell, Neil Irwin with Axios. I wonder how do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we've been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supply side factors productivity labor force growth. And, relatedly, if GDP keeps coming in hot, even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own be a reason to consider more tightening. So, on your first question, I mean, we're looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what's the direction of it, what's what's driving it. And it's a lot of consumer spending, you know, it's been the consumer's been very robust in its in spending. So, that is, you know, that's how we're looking at it. Sorry, your second question was, there's GDP stays hot, but without inflation. So, I think the question will be, GDP is not a mandate, right? Maximum employment and price stability of the mandates. The question will be is, is the, is GDP is the heat that we see in GDP? Is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation? That's going to be the question. It's not, it's not a question about GDP on its own. It's, you know, you're expecting to see this improvement, you know, continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2% in a sustainable way. We have to have confidence in that. And, you know, we'd be looking at GDP just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we do it with Politico. There are multiple external factors that are playing out right now. We see rising oil prices, we see auto workers striking, where there's the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering for each of those things, could you talk about how you're thinking about how that might affect the course for the Fed and the economy? So there's a, there is a long list and you hit some of them, but you know, it's, it's the strike, it's government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long term rates, oil price shock, you know, you can, there are a lot of things that you can, you can look at. And, you know, so what we try to do is assess all of them and, and the handicap all of them. And ultimately though, there's so much uncertainty around, around these things. And we have to start with the strike. First of all, we absolutely don't comment on the strike as we have no view on the strike one way or the other way. We do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the thing about it is so uncertain, it will depend, the economic effects, it could affect, you look, we've looked back at history, it could affect economic output, hiring and inflation. And then, I don't know how broad it is and how long it's sustained for. And then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production. So none of those things are known right now. It's very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that uncertain and, and we'll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period. Much more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, I don't know if you mentioned shutdown. I think of all of these as being on the list. We don't comment on that. It hasn't traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect. You know, energy prices being higher, that's, that is a significant thing. We, energy prices being up can affect spending, it can affect, over time. A sustained period of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.

We have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well. Those are some of mine a much if I hit them all. But ultimately, you're coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum. And that's what we start with, but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. I was a little surprised, Chair Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy seeing added supply and a weight that could create long term inflation stability. We have primage labor force participation moving up where people can add skills. Workers want to work. We have a boom in manufacturing construction. We've had a decent spade of home building. And since inflation is coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity. All are which good for the feds longer run target of low inflation. And if we lose that in a recession, aren't we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into account as you pursue policy? Thank you. To begin, a soft landing is a primary objective and I did not say otherwise. I mean, that's what we've been trying to achieve for all this time. The real point though is the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability because the record is clear on that. If you don't restore price stability, inflation comes back and you go through what you can have a long period where the economy is just very uncertain and it will affect growth. It will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the fed coming in and having to tighten again and again. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability. I think now, today, we actually, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully and that's what we're planning to do. So we fully appreciate the benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing an important large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So. It's good, Chris. Hi. Thank you, Chris Ruege, Brad, Associated Press. When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling the low-hanging fruit, such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions or is it more of a broad, disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the economy? Thank you. So if I understood your question, it's, I would say it this way. I think we knew from the time, from before when we lifted off, it's certainly by the time we lit, we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going to help. It was going to help supply side heal by cooling demand off. And just in general, a lot better aligning supply with demand. So those two forces were always going to be important. I think it's very hard to pull them apart. They work together. I do think both of them are at work now. And I think they're at work in a way that shows you the progress that we are seeing. Michael McKeefer, Bloomberg Television Radio. In June, you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median Fed funds rate. And since then, you've more than doubled your growth forecast. You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So what would justify that last move because the median forecast is for lower inflation. And given all the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have or the American people have in your forecasts? Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult. Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to your question, though, what's happened is growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected. And that's required higher rates. Unemployment, you know, you also see that the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high. But that's really because of what we've been seeing in the labor market. We've seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment. So we're continuing that trend. In terms of inflation, you are seeing the last three readings are very good readings. It's only three readings. You know, we were well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look at June, July and August, you're looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the good sector, also to some extent, in housing services and just a little in non-housing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think people should know that economic forecasting is very difficult and these are highly uncertain forecasts. But these are our forecasts. They're, you know, they're, they're, they're, we have very high quality people working on these forecasts. And I think they stand up well against other forecasters, but just the nature of the businesses, the economy is very difficult to forecast. Given the forecast that you have, what justified not moving today and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in? Well, I think we have come very far, very fast in the rate increases that we've made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly and we did. And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2% over time, you know, the risks become more to side it. And the risk of overtighting and the risk of under tightening that becomes more equal. And I think that the natural common sense thing to do is as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it. And that's what we're doing. So we're, we're taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we, as we, as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2%. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. With your focus on your over your PCE, isn't it true that base effects are huge and that by the time you meet in November, that it's more likely that you'll have a low PCE number that would make you feel more comfortable? And secondly, how would the lack of key indicators like CPI, the jobs report impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to have a government shutdown? Thank you. Sorry. I missed the first question. What was it miss? What's factors? The base factors. Base factors. Okay. So on that, you know, we're looking at just monthly, right, you can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior month. So you're right, when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you could base factors, but we can, we can, we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data, you know, again, we don't, we don't comment on government shutdowns. It, it's possible. If there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it's possible we wouldn't, we wouldn't be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get. And we, you know, we would just have to deal with that. And I don't know, it's hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don't know about now, but it's certainly a reality that that, that's a possibility. What would you feel more comfortable on the base effects that as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, would you feel uncomfortable at that point? You know, yes, I mean, if you're looking, if we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And, you know, that's what we're looking at. And month by month, what's the reading? And, you know, I think, I think what we're really looking at is, there's a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but they're incredibly volatile and they can be misleading. That's why we look at 12 months. But I think in this situation where it looks like we've had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June, we're also looking at six months and even three months, but really six months inflation. So you're looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That's the right way to go. And we don't need to be in a hurry in getting to a conclusion about what to do. We can let the data evolve. So. Thanks for the question. Chair Powell, Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We're seeing oil prices, as you mentioned, move up and that's pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not? Because the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we've seen the overall inflation is actually risen. Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer. This can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.

 Inflation has slowed steadily from its four-decade peak last June, and it could ease all the way to the Fed’s 2% target without a sharp uptick in unemployment — a scenario known as a “soft landing.” Or, inflation could eventually drift down to 2%, but with the economy slipping into a recession as unemployment rises..Some Fed officials are optimistic they can pull off a soft landing, but the central bank has to contend with a number of uncertainties and economic headwinds in the coming months, including the resumption of student loan payments next month, rising energy costs threatening core inflation’s slowdown, consumer fatigue from high inflation and the delayed effects of previous rate hikes on the broader, real economy..In his post-meeting news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a soft landing “was a plausible outcome” and that a soft landing could be jeopardized by “factors that are outside of our control.”
 After a reporter’s question suggested that a soft landing isn’t a goal of the Fed’s, Powell said the central bank has always been aiming to achieve the elusive soft landing..If you don’t restore price stability, inflation comes back.”
 Markets stumbled after Powell’s remarks on the soft landing possibility..He said that officials determine whether the strength of GDP is “a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation.”
 Economists widely expect slower growth this year, rather than an economic slump..We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at core inflation, so the question is, how long will those higher prices sustain?”

2023-09-20 18:30:00,2023-09-20 19:10:00,2023-09-20 19:20:00," prices are one of the big things that affects consumer sentiment. It really comes down to how persistent, how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn't, energy prices mostly, mostly don't contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don't tell you much about where inflation is really going. However, we're well aware, though, that, you know, if an energy price is the increase and stay high, that'll have an effect on spending. And it may have an effect on consumer expectations of inflation and things like that. That's just things we have to monitor. So, on the consumer, they're putting more and more of this on their credit card. The consumer seeing, you know, a record credit spending, how long do you think that consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned about a debt bubble related to that? So, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that's why we tend to look through energy moves that we can see as short-term volatility. You know, we're turning to consumer credit. You know, of course, we watch that carefully, consumer distress, measures of distress among consumers, where it historic lows quite recently, you know, after, during and after the pandemic, they're now moving back up to normal. We're watching that carefully. But at this point, these readings are not, they're not at troublingly high levels. They're just kind of moving back up to what was the typical in the pre-pandemic era. Hi, Jean Young with M&I Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve have risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed's view about what's been driving that increase in recent weeks? And how much of it can be attributed to macro-explanations and how much to technical factors? So, you're right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I think it's always hard to say precisely. But it's, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they'll, the view will be it's not, it's not mostly about inflation expectations. It's mostly about other things, you know, either term premium or real yields. And it's hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone's got models that will give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers. So, but essentially, they're moving up because it's not because of inflation. It's because probably it'll probably have something to do with stronger growth. I would say more more supply of treasuries, you know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense. Kyle Campbell, American banker, thank you for taking the questions. Just two on housing. You've said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed. But there's also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market. So my question is how much of the effort to tame inflation both as it's measured and felt by the broader public hinges on housing supply. And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future? So on the supply point, of course supply is very important over time in setting house prices and for that matter rents. And so supply is kind of structurally constrained. But in terms of where inflation is going in the near term though, as you obviously know, a lot of it is leases that are running off and then being resigned or released at a level that's not as high, it won't be that much higher. A year ago would have been much higher than it was a year before. Now it may be below or at the same level. So as those leases are rolling over, we're seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins. How much is that affecting things, really? The second effect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that bubble of buying and then a lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market. I think we look at the, I would look at the lock-in. The idea being that people are in very low mortgages, very low rate mortgages. And even if they want to move now, they would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive. And that's explaining some of that's one of the explanations for what's happening broadly in the labor market. Would that play a role in our future decisions in a future tight, in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I don't think it would. I mean, I don't think that's, I think we'd be looking at what fundamentally what rates does the economy need. In an emergency like the pandemic or during the global financial crisis, you have to cut rates to the point that you have to do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn't think that that would be a reason for us not to do that. It's not something we're thinking about at all right now, but down the road I wouldn't think so. Nancy. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Gencer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, you've mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence, maybe cut back, consumer spending, possible government shutdown, high gas prices. At this point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending? Would that help you get inflation closer to you to present target? I wouldn't say it that way. We're not looking for a decrease in consumer spending. It's a good thing that the economy is strong. It's a good thing that the economy has been able to hold up under the tightening that we've done. It's a good thing that the labor market's strong. The only concern, it just means this, if the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we'll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent, because we will get back to 2 percent. Is that answer your question? Yeah, and I guess on the other hand, would you worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession? Well, that's always a concern. I mean, concern number one is restoring price stability, because in the long run, that's something we have to do so that we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight labor market conditions that benefit all, as I've said a couple times. So, that said, of course, we also now, given how far we've come with our rate hikes and how quickly we've come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of that consideration. Thank you, Chair Powell, Simon, or Benavitch with the Economist. One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of rate sensitivity than in the past. Obviously, we've talked about households with long fixed rate mortgages, also companies that refinanced before last year. What is your thinking about the efficacy of rates and how that's changed? And then related to that, how do you think about the distributional consequences in the sense that if you're a relatively wealthy household with a long fixed rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going that poor as if you're relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption. In fact, times are getting a lot tougher a lot more quickly. Thanks. So, what? I guess it's fair to say that the economy has been stronger than many expected, given what's been happening with interest rates. Why is that? Many candidate explanations, possibly a number of them make sense. One is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had understood. And so that that spending is held up and that kind of thing. We're not sure about that. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that's sustainable. That could be, you could just mean that the date of effect is later. It could also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is higher for various reasons. We don't know that. It could also just be that policy hasn't been restrictive enough for long enough. And there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in all this uncertainty, make policy. And I feel like what we have right now is what's still a very strong labor market, but that's coming back into balance. We were making progress on inflation. Growth is strong, but I think by many forecasts, many, many forecasts call for growth to moderate over the course of the next year. So that's where we are. And we have to deal with what comes.

 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective September 21, 2023..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted

 So far, the economy has been remarkably resilient in the face of the Fed’s most aggressive inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s..The Consumer Price Index rose 3.7% in August from a year earlier, up from July’s 3.2% rise, with gas prices being the largest contributor to that acceleration..Rising energy prices, if elevated for long enough, could eventually feed into core inflation by making services such as freight and air transportation more expensive..“Energy prices being up can affect spending over time, a sustained period of higher energy prices can affect consumers’ expectations about inflation..We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at core inflation, so the question is, how long will those higher prices sustain?”
 Some economists expect demand to slow the rest of the year, helping ease some upward pressure on gas prices..How much those values shift, particularly around the rate cuts envisioned next year, and what the first glimpse of 2026 says about the longer-run outlook, will amount to a tacit vote on whether the Fed’s faith in the soft landing, a scenario in which inflation falls without major job losses or a recession, has grown stronger because of the economy’s resilience, or weaker because of concern that price pressures might persist and force an even tighter policy stance..Recent data on prices showed inflation picking up speed, but for reasons, such as high energy costs, that will likely fade, and the pace of trend inflation still moderating..Another gauge of inflation — the Consumer Price Index on a ""core"" basis — rose 4.3% in August, slowing from 4.7% in July, its slowest pace since October 2021..US bond yields surging to 16-year high levels and fears of high crude oil prices fueling commodity inflation also hit the investor sentiment, according to analysts..Concerns reigned over upcoming Fed policy, interest rate trajectory and rising oil prices..High gas prices are a headache for elected officials and consumers, particularly less affluent Americans, and they present a challenge for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who have sought to rein in rapid inflation over the past 18 months..Last week, the latest consumer and producer price index reports suggested that inflationary pressures are continuing, but at a moderate level..So far, consumer inflation, measured year over year, has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in June of last year to 3.7% in August..Yet the path back to lower inflation has already become more uneven: On a monthly basis, consumer prices jumped 0.6% in August, the most in more than a year.",0.6435,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT September 20, 2023

The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a fixed income. If you're a person who spends all of your income, you don't really have any meaningful savings. You spend all your income on the basics of life, clothing, food, transportation, heating, the basics. And prices go up by 5, 6, 7%. Your income will right away, whereas even middle class people have some savings and some ability to absorb that. So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability. And we want to do it as quickly as possible. Obviously, we would like to do that. We'd like the current trend to continue, which is that we're making progress without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that we've seen in past things. But you're right, though. When we raise rates, people who are living on credit cards and borrowing are going to feel that more. They are. And of course, people with lots of savings also have a much lower marginal propensity to consume. And so it's not going to affect them as much. Let's go to Greg Robb for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from Markowatch. In the beige book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying non-profits and community groups about the economic health of low-income Americans, moderate groups of Americans. I have two questions about this. Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with a quarterly survey of those groups, like the senior loan officer survey? And also the second question is, from your recent readings of these surveys, how are low- and moderate Americans doing? Is there this thing where the GDP is strong because of wealthy Americans kind of driving things? And just want to get your sense of the health of that sector. Thank you. So I don't know about the quarterly survey. That's an idea we can take away and think about. In terms of how low- and moderate Americans, they're clearly we're suffering from high inflation. I think during the pandemic, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And if you know the surveys that we take showed that low and moderate income people were actually in very, very strong financial condition. I think now it's a very hot labor market. And you're seeing high nominal wages. And you're starting to see real wages are now positive by most measures. So I think overall households are in good shape. Surveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction. And I think a lot of that is just people hate inflation, hate it. And that causes people to say the economy is terrible. But at the same time, they're spending money. Their behavior is not exactly what you would expect from the surveys. That's kind of a guess at what the answer might be. But I think there's a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets. And certainly in the labor market and with wages, the biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low wage jobs. And now inflation coming down, you're seeing real wages, which is a good thing.

 So far, the economy has been remarkably resilient in the face of the Fed’s most aggressive inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s..The release of the updated projections will force Fed policy-makers to show if they believe a recent run of good data can continue, or whether even more restrictive monetary policy will be needed

 Confident the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged, investors are far more focused on the release of new forecasts on Wednesday that will reveal how much U.S. central bank policy-makers buy into the prospect of an economic “soft landing” and what rate environment will prevail alongside it..But beyond that, the release of the updated Summary of Economic Projections will force Fed policy-makers to show if they believe a recent run of good data can continue – with inflation slowing alongside stronger-than-anticipated job and economic growth – or whether even more restrictive monetary policy will be needed to finish the fight against rising prices despite the risks that brings of a hard stop to the post-pandemic economic expansion..How much those values shift, particularly around the rate cuts envisioned next year, and what the first glimpse of 2026 says about the longer-run outlook, will amount to a tacit vote on whether the Fed’s faith in the soft landing, a scenario in which inflation falls without major job losses or a recession, has grown stronger because of the economy’s resilience, or weaker because of concern that price pressures might persist and force an even tighter policy stance..Given how the economy is behaving, the Fed “may need to raise rates further (or) need to hold policy tighter for longer” in order to slow the economy, Davis said, adding that a “soft landing is still possible, but not probable.”
 
 
 The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady on Wednesday while releasing new economic forecasts that could offer clues about future actions from the central bank..Political consequences of the Fed’s inflation fight are also materializing for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, with Republicans grumbling that central bankers got started raising interest rates too late..“When you raise interest rates, it becomes more expensive for businesses to borrow, so that cuts into their profitability and they cut their borrowing,” Bhuyian said..The high interest rates could further squeeze consumers who are already facing the reemergence of student loans..By pulling its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades, the Fed has helped inflation to cool from its peak last year but at the cost of hurting prices for investments and damaging some corners of the economy..Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave interest rates unchanged at their meeting on Wednesday, buying themselves more time to assess whether borrowing costs are high enough to weigh down the economy and wrestle inflation under control..Central bankers have already raised interest rates to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, the highest level in 22 years..By making it more expensive to borrow to buy a house or expand a business, they are trying to slow demand across the economy, making it harder for companies to charge more without losing customers and slowing price increases..Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re now inclined to move more gradually and cautiously toward their goal of 2% annual inflation..Their more deliberative approach follows the 11 rate hikes they unleashed beginning in March 2022, which substantially raised borrowing costs for consumers and businesses..In raising its short-term interest rate at the fastest pace in four decades, the Fed has sought to moderate borrowing and spending, slow the economy and tame inflation.",0.5987,"{

2024-01-31 19:30:00,2024-01-31 19:30:00,2024-01-31 19:40:00," Good afternoon. My colleague is and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high on going progress in bringing it down is not assured. In the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory and we've been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3%. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1%. Bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past 3 months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that's seen a year ago, but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome, but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% of points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. This labor market tightness has eased, and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer run, longer term, inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions. Thank you. I think we're taking our questions. Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you don't want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming down fully. I wonder what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? As you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth and consumer spending data against the solid inflation progress you've been seeing? Sorry, I see that last 40 years. How are you weighing the growth data and consumption data which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data? Okay. So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We're looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And, implicitly, we do have confidence and has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It's not that we're looking for better data. It's that we're looking at continuation of the good data that we've been seeing. And a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that's six months of good inflation data. Is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a sustainable path down to 2% inflation? That's the question. And the answer will come from some more data that's also good data. It's not that the six month data isn't low enough. It is. It's just the question of, can we take that with confidence that we're moving sustainably down to 2%. That's really what we're thinking about. In terms of growth, we've had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth, very strong growth last year, going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down. So I think, whereas a year ago, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening and economic activity. That hasn't been the case. So I think we look at stronger growth, we don't look at it as a problem. I think at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We're not looking for a weaker labor market. We're looking for inflation to continue to come down as it has been coming down for the last six months. And I'm sorry if I could just follow up very quickly. When you say that you want to make sure that the true signal is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it's a true signal at this stage? No, I think it's, I would say it seems to be the likely case that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it and we haven't yet. And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have six months of good inflation, but you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative. It's a reasonable assumption that over time goods inflation will flatten out, probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number, not so much the composition, but we just need to see more. That's where we are as a committee. We need to see more evidence that sort of confirms.",0.0037642702869485,0.0050017495831875,136,2024-01-31,True,True,False,False,-0.0021541554684775,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024

Powell, the Fed’s chair, said that the country had “six good months” of moderating inflation, but officials wanted to see continued progress before lowering rates..“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Mr. Powell said..The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates at their current levels on Wednesday amid improving consumer confidence and a declining inflation rate..In the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, some Fed officials have been signaling that the current rate has been enough to knock inflation down toward the central bank's 2% target..In remarks this month, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that slowing inflation, combined with continued steady employment gains had led to an economic landscape that was “almost as good as it gets.”
 “The progress I have noted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2%,” he said in written remarks to the Brookings Institution, according to The Associated Press..""It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates."".The Fed is largely expected to hold interest rates steady at multi-decade highs, but investors are turning their attention to any signs of when — and how much — the central bank will turn to rate cuts, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports..The increase in wages and benefits was still mostly healthy, but the slowdown could contribute to the cooling of inflation and will likely be welcomed by Federal Reserve policymakers..The Real Fed Policy Rate

2024-01-31 19:30:00,2024-01-31 19:40:00,2024-01-31 19:50:00," what we think we're seeing and that tells us that we are on gives us confidence that we're on on a path to a single path down to 2% inflation Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal Sure pal it seems to me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons one Was the risk of a wage price viral to there were risks of inflation expectations becoming on anchor This morning's ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private sector payroll growth running at a sub 4% pace inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation emergency of the last three years and given that you appear to have substantially cut off these two tail risks and that you've judged Here today current policy is well into restrictive territory What good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5% are you really going to learn more waiting Six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks so As you know Almost every participant on the committee does believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and For partly for the reasons that you say you know, we feel like inflation is coming down Growth has been strong the labor market is strong We're what we're trying to do is identify a place where we're really confident about inflation get it getting back Then 2% so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level So overall I think I think people do believe and as you know the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting a process we need some confirmation that inflation isn't that coming down Sustainably to 2% if I could ask differently if you hold rates high as inflation moderates as it has been Target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or experience What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by those rules in the current incidents? Well, I look I think as you know we consult the range of Taylor rules and non-tailor kind of rules we consult them regularly they're in our our teal book and and They're in all the materials that we look at but you know I don't think we've ever been at a state at a place where we were we were setting policy by them And they're depending on the rule It will tell you different things are many different formulations another way to think about it is implicitly is so In theory of course real rates go up if holding all else equal as inflation comes down But that doesn't mean we can mechanically adjust policy as real rates Sorry as inflation comes down doesn't mean that at all because for one thing We we don't know we look at more than just the Fed fundsery we look at broadly financial conditions But in addition we don't know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is in any given time But that also doesn't mean that we wait around for To see you know the economy turned down because that will be too late So we're really in a risk management mode of managing the risk as I mentioned in my opening remarks managing the risk that we move too soon and Would move too late and I think to move which is which is where Almost everyone in the committee is is in favor of of moving rates down this year But the timing of that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2% I Thanks, Chair Bill I'd like you to to key it on the use of the word in the statement that inflation still remains elevated You've pledged to cut rates before inflation reached 2% So that implies that there's some sort of intermediate step here or on inflation and that Cut would be consequent with a change in the statement language that Inflation remains elevated. What's the step down from there? Yeah, I don't know that we worked out the particular Statement language and that kind of thing I would just say if you look at you look at where we're 12-month inflation is and It's you know, it's still well above core is 2.9% for example 12 months Which is way down from where it was very very positive development very fast decline and and you know I the the cases likely that it will continue to come down so so that's where that's where it is But we're we know we're wanting to see you know more data So if I could follow up on that this statement allows that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut But it doesn't mention the other side of the mandate a slighted employment would a slighted employment also Bring you to the point of cutting rates Yes, so Let me say that we're not looking for that's not something we're looking for But yes, if you think about you know in the base case The economy is performing well the labor market remains strong if we saw an unexpected weakening in in certainly in the labor market that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner Absolutely, and if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or Those sorts of things would argue for moving later In the base case though, we're where the economy is healthy and we have as you know, we have ongoing growth solid growth We have a strong labor market. We have inflation coming down That's what people are writing their SEP around and in that case what we're saying is Based on that we think we can and should Take advantage of that and and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction Okay Claude Jones financial times just a circle back to The greater confidence aspect of the statement There's been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings and just wondering going forward when it comes to All needing greater confidence Is the unanimity or at least consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater confidence is and if not could you maybe Tell us a little bit about the discussion today on you know what the Variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that Greater confidence threshold could be reached. Thank you. We're not we're not really at that stage You know, we're we're there was no proposal to cut rates Some people did you know talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the SEP as You know as good evidence of where people are although it is it is one cycle later so you know We're not we're not at a place of really working out those kinds of details because we weren't actively considering you know a Moving moving the federal funds rate down. I will say there's a there is a wide disparity a healthy disparity of views and you see that in Public public statements in the minutes and the transcripts when they're released every five years So we do have a healthy set of differences and I think that's actually essential for making good policy We're also able to reach agreement generally because we listen to each other we we compromise and even though not everybody loves What we do they're able to for the most part able to join in to me that's a that's a well-functioning public institution Rachel Hi, chair pal Rachel Seagal from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions So over the past few years there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was like Open table data or office attendance. You've talked about vacancies in the past And I'm wondering at the start of this year what might be on that dashboard for you that's giving you the clearest picture of the economy Including on runs if you could touch on that including rent rent costs. Yeah, well, so we're not you know, it's not the pandemic So we can actually rely on more more traditional forms people are working. They're getting wages and And the economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing as you see So I wouldn't say we're looking at that that sort of more innovative data as much You know you point to rent so of course we follow the components of inflation very carefully Which would be goods inflation? I talked about that a little bit you mentioned housing inflation So the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rent Statement as measured measured in PCE inflation and we think that's coming and we know it's coming It's just a question of when and how big it'll be so that's in and everyone's forecast I would say So that will that will help but at the same time we think goods inflation will probably It's been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort and probably that the clients over time But it may well have some some more time to run you know these the supply chains are not Perfectly back to where they were in addition It takes time for the healing process to get into prices So there may be still a tail and we'll find out with with that So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully and as you would imagine I guess this is a quick follow. Do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing or is that part of Looking for more confidence. No, I wouldn't I wouldn't say we've achieved that and I think we have we have we have a ways to go inflation is still You know core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis 12 months is our our target certainly I'm encouraged and we're encouraged by the progress, but you know, we're we're we're not we're not declaring victory at all at this point We think we have a ways to go Thank you, Mr. Chairman You've said",-0.0003073833480194,0.0025833435846967,137,2024-01-31,False,False,False,False,-0.0021541554684775,Negative,Negative,"Job

2024-01-31 19:30:00,2024-01-31 19:50:00,2024-01-31 20:00:00," I said that you would know the neutral rate by its works. So I'm wondering what you could tell me, how do you believe the neutral rate is working, we're telling you right now that growth is stronger. In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? I think you do see in the interest sensitive parts of the economy, you do see, for example, housing, you see the effects. Your second question, though, really, I think, is important. And that is a lot of this has come through a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you've seen that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter policy, which is enabled to supply side to recover. I think that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So we really do think that we're having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it's a joint story. It's a complicated story. But how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy? Would you say relative to the neutral rate? Of course, you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision. But if you, a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate 5.3 percent, let's say, and subtract sort of a forward measure of inflation. If you do that, there are many, many ways to calculate that neutral rate, but that's what I like to do. And you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate, you will. But at the same time, you look at the economy and you say this is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. And you say, what does that tell you about the neutral rate? What's happening, though, is the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that won't go on forever. So a lot of the growth we're seeing is not, it isn't just a tug of war between interest rates and demand. You're getting more activity because of the labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is when that peters out, I think the restriction will show up probably more sharply. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks for taking the question from some experiment. You mentioned earlier we're not seeking a weaker labor market, I think. You said, can you talk a little bit more about that? Do you think the labor market now is back to, quote unquote, normal? And that we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic, even with today's ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic lows. I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal, but not totally back to normal. I think the job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages are, wage increases rather are not quite back to where they would need to be in the longer run. I would look at it this way though. The economy is broadly normalizing and so is the labor market. And that process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens. And you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that's okay. That's okay. But we do see, you saw today's ECI reading, you know, the evidence is that wage increases are still at a healthy level, very healthy level, but they're gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated given assumptions about productivity or more typically associated with 2% inflation. It's an ongoing process, a healthy one, and I think we're moving in the right direction. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically. I think the labor market is, it's rebalancing. Clearly there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened, you remember, 2021, you had a severe labor shortage. It was everywhere panic on a part of businesses couldn't find people. So what's happened is we expected labor, the labor labor market to come back quickly and it didn't. And in 2022 was a disappointing year. And you know, we were kind of thinking, well, maybe we won't get it back. And then 2023, we did. As you know, so labor force participation came back strongly in 23 and so did immigration. Immigration came to a halt during the pandemic. So, and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to will it still a very strong labor market. It's still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it's getting back into balance. And that's what we want to see. And you know, one great way to look at that is what's happening with wage increases. And you see it now across the major things that we track. It isn't every quarter, but overall there's a clear trend still at high levels, but back down to where would be what would be consistent with where we were before the pandemic and with 2% inflation. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruegaber, associated press. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Rich's question. It sounded like you suggested that you're not worried about faster growth so much. So, wanted to see if you're seeing anything that suggests that inflation could reaccelerate from here. And it sounds like you're saying you're not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you. No, I think that is a risk. The risk that inflation would reaccelerate. I think the greater risk is that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2%. That's to me more likely. Of course, if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, we would have to respond to that. And that would be a surprise at this point, but I have to tell you, that's why we keep our options open here and why we're not rushing. So, I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is you've had six good months, very good months. But what's really going to shake out here? When we look back, what will we see? Will inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are one of the factors that won't repeat themselves? We don't think so. We don't, you know, there's not what we think, but that's the question we are asking. We have to ask. And we want to get comfort on that. And just one quick follow up. Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data. Is that something you're watching as well? And if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence where things are going? We'll just have to see. Yeah, we'll, we look at those last year was a, was it a surprise? Michael McKeeblum, Radio and television. If you don't want to use the term soft landing, would you say at least that from your point of view now, the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risk of being a hard landing. And you mentioned below 2% inflation for on a three month basis, core PCE has been running at 1.5%. And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? So, I guess I would just say this executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4% that hasn't happened in 50 years. So it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is, this is a good situation. Let's be honest, this is a, this is a good economy. But what's the outlook? That's looking in the review. The outlook, we do expect growth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time and it hasn't happened. But we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. Labor market is rebalancing. As I mentioned, job creation has slowed the base of job growth has narrowed. And of course, 12 month inflation is above target and getting, you know, getting down closer to target. It's not guaranteed. But we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and questions we have to answer. But overall, it's a pretty good picture. It is a good picture. Your second question was sorry. Could you get inflation that is below target end up with inflation below target and you have to do something about that.

 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective February 1, 2024..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to

 in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level

 The economy expanded faster than expected in the final three months of the year, the government said last week..Growth has been robust even as inflation has sunk ever closer to the Fed’s 2 per cent target..Measured over the past six months, in fact, inflation excluding volatile food and energy costs has slowed to a 1.9 per cent annual rate, according to the Fed’s preferred inflation measure..Policymakers have also made it clear in the last month that they are not in a rush and still need more confirmation that inflation is dropping sustainably to the Fed’s 2% target..The good news for the Fed is that inflation continues to cool..The challenge for the Fed is that economic growth continues to surprise to the upside, clocking in at 3.3% for the fourth quarter..The strong economic numbers could also cause the Fed to hold rates at current levels for longer, as could a run up in the stock market that convinces consumers to spend more..The Fed has held its policy rate in a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent since July, and officials projected in December that they might lower borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point over the course of 2024..On the one hand, inflation has come down more swiftly than many economists had expected in recent months..The Fed’s post-meeting policy statement has suggested that officials will watch economic data “in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate.” Now that further rate increases are looking less and less likely, that language may be in for a tweak.",0.5462,"{

If we have a month or two of lower and we have that now of inflation that's annualized at a lower level, that wouldn't be good. We're not looking to have inflation anchor below 2%, we're looking to have it anchor at 2%. So if we do face those circumstances then we'll have to deal with that. I think as of now the question we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. Edward. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you for Mr. Chair for taking this. So as I've heard from some district Fed presidents, is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner? And then when we do see that first rate cut, is that, should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate cut cycle or is it a one off? So I'll point to that language on your first question. We included that language in the statement to signal clearly that with strong growth, strongly of a market inflation coming down, the committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context, current context, we're going to be data dependent, we're going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that, but that's to be seen. So I wouldn't call, you know, when you say, when you ask me about in the near term, I'm hearing that as March, I would say, I don't think that's probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. Then your second question is on the, is this the start of a, when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle, or is it, you could have just been one off? You know, that's going to depend on the data. The whole thing is this is going to depend on the data. We're going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks. And we're going to make our decisions based on that. And it could wind up, you know, we'll, we'll have another SEP at the March meeting and people will write down what they think. But in the end, it's really going to depend on how the economy evolves. We talked about there are risks that would cause us to go slower. For example, stronger inflation, more, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us to, or if they happen, that would cause us to go faster or sooner. And that would be a weakening in the labor market, or for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation. Those are the kinds of things. So we're just, we're just going to be reacting to the data. That's really the only way we can do this. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth? You know, you've mentioned multiple times about, you know, the level of wage growth that's consistent with 2% inflation. We've obviously seen, you know, you were talking about ECI this morning in which it's cooled a little bit, but still sort of above what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity? And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors, the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about? Or do you think that productivity growth will fade over time? So this is a really interesting question. And I think my own view is, I think if you look back to the pandemic, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off and activity didn't decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough of productivity. And then over the last, you saw high productivity last year in 23. I think we're basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question will be, what is it that has changed the, you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy? Is there, is there a case, will it be the case that we come out of this more productive, more on a sustained basis? And I don't know, I don't know. What would it take? It would take, you know, people talk about AI. But I would, my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were because I'm not sure I see work from home doesn't seem like it's a big productivity increase or AI, artificial intelligence generative may be, but probably not in the short run, probably maybe in the longer run. So I'm not, I'm not seeing why it would, but, you know, right, you know, right now, I would say we're, the productivity is kind of what falls out of the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and activity returning and supply chain is getting fixed. Right. So would that be behind why we've seen such strong growth, but we've also seen inflation fall that maybe there's just a higher level of productivity. That's one way to look at it. Yeah. Nancy. Hi, Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, Gensers with Marketplace. I want to ask a little bit more about housing. I'm wondering how closely are you watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates? And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected. So when we think about, um, you know, our statutory goals are maximum employment and price stability and that's what we're targeting. We're not targeting housing price inflation, the cost of housing or any of those things. Those are very important things for people's lives, but they're not, you know, those are not the things we're targeting. We're also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry. And when we raise rates, the housing industry can be heard because it's a very interesting sensitive sector. On top of that, we have longer run problems with the availability of housing. You know, we have a built up set of cities and, you know, people moving further and further out so that there's, there hasn't been enough housing built. And these are not, these are not things that we have any tools to address. But, you know, it, where it comes into play very specifically in our work is inflation, which is a combination. It's really rental inflation. You're taking owners equivalent rent and then actual rent paid by tenants and you're, you're running that through the CPI calculation or the PCE calculation, the one we look at. And what that's telling you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will show up in inflation over time. It has to, as long as that remains the case. So. And just real quick, what is your response to the letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the Fed to lower interest rates to make housing more affordable? My response is what I started with, which is that our job, the job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is absolutely essential for people's lives most importantly for, well, not most importantly, most, mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges at the margins. And so someone for someone like that high inflation about when the in the necessities of life right away you're in trouble, whereas even middle class people have some, you know, some scope to absorb higher costs. So we have to get it's our job. It's what societies asked us to do is to get inflation down the tools that we use to do it or interest rates. So that's how we think about that. Courtney Brown from Axios. Can you give us some insight into whether the committee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the months ahead? Yes. So. I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has gone very well and as the processes continue, you know, we're getting to that time where questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that. So at this meeting we did have some discussion of the balance sheet and we're planning to begin in-depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March. So those questions are all coming into scope now and we're focusing on them but we're at the beginning of that process I would say. Quick follow-up. Is the case that the Fed would decide to lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet run off in tandem? Yes, we do we see those as independent tools and so they don't, for example, if you're normalizing policy you might be reducing rates but continuing to run off the balance sheet. In both cases that's normalization but from a strict monetary policy standpoint you could say we're loosening and one with tightening. So that could happen. It's not something we're planning or thinking about but right now we're thinking about getting to a place where we're going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue. We're watching it carefully and as I said we'll be looking into that as a committee starting in March. Thanks. Simon. Simon Arbinevich with the economist thank you chair Powell. You've mentioned six good months of inflation data but that not being enough to build up confidence. Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn't start easing yet in March. The implication is that eight good months might not be enough either. Roughly how many months do you think you might need of good inflation data to be to be confident? I'm not in the position to put a number on it I'm just going to say it's not that we don't have any confidence. We have growing confidence but not to the point where we feel like it's a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialing back",-0.0035560123329907,0.0060783989414488,139,2024-01-31,True,True,False,False,-0.0021541554684775,Negative,Negative,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024

And we feel like the strong economy, strong labor market inflation coming down, it gives us the ability to do that. We think that's the best way we can serve the public because ultimately we've made a lot of progress on inflation. We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable way. That's how we're thinking about it. In terms of when that'll be, that'll all come out of our communications. And we won't keep that a secret. Hi, Chair Powell. Evan Reiser with M&I Market News. Can you explain a little bit more on what you're considering when tapering QT? Do you need to see the overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero? Or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there? Not a decision that we've made, but I wouldn't think we wouldn't be taking a position that it's got to go to zero. I mean, if it were to stabilize it a different way, but that's not a decision that we've made. That's what we'll be talking about at the March meeting. A whole range of issues will be briefed up in the committee. We'll get into all of the issues that will be arising over the course of the next, let's say, year or so. Great. Thanks, Craig Grap, from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I want to change gears a little bit. In the presidential primary campaign that's been going on for the last nine months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates have said that they probably wouldn't want to give you a third term. So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about that. Do you want another term you've had on the Fed? What's your stance on that? I don't have a stance on that. It's not something I'm focused on. Focused on doing our jobs. This year is going to be a highly consequential year for the Fed and for monetary policy, and we're all of us very buckled down focused on doing our jobs. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Johnberger with Yahoo Finance. As you mentioned, Core PCE has been running at 1.9% over the past six months, and you guys are actually expecting Core inflation higher this year at 2.4% compared to that six month measure. Given that forecast and that the median is for three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it's been over the last six months for the next six months? So we're going to do, we'll update our inflation forecast at the next meeting. You refer to the December meeting that's three months old, so it might be lower now given the data we've gotten. So look, as I mentioned, we're going to be racking to the data. If we get very strong inflation data and it kicks back up, then it will go slower or later or both. If we got really good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the, that would tell us that we could go sooner and perhaps go faster. So we're just going to be, but of course we'll weigh that with all the other factors. We're setting policy based on the totality of the data. But just to follow, if inflation stays where it is currently, that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive, would that mean you'd have to trim more perhaps than you already have factored in? Well, I think if we came to the view that if the six month inflation numbers, which are very close to two, were in PCE world, if we came to the, if we thought that is really where we're going to be, then yes, our policy would be in a different place. But that's the whole point is we're trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2% or toward 2%. Hi, Chepp. Daniela, this is Ajahn's phone. I just wondered if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data. It seems to suggest that consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy. I just wonder, is it fair to say that they're moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in recent months? And do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has played a role in that? And what challenges do you see going forward? Thank you. Yes, so it's been interesting that confidence surveys have been weak at a time when unemployment has been low, very low, historically low for a couple of years. But nonetheless, that's been the case. And we've asked ourselves why that is. And one obvious answer, we don't pretend to have perfect wisdom on this, is that one obvious answer is that the price level is high. So prices went up much more than 2% per year for a couple of years. And people are going to the store and they're paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago, three years ago. And they're not happy about it. And it's fine that inflation's coming down, but the prices are paying are still high. So that is what that has to be some part of why people are unhappy. And they're right to be unhappy. This is why we need to keep price stability. It's why we need to do our jobs, so that people don't have to deal with things like this. In terms of it, you're right. In recent surveys, you've seen a couple of significant increases in consumer confidence or happiness with the economy. I guess that's a good thing. That can support spending, can support economic activity. There's some evidence of that. But you're right, it is the fact that we have seen a meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they've been at various times, but they certainly have come up. Thank you for taking our questions, Brian Manistino in business. So committee members have said they like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data subject to a large revision, the issue with seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So did any members say they learned anything, not you reflected in the data, or have you yourself, or anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn't been captured in the data yet? Well, yes, I'm a big believer that yes. So we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy, and I always feel like you, I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies, individual companies, individual management teams, and then building out from that. And so starting with GDP data is, and working into what's actually affecting people's lives is challenging. It's very hard. So I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 reserve banks have really the best network of anyone, that in all their districts, they're talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back, that's what goes into the beige book. But that they come back in what each reserve bank president does is during the outlook go around, they'll say in my district, and they'll talk about 100 conversations, they won't talk up. They will give you input based on 100 conversations that they've had with people of all different walks. And I personally find it very helpful in understanding what's going on. And also I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. Did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they've heard from like their district? Yes, I mean, if you look back, the last, not this beige book, but the one before, it was more, it was a lot of slower activity. I think that what you're hearing now is things are picking up a bit. You're hearing not in every district and not every person that we talk to, but you're overall, it feels like you're hearing things picking up at the margin. So that's what comes through. Thank you, Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all together. You talked about basically the economy looking strong with 3.3% annualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might that you're in a position, in other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong and you're more tilted towards that. And also perhaps are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point? I'm not so worried about that. It's, again, we've had inflation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in unemployment. And there's no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process if it's going to continue. So I am, you know, I think declining inflation, continued declines in inflation are really the main thing we're looking at. Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong too. We don't have a growth mandate. We've got a maximum employment mandate and a price stability mandate. And those are the two things we look at. Growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two mandates.

2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:40:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the past two years. The labor market has come into better balance with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7% to 2.7%, but is still too high. We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3% in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases, which excludes inventory investment, government spending and net exports, and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand, grew at 2.8% in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023. Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year's robust pace, but remains solid. And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its enemic pace last year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year's pace with a median projection of 2.1% this year and 2.0% over the next two years. In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance. Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong, but a bit below that seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate ticked up, but remains low at 4%. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration. Non-always growth has eased over the past year and the jobs to workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated. FOMC participants expect labor market strength to continue. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0% at the end of this year and 4.2% at the end of next year. Inflation is eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.7% over the 12 months ending in April, excluding the volatile food and energy categories. Core PCE prices rose 2.8%. The consumer price index which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE price index rose 3.3% over the 12 months ending in May and the core CPI rose 3.4%. Inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected though more recently readings have eased somewhat. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6% this year, 2.3% next year and 2.0% in 2026. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals the committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue reducing our securities holdings. As labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain however and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. So far this year, the day had not given us that greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings have been more favorable in earlier in the year however and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective. We will need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress that we have seen on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. In our SCP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. With the economy evolves as expected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1% at the end of this year, 4.1% at the end of 2025, and 3.1% at the end of 2026. With these projections are not a committee plan or any kind of a decision, as the economy evolves, assessments of the appropriate policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum employment and price stability goals. As the economy remains solid, an inflation persists will prepare to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we're prepared to respond. Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate. We'll continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy, maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Just wondering if you could walk me through the committee's average inflation forecast. Core PCE is now forecast to be 2.8% by the year end. It's already 2.75 and after today's number there were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month. Does that tell you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation and in fact that it's going to get worse? And if you have this wrong, doesn't it mean that you sort of, you could have wrong the outlook for rates there? Yeah, so what's going on there is that we had very low readings in the second half last year, June through December really. And we're now lapping those. So as you go through the 12 month window, a very low reading drops out and a new reading comes in, the new reading gets added to the 12 month window. So it's just a slight element of conservatism that we're assuming a certain level of incoming monthly PCE and core PCE numbers. We're assuming a good but not great numbers. And if you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12 month reading. Now do we have high confidence that that's right? No, it's just a kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today's reading, then of course that wouldn't be the case. So it's just a forecasting device. I think let me say that we welcome today's reading and then hope for more like that. But if it comes in just to follow up, it comes in the way you forecast it. It would seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE. Thank you. Yeah, no, I mean, I think we've",0.0004975216053363,0.0026030609042407,151,2024-06-12,False,False,False,False,-0.0016220002211818,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 1, 2024

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with new economic projections from the U.S. central bank’s policy-makers likely to show fewer rate cuts this year and a delayed start to monetary policy easing..Fed officials will receive a new round of inflation data that could shape their outlook just hours before they conclude their latest two-day meeting and release a fresh policy statement and updated quarterly projections..But with the Fed’s efforts to lower inflation to its 2 per cent target showing only modest improvement this year through April and strong job growth allaying concerns of a weakening economy, analysts expect the central bank to maintain its “no-rush” attitude towards rate cuts, leaving the benchmark policy rate in the 5.25 per cent-5.50 per cent range that was set last July..“Given that inflation remains above target and activity remains robust, the Fed can exercise patience in determining when it would next adjust its policy rate,” Bank of America economists wrote about a meeting they felt would see little change to the central bank’s policy statement or in the guidance Fed Chair Jerome Powell offers in his post-meeting news conference..The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed’s target..In their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest..The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated..Washington CNN —
 The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated..Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was “certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.” But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs..Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that inflation is headed toward 2% — and the economy’s resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold..Fed officials’ latest policy statement noted that inflation has seen some “modest further progress” toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a “lack” of any improvements..Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest decision on interest rates..Powell calls May inflation data ‘encouraging’
 Not only was the Fed chief pleased with Wednesday’s inflation report, saying it was a “good reading,” but he maintained his view that interest rates are “restrictive” enough to rein in price hikes..If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn’t sound concerned at all..“The Fed is banking it can wait a few more months until inflation falls further.”
 The US economy remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace..The Fed is not expected to make any change to interest rates at its policy meeting..Fed officials on Wednesday will also release fresh forecasts for inflation, the economy and unemployment.",0.668,"{

2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:40:00,2024-06-12 18:50:00," What we said is that we don't think it will be appropriate to reduce rates and begin to lose in policy until we have more confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2% on a sustainable basis. And that's the test we've applied. I don't know that this rules that in or out. I mean, really, it's a forecast, a fairly conservative forecast month by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12 months rates by the end of the year. If we get, you know, good, better ratings in that, then you will see that come down or remain the same. If you're at 2.6, 2.7, you know, that's a really good place to be. Nick. Nick, Timer, also the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, if I look at the rate projections, I see 15, the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cuts this year, fairly evenly split between the two. And so I wonder if you could explain a little bit more the nuances of the differences there. Would two or three more inflation readings, like the one that we saw this morning, make a September interest rate cut possible? So as far as the SAP part of that is concerned, as you know, I talk to all of the other participants on the FMC every cycle. We talk about their summer of economic projections and the dot plot and everything. And what I hear and see is that people are looking at a range of plausible outcomes. And in many cases, they're thinking, I can't really distinguish between two of these. They're so close for me. These are very close calls. But we ask them to write down the most likely one. So they do. And I think you've, as you've said, there's 15 of the 19 are kind of clustered around one or two. So I think I would look at all of them as plausible. But I look at, so I think that does tell you kind of what the committee thinks. But what everyone agrees on is it's going to be data dependent. No one brings to this or takes away from it. That is on the committee a really strong commitment to a particular rate path. It's actually just their forecast and it's a combination of their forecast and their own reaction function. But again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent and I don't hold it with high confidence. And I think if you're looking for end and don't really think that they're not trying to send a strong signal that this is what I think is the right thing. It's just what they think at a given moment in time, subject to data. In terms of future meetings, we don't try to, we don't make decisions about future meetings until we get there. I think in terms of what we need to see, I mentioned it earlier. We want to gain further confidence. Certainly more good inflation readings will help with that. I'm not going to be specific about how many because really it's going to be not just the inflation reading readings. It's going to be the totality of the data. What's happening in the labor market? What's happening with the balance of risks? What's happening with the forecast? What's happening with growth? You look at all of that and you ask, are we confident? Have we reached an appropriate level of confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent? Or alternatively, do we see really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response, which is another thing that could happen? But again, we don't see that. We do see today's report as progress and as building confidence. But we don't see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant beginning to loosen policy at this time. And if I could quickly follow up, did you or any of your colleagues change your interest rate projections after 830 or whenever you got the inflation numbers today? So this happens too often, but it does happen. It just is, you know, data came. I think it happened a couple of meetings ago, a few meetings ago. So when that happens, when there's an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day, what we do is we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update, we tell them how to do that. And some people do, some people don't. Most people don't. But I'm not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that. So what's in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can reflect it in one day. I think we'll see PPI tomorrow. We'll know more about the PCE reading as the month goes on. But the initial CPI reading and it's kind of first level translation to PCE. We did have this morning. We were briefed about it and people were able to consider whether they should make changes. And as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don't. Hi, Chair Powell, Janelle Marche from Bloomberg. As you noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic. I wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that. So do you think that there still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2% or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates that many of those imbalances have eased? Sure. So by so many measures, the labor market was kind of overheated two years ago. And we've seen it gradually move back into much better balance between supply and demand. So what have we seen? We've seen labor force supply come up quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation. That's ongoing, mostly now through the immigration channel, but still we've had some increases in prime age labor force. In terms of on the demand side, you know, we've seen, well, we've seen quits moving down. We've seen job openings moving down. We've seen wage increases moving from very, very high levels a couple of years ago, back down to more sustainable levels. We have seen unemployment creep up now six tenths over the course of a year or so, very, very gradually. So we put all that together, which you have is still low unemployment, still 4% unemployment historically low. But it's moved up a little bit. It's softened a bit. And that's an important statistic. But more than that, you've got strong job creation. You have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though there's an argument that they may be a bit overstated, but still they're still there strong. So that's what we see. We watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole, but the labor market very carefully. And that's what we see. We see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward better balance. We're monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don't see that. As a quick follow up, the surveys that make up the job support are showing different sales. There's been some divergence, especially. We saw in the last report that we got on Friday. So how do you interpret that and how does it change your view on the labor market? So sometimes you can't reconcile the differences. You just have to look at it and try to understand. And that's why it always makes sense to look at a series in three, six, and 12 months of things rather than just one report. But you're right to point to the last report where there was your job losses in a household survey, big job gains in the establishment survey. So we're left with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data. Nonetheless, the overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling, gradually rebalancing labor market. Job openings while they've come way down are still greater than the number of unemployed people. The job's worker's gap is still a significantly positive number greater than it was before the pandemic. Overall, we're looking at what is still a very strong labor market, but not the superheated labor market of two years ago, or even one year ago. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Back on the rates path, the SEP showed quite large shift of rate cut expectations relative to March. That's a period in which the economic data flow hasn't been that dramatic a shift. How can you provide some color on what changed attitudes on the committee of the last three months to see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year? Yeah, the big thing that changed was the inflation forecast. So the inflation forecast moved up several tents for the end of the year. And as I mentioned earlier in the, you know, what did we take away from this? We had really, really good inflation data in the second half of last year than kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter. And what we took away from that was that it's probably going to take longer to get the confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy. So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might take place in, might have taken place this year, take place next year. You know, we, we, there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there's one more next year. So, so you really, if you look at year and 2025 and 26, you're almost exactly where you would have been just it just it's moved later because of that progress. Now you get another, you get data, different data today. So we'll have to see where the data light the way, you know, we're, we're at the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions. And today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected. And we'll just have to see what, what, what the incoming data flow means brings and, and how that affects the outlook and the balance of risks.

2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 18:50:00,2024-06-12 19:00:00," Thank you. Gina's my life in New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. In the summary of economic projections, the long run interest rate forecast moved up a bit. I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not as restrictive as we previously expected. How should we interpret what that means about how the committee views its current policy setting? So two things about that. One is this. You're right. It did move up. But I want to remember to point out that long run neutral rate of interest is a long run concept. It really is a theoretical concept can't be directly observed. And what it is is the interest rate they would hold the economy at equilibrium, maximum employment and price stability, potentially years in the future where there are no shocks. So it's a little bit. It's not something we observe today. Today, we've got a very specific economy with all kinds of shocks. We're still getting over from the pandemic. So I don't think that the concept of our starts very important concept in economics and in what we do. But honestly, it doesn't really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is in the near term. But back to your original question, people have been gradually writing it up because I just think people are coming to the view that rates aren't going to are less likely to go down to their pre-pandemic levels, which were very low by recent history measures. Now we can't really know that. That's an interesting dispute and discussion to have now. But ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer run slow moving forces. And there's a really good question about whether those really have changed or whether instead rates in the economy are experiencing a series of persistent but ultimately temporary shocks. That's been the debate. And we can't know. But in the meantime, we're making policy with the economy that we have, with the distortions that we have. And I also, to your other point, I think it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of how restrictive is policy has become one that everyone's asking. And we're asking it too. And my answer has been that policy is restrictive, the question of whether it's sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we know over time. But I think for the reasons I talked about the last press conference and other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear that policy is restrictive and is having the effects that we would hope for. Well, thanks, your panel. Howard Stein with Reuters. Just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion? I think the combination of tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to market on the level of restrictiveness that you need that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren't quite there yet. I'd be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion. I think this is about looking at the incoming data and asking how much progress are we making on inflation and how is the rest of the economy doing? Is the labor market still strong? That's what we're thinking about. You can translate it into the language you're talking about. But to me, the focus is more on we have a goal which is price stability and another goal which is maximum employment. How are we doing there? We think we've got a good strong labor market still. We think we've been making progress toward the price stability goal. And then for a while there was a pause and we look at today's thing and we think, well, that's a good reading and we hope we get more like that. And in the meantime, we're asking you, is our policy stance about right? And I think we think, yes, it's about right. We're prepared to adjust it as appropriate, but we think we're getting the things that we would want to get broadly speaking. And that's why we've been into this policy right now for almost a year. So just to follow up on that, I think what curious thing here is you've got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the major things for all of this year. You've got growth that stays above long run potential throughout the forecast period. Unemployment that never goes above the long run estimate of 4.2. So this isn't a story of slack improving inflation. So where's the improvement in inflation coming from that it's going to pick up pace so much in 2025? Well, it's been coming, where's it been coming from? I'll start with that. Clearly, some of what we've been getting is just the reversal of the unwinding of the pandemic related distortions to both supply and demand. And that is complemented by an amplified, supported by restrictive monetary policy. So those two things have been working together. We've also had a very positive supply shock on the labor side. And also you get a positive supply shock when the supply conditions unwind and return to normal. And above trend potential growth and high growth, and yet you've had the benefit of inflation coming down, really fast actually last year. And you will see what the rest of this year brings. So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue. Ultimately, the question is ultimately, are you down to demand? And we don't know that though. We're looking at today's report. If we see more like that, we can't know what the future holds. But in the meantime, we've made pretty good progress on inflation with our current stance. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The base case of the committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year. But your growth forecast doesn't see any slow down in the rest of the year. Nor does the unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market. And your inflation forecast basically average out to no change. So if at the end of the year there is no change from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates? What would be the point for a rate cut? We think policy is restrictive. And we think ultimately that if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real weakening in the economy. So that's always been the thought is that since we raise rates this far, we've always been pointing to cuts at a certain point. Not to eliminate the possibility of hikes, but no one has that as their base case. So no one on the committee does. But so that's how we think about it. And that's what we've been getting. That's what we've been getting is good progress on inflation with growth at a good level. And with a strong labor market. Now, ultimately we think rates will have to come down to continue to support that. But so far they haven't had to. And that's why we're watching so carefully for signs of weakness. We don't really see that. We kind of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand, gradual rebalancing in the labor market while we're continuing to make progress on inflation. So we're getting good results here. So to follow up, is there any kind of concern for the housing industry or financial stability banks in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point? On housing, you know, the housing situation is a complicated one. And you can see that's a place where rates are really having a significant effect. I mean, ultimately the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize. There will still be a national housing shortage as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one. But the distortions that we see now with lock-ins and things like that, you know, low mortgages. In terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well-capitalized, lending. You know, we've seen good performance by the banks. We had the turmoil early at last year, but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their liquidity, bringing up their capital and having risk management plans in place. So the banking system, you know, seems to be, seems to be in good shape. Chris. Thanks. Chris Regaver at Associated Press. I was wondering if we can read on inflation. If you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy, you mentioned labor markets coming into better balance and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. You're seeing, you know, anecdotal stories of the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts, McDonald's announcing a $5 meal deal. So, you know, people may still be unhappy about prices at the grocery store. It doesn't seem like there's a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy. And wonder if you could tell us more about it. It's true that inflationary pressures have come down, but we still have, we're still getting high inflation reading. So, you know, and I think you can see it in various places in, you know, in some parts of non-housing services, you see elevated inflation still. And that's probably to do with, it could be to do with wages. Goods prices have kind of fluctuated. There's been a surprising increase in import prices on goods, which is kind of hard to understand. And, you know, mate may, we've taken some signal from that. But, you know, and of course, housing services, you're seeing, you're continuing to see high readings there to some extent that's, you know, catch up inflation from earlier pressures.",0.0014675884475867,0.002864111755793,153,2024-06-12,True,False,False,False,-0.0016220002211818,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 1, 2024

2024-06-12 18:30:00,2024-06-12 19:00:00,2024-06-12 19:10:00," Right, inflationary pressures have come down. As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance. Wages are still running, you know, I would say above a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and trend productivity. You're still seeing wage increases moving above that. We haven't thought of wages as being the principal cause of inflation, but at the same time getting back to 2% inflation is likely to require return to a more sustainable level, which is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking your questions. There's obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected this year, but can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do to the economy, what you think would be a meaningful difference if there was a cut by the end of the year or even two? I think if you look back in five or ten years and try to pull out the significance to the U.S. economy of 125-based point rate cut, you'd have quite a job on your hands. So that's not how we look at it. Really, the whole rate path matters, and I do continue to think that when we do start to loosen policy, that will show up in a significant loosening in financial market conditions, and the market will price in what it prices in. I have no way of saying we're not at that stage, so I don't know what we'll be thinking about at that time. But it's a consequential decision for the economy, and you want to get it right. And fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we have the ability to approach this question carefully, and we will approach it carefully. While we're very much keeping an eye on downside economic risks, should they emerge? And you've been talking about this clear sense that it's just going to take longer to have the confidence that's needed for rate cuts. Is there something about what happened in the first couple months of the year that you're seeing differently now with more time or hindsight? Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year? You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the parts of inflation that we don't like and just make it go away. So, but we had a quarter where inflation was running higher, and yes, I could stand here and say it's stuff we shouldn't have taken signal from, but it is what it is. You know, you have to, you know, low inflation is low inflation high. So if you have a quarter where it's higher, we tried not to take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month and we said, okay, the signal we're taking is that, you know, we think it's going to take longer to get confidence that inflation is moving sustainably on 2%. That's what we said. I think that was the right thing to do. I still think that's the right thing to do. Now we have today's inflation reading, which is very different, very much more positive. We're going to have to see what the trend is, what's going to be the data going forward. We're looking for something that gives us confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And readings like today, you know, that's a step in the right direction, but you know, one reading isn't, it's just, it's the only one reading you don't want to be too motivated by any single data point. Certainly. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I'm Jo Ling-Kan with CBS News. What's your message to Americans who are seeing, encouraging economic data, but don't feel good about this economy? I, you know, I don't think anyone knows, has a definitive answer why people are not as happy about the economy as they might be. We don't tell people how they should think or feel about the economy. That's not our job. You know, people experience what they experience. All I can tell you is what the data show, which is we've got an economy that's growing at a solid pace. We've got a very strong labor market with unemployment at 4%. It's been a long time since we've had, you know, a long stretch of time with unemployment at or below 4%. Very long time. We had a period of high inflation. Even that inflation has come down really significantly and we're doing everything we can to, you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability, we're confident that we'll get there. And in the meantime, you know, it's going to be painful for people, but the ultimate pain would be a period of long, a long period of high inflation. It is people who lower income, people people who put the margins of the economy who have the worst experience, who experience the most pain from inflation. So, you know, it's for those people for all Americans, but particularly for those people that we're doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control. That's just a quick follow up here. You've indicated one interest rate cut sometime this year. And I know you don't have a crystal ball up there, but a lot of people are watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive. For everybody who's out there waiting on a rate cut about when can consumers expect some relief? Well, you know, I don't have a precise date for you, but what we said is that we want to make sure that we're confident that inflation is actually moving back down to 2%. And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy. So having that kind of confidence, the inflation will be at 2%. It just pays benefits to the whole economy to all Americans for a long period of time. We had that period for a very long time. We very much want to get back to a place where people can not think about inflation. It's just not a concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make. We were there for a long time, and our goal is to get back to that place. And we've made good progress. And we're just, we're in the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done. Claire Jones, financial times. Just drawing on the change and the statement on the being more disfur the progress on inflation. You know, halfway through the year and after today's CPI release, you know, what have you and other committee members found that has been particularly encouraging to you? And just in terms of the conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular? Thank you. So encouraging has been that growth, you know, the growth clearly that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see still strong growth, solid growth this year. That's been very encouraging. If you go back a year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and recession. Many forecasters had that. And that's not what happened. Instead we got the U.S. anyway, and it's in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the world. So that's been encouraging. I would say that today's inflation report is encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging. You ask about, your second question was really about shelter inflation. So I think if you go back a couple of years, we know that there were renters and then there are people who own their houses and we have OER, which is, there's equivalent rent. And so when market-based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the, when the economy reopened, they really went up sharply. Those play into role-over rents much more slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants. And so what we found now that there are big lags. So there's sort of a, there's a bulge of high past increases in market rents that has to get worked off and that may take several years. Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain going up at relatively low levels and they still are, you know, this is just going to happen and just going to happen more slowly than we thought. We also do sort of this thing where we impute rental value to owned homes. And that's, you know, many countries around the world do that. Some do it differently than us. It's something that the, you know, that the price experts have regularly looked at. It is not something that we're the only country that does. And it's not something we're looking at changing or we'd look at changing, you know, anytime soon. But it's true. It's one of the very hardest things in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services that someone is getting by living at home that they could rent, but they're actually living in it. And some countries use to just ignore that, but that's not our, that's not how we do inflation here. We do it the way we do it and we've been very transparent about it. And, you know, it's true that we're seeing delays in realizing what's happening economically. But we understand that. And we understand that very well. Edward. Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business. Thank you for taking the question, Chair Files. So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer. The last jobs report showed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs. That's up 8.2 percent. And since January of 2021, we've seen prices rise 19 percent. So people are using their credit cards to pay for their lifestyle. What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending? So you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more. You know, we're seeing is basically spending was going up faster than disposable income during big parts of next year.",0.0009308755760368,0.0016223590575568,154,2024-06-12,False,False,False,False,-0.0016220002211818,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 1, 2024

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with new economic projections from the U.S. central bank’s policy-makers likely to show fewer rate cuts this year and a delayed start to monetary policy easing..But with the Fed’s efforts to lower inflation to its 2 per cent target showing only modest improvement this year through April and strong job growth allaying concerns of a weakening economy, analysts expect the central bank to maintain its “no-rush” attitude towards rate cuts, leaving the benchmark policy rate in the 5.25 per cent-5.50 per cent range that was set last July..“Given that inflation remains above target and activity remains robust, the Fed can exercise patience in determining when it would next adjust its policy rate,” Bank of America economists wrote about a meeting they felt would see little change to the central bank’s policy statement or in the guidance Fed Chair Jerome Powell offers in his post-meeting news conference..Given the current stalled progress on inflation, many analysts expect the Fed’s “dot plot” projection for its benchmark policy rate to show only two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year, versus the three anticipated as of March – if only to account for the lapse of time..“If there is any risk … it’s that there will be only one 25-basis-point rate cut this year,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, with Powell using his news conference to “manage expectations” at a point where Fed policy-makers feel particularly uncertain about the path the economy may follow..Powell and other policy-makers have minimized the risk of a further rate increase..The current policy rate is regarded as restrictive enough to discourage investment and spending and gradually return inflation to the Fed’s target..Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level..In their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest..The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated..Officials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March..Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was “certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.” But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs..The Fed will begin cutting interest rates once it’s clear that inflation has cooled enough and won’t heat back up — or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that..Fed officials’ latest policy statement noted that inflation has seen some “modest further progress” toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a “lack” of any improvements..When asked what will help tug inflation closer to the Fed’s 2% target, Powell said slower inflation will come “from where it’s been coming from,” pointing to the “the unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.”
 “And that is complemented by, amplified by, supported by restrictive monetary policy, so those two things are working together,” he said..No concerns about the job market

And so what that you'd expect to see is people spending more on their credit cards that it that has been happening. Credit card balances have been going up. Credit card defaults have been going up. They're not at high levels. We remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up. They couldn't spend money. They couldn't go out to spend money. They could spend money from home. But households were in very, very strong, historically strong financial shape. They've now worked off a lot of that. So we're watching that carefully. And what do we see? That's what we see. We see the same data that everybody else sees. But you still got household sector that's in pretty good shape. But nonetheless, it's not in the kind of shape it was in a year or two ago. And we're carefully watching that. So how close then are we to that point where the consumer can't continue to spend as a spending or companies can't hire? Like they're hiring. Consumer spending is still growing. It's not growing at the pace it was growing at a year or so ago. But it's still growing solidly. And by the way, other parts of the economy are picking up spending on equipment and intangibles has picked up quite a bit in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech plants. So overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth and something around 2%, which is a good pace of growth for the U.S. economy. Now, you're right, though. We do see the same thing other people see, which is increasing financial pressures on more lower income people. And the best thing we can do is to foster a very strong jobs economy, which we think we have done ultimately to get inflation under control because those people experience inflation very directly, very painfully. And once we get inflation under control, rates can come down, which will also improve. Thanks. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we know with Politico. You've mentioned that unexpected weakening in the labor market would bring rate cuts sooner. And I was just wondering, can you talk a little bit about what that would look like? Is it more of a quicker pace of people losing jobs? Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to start to go above 4.2 or something like that? How are you thinking about what you're looking for to see the job market unexpectedly weakened? When I say unexpectedly, the first thing is more than kind of is in our forecast or in common forecast. So something more than that. But we'll be looking at everything. The labor market has the ability, has the tendency sometimes to move to weaken quickly. So waiting for that to happen is not what we're doing. We're watching very carefully. We're looking at the balance of risks. I always point out the balance of risks. And also the fact that we look at all of the whole situation. So a decision to begin to lose in policy could have several reasons associated with it at a given time. But we monitor all the labor market data. And if we saw troubling weakening more than expected, then that would be something we'd consider responding to. But we look at the broader context of what's going on too. So something like negative payroll numbers would be? I'm not going to, I mean, I can think of things that would, many things would make it on that list. But I don't think I'll butter them here. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon, you're in a bit of a different image with the economist. May I ask you mentioned with the slightly higher PC readings earlier this year that it wasn't one or two months, but three months that tipped you to be a bit more cautious in the rate outlook. Should we take from that that, you know, it looks like May will be quite good for PC as it was for CPI. Does that imply that kind of two more good months would reensteal the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently project? You know, I don't actually have that kind of mechanical thing in my thinking. I get that, you know, as many good ones as we had bad ones. But it's not like that. It's the whole, it's going to be the totality of the data. Labor market data, the growth data, in terms of inflation, you know, you'd want to see real progress that builds your confidence that we are a path down to 2%. And I don't want to try to give you specific numbers of things in that because that points to your dates. And I just don't think we're not at a point of being able to do that. Thank you for doing this. I'm Kostya Takami with Nikesh. I would like to know about the impact of stronger dollar on US economic growth and prices. And I have no doubt that the market should determine the exchange rate. But Japan and some emerging market are suffering from strong dollar. So I want to know if it is having a positive impact on US economy in total. Thank you. So we don't actually, it's our finance ministry, the Treasury Department that has a responsibility for thinking about and if it sees fit doing things about the level of the dollar. So for us, it's just another financial variable. And you write the dollar has exhibited some strength over the course of the last year or so because the US economy is very strong. We don't think of it as benefiting or hurting the US. We don't, again, we don't manage the level of the dollar. That's not our job. It's not, you know, for our economy, what, you know, what we're trying to foster is maximum employment and price stability. And we feel like we've made good progress on both of those goals over the course of the past year. Jennifer. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair. Paula Jennifer Chanberger with Yahoo Finance. You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2%. Your forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8% on core PCE or at 2.8% of course on core PCE. Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got 2.6 to 2.7 on PCE, that would be a good place to be. You also indicated the job market has mostly normalized. So why not cut rates this summer just once? You're well above neutral to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long and the quest for confidence for inflation. You know, so we are well aware of the two-sided risks here. Let me just say we, we, we, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of economic activity, of employment, of the expansion. We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we've done and have to then start over and it could be very disruptive. So we're, we're, we're extremely aware of both, both of those risks and, and just basically trying to manage them. And what we said is that we're, we don't think it'll be appropriate to begin to loosen policy until we're more confident that inflation is moving down to 2% over time on a sustainable basis. That's, that's kind of been our test. Or there's another test which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market conditions. So I think that's, that's the right way for us to think about it. We, that's our, that's our dual mandate there. And, you know, we, we have a strong economy. We've got growth, all forecasts are very commonly around 2%. That's a, that's a, that's a strong growth rate for our economy. The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate and employment still low. So we have the ability now to approach this question carefully and that, that's what we're doing. Just to follow, Chair Powell, do you need to be ahead of a weakening in the labor market? Otherwise is it too late given that the labor market is a lagging indicator, right? When you look at the monthly jobs data? We completely understand that that's the risk and that's, that's not what we're, that's not our plan. It's to wait for things to break and then try to fix them. We're, we're trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework. And, we think we're doing that. Evan. Thank you, Chair Powell. Evan Reiser with Market News International. You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year. At this point, do you have any specific time frame for the start of that? Who will lead it? Will you be, will it be you or a member, a committee group of your, of your peers? What will be the parameters? Do you anticipate the review will consider changes, communications going forward? So we, what we've been thinking is that we would announce and commence the review later or late in the year. In the meantime, as that time approaches, we will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it. Within scope would certainly be communications generally. I'm not going to say that we'll look at this so that particular thing and all the other details, we're just, we don't want to get prematurely into a conversation until it's really time to have it. And so, you know, I'm going to leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year. Go ahead and Nancy, for the last question. Hi Chair Powell, Nancy Marshall, Gensers with Marketplace. Just one more question on housing. Can you still cut rates with shelter prices high?",0.0016115516018822,0.0021741934295136,155,2024-06-12,True,False,False,False,-0.0016220002211818,Negative,Positive,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT May 1, 2024

There isn't any one thing, one variable like housing prices, moderating that would really decide or decide against what we're doing. We've got an overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustainable basis. That's our overall test. Or alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the labor market. So those are two different tests. I would say, you know, we're not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying that's the one. We don't target housing prices, for example. And we don't target wages. We target aggregate prices and overall employment. But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow down the pace of rate cuts? I think you look at the over. We'll be looking at the aggregate numbers and asking ourselves what's going on here with inflation at the aggregate level. And of course, if any price that contributed to ongoing inflation would matter, any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter too.

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, with new economic projections from the U.S. central bank’s policy-makers likely to show fewer rate cuts this year and a delayed start to monetary policy easing..But with the Fed’s efforts to lower inflation to its 2 per cent target showing only modest improvement this year through April and strong job growth allaying concerns of a weakening economy, analysts expect the central bank to maintain its “no-rush” attitude towards rate cuts, leaving the benchmark policy rate in the 5.25 per cent-5.50 per cent range that was set last July..“Given that inflation remains above target and activity remains robust, the Fed can exercise patience in determining when it would next adjust its policy rate,” Bank of America economists wrote about a meeting they felt would see little change to the central bank’s policy statement or in the guidance Fed Chair Jerome Powell offers in his post-meeting news conference..Given the current stalled progress on inflation, many analysts expect the Fed’s “dot plot” projection for its benchmark policy rate to show only two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts by the end of this year, versus the three anticipated as of March – if only to account for the lapse of time..Just as they acknowledge risks that unemployment could rise fast and warrant rate cuts to support the economy, they see aspects of inflation, particularly in housing and the broad services sector, that may have stalled at too high a level..In their final comments before the latest policy meeting, a number of central bank officials, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, said they needed to see several more months of improving inflation data before deciding to cut rates, statements investors have construed as pushing back any rate reduction to the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 meeting at the earliest..Officials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March..The Fed will begin cutting interest rates once it’s clear that inflation has cooled enough and won’t heat back up — or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that..If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn’t sound concerned at all..Wall Street’s best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI..Instead, the focus will be on whether it keeps three rate cuts in its “dot plot” projections for this year..Federal Reserve officials are expected Wednesday to dial back their estimates of interest rate cuts in 2024 after digesting a fresh inflation reading..Investors are bracing for Federal Reserve officials this afternoon to dial back estimates of interest rate cuts in 2024..Before policymakers go public with those predictions, they get a fresh inflation reading from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that is expected to show continued moderation in May after an encouraging April..(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)
 Fed Chair Jay Powell has made clear that, before cutting rates, the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward the central bank's goal of 2%..For that to happen, today's inflation report and the two that follow in the coming months would likely need to show improvement for the central bank to pull the trigger..But if the Bank of Canada keeps cutting and the Fed holds on past the first quarter of next year, “then we could start to see significant divergence.”
