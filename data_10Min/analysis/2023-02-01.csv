2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:40:00," Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Over the past year we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. In addition we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Storing price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 1%. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Under-spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing the labor market continues to be out of balance. Their demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in December total PCE prices rose 5.0%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.4%. The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And while recent developments are encouraging we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to a returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal front's rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.5 to 4.3 quarters percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal front's rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. People take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step down from last year's rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, as we determine the extent of future increases that we required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by taking into account the totality of incoming data and the implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. And I look forward to your questions. Chris. Good game. Chris Rugeber to the Associated Press. Thank you for doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which is also brought down mortgage rates and the stock market posted a solid game in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder and could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in or to offset the easing of financial conditions? So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy or strength that we're putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2%. And of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we're not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things affect financial conditions, not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we said policy. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter, we've seen a deceleration in prices, in wages and a fall in consumer spending. All while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low, does this at all change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up at all to see inflation come down to the levels you're looking for? So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage. What you see is really in the good sector, you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services and shortages or have been abated. So you see that in the other, in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while, but then to come down assuming that new leases continue to be lower. So in those two sectors, you've got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called non-housing, core non-housing services where we don't see disinflation yet. But I would say that so far what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions. How's your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go change since December? You know, we're going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting and we'll see at that time.",0.005881190076109507,0.0122778675282713
2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:40:00,2023-02-01 19:50:00," that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting underway and we continue to get strong labor market data. So we'll update those forecasts in March. Neil. Hi Chair Powell, Neil or one of the axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December Jolt's morning job openings actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? So you're right about the data of course. We did see, we've seen our jar early earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number in Jolt's has been quite volatile recently and I did see that it moved up back up this morning. I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio I guess is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, nonetheless you're right. We do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market you still see very high payroll job creation and quits are still at an elevated level. So by many, many indicators the job market is still very strong. Colby and then how is it? Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the economic data since the December meeting is the trajectory for the Fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guide post for the policy path forward or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now. So you're right at the December meeting we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be and that's obviously back in December and the median for that was between five and five and a quarter percent. At the March meeting we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe on going rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to two percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground and financial additions of certainly tightened. I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we're writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to move rates up beyond what we said in December we would certainly do that. At the same time if the data come in in the other direction then we'll make data dependent decisions at coming meetings of course. Just as a quick follow up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in six or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage. Whereas we have no incentive in the desire to over tighten. But if we feel like we've gone too far we can certainly, because the concern and inflation is coming down faster than we expect then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that in this situation where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years the job is not fully done. As I mentioned, I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that is 56% of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it. It's not happening yet. Inflation in the core services X housing is still running at 4% on a 6 and 12 month basis. So there's nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing less than 50%, you actually I think now have a story that is credible that's coming together. Although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline. So for the third sector we don't see anything here. So I think it would be premature. We very premature to declare victory or to think that we've really got this. We need to see our goal of course is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector. And they should be coming into play to have inflation, the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But so far we don't see that. And I think until we do, we say ourselves it's having a lot of work left to do. Howard? Howard, tonight with Reuters and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation disease. As these, that's new. You've taken out references to the war and Ukraine is causing price increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher. Yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come. So I'm wondering why is that the case and does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact? So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that and we see it really in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. This is what we thought what happens at the very beginning and now here it is actually happening. And for the reasons we thought, it's supply change, it's shortages, and it's demand revolving back toward services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's around a quarter of the PCE price index, core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services. And that's driven by very different things. And as I mentioned with housing services, we expect and other forecasters expect that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months. But we'll then come down assuming that that new lease is continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that's sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the good sector. And we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. And this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down, this is good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen. We hope soon in the core goods X housing. Sorry, the core core services X housing sector that I talked about. And I don't see it yet. It's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them that are the same. And we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60% of that will be is research which show is sensitive to slack in the economy. And so the labor market will probably be important. Some of the other ones that's, the labor market's not going to be important. But many other factors will drive it any case. We don't see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think we need to see that. It's the majority of the core PC index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PC, which is our mandate. So it's not that we're not, we're neither optimistic or pessimistic. We're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet until we do. I think we, you know, we see ourselves, we got to be honest with ourselves. We see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent, we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to, we have to complete the job. I mean, that's, that's what we're here for. Nick Timmeros, the Wall Street Journal, a chirpal you observed several years ago that we learned we can have low unemployment rate without above target inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level, despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? So, you know, we've raised rates four and a half percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think because inflation is still running very hot. We're, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that. It really, the story we're telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I've just gone through a couple times. And again, we don't see it affecting the services sector X housing yet. But I mean, I think our assessment is that we're not very far from that level. We don't know that, though. We don't know that. So I think we're at the end of the day.",0.0050848706674201,0.0077685178356319
2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:50:00,2023-02-01 20:00:00," we're living in a world of significant uncertainty. I would look across the rate, the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive, right by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is restrictive. We're trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That's all. And that's why we're slowing down to 25 basis points. We're going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting this week? You'll see the minutes will come out in three weeks and we'll give you a lot of detail. I, you know, we spent a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn't want to start to drive and discard all the details there. But that was the sense of the discussion was really talking quite a bit about the path forward. Okay, Tori. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given that we've now hit up against it, I was wondering if the US goes past the X-Date. Will the Fed do whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent? Or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So your question is would we say your question again? Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? So you're really asking about, but you're asking about prioritization and effect. Is that what you're, okay? So I feel like I have to say this. There's only one way forward here. And that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be highly risky. And that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I'm just gonna leave it at that. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that that would happen? I'm just gonna leave it at that. This is a matter that's to be resolved between, really, it's really Congress's job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don't involve us. We're not involved in those discussions. So we're the fiscal agent. Gina and this speaker. Gina Smiley from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases and then restarting them? Lori Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to suggest that that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that views broadly shared on the committee. So the committee, obviously, did not see this as a time to pause. We judged that the appropriate thing to do with this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25. Basis points and we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2%. So that's the judgment that we made. You know, we're going to write down new forecasts in March and we'll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will. Sorry, I should have been clear. I mean, would it be possible to take a meeting off for example and then resume? Could you rather than just doing it every meeting, a move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves? I mean, I think this is not something that the committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle though, you know, we used to think we used to do is go every other meeting if you remember 25 basis points. And that was considered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and they left it that they're willing to raise rates after pausing, but this is not something that, this is not something that the federal open market committee is on the point of deciding right now. Steve Lee's been CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1%. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1%. And you've achieved this without going to your 5.1% funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year. And you've also achieved it without the 1% is point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I'm wondering if you've considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong. And it's possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without without the surge in unemployment. And specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Leal Brandard who said to recent that inputs other than wages may have been responsible for important price increases for some non-housing services, an unwinding of these factors. In other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Thanks. So a couple things. First, on the forecast, you're right, if you take very short-term three-month say measures of PCE, core PCE inflation, they're quite low right now. But that's because that's driven by, significantly negative readings from goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory. And that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer run trend of something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4% by the middle of the year, for example. So that's really where the sustainable level is, is more like at 4%. So that would suggest there's work left to do. Let's say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible, as I mentioned. Obviously our policies data dependent, we would take that into account. In terms of the core non-housing services, as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60% of that subsector, of that sector, are we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way. But some of the other sectors are not. And for example, financial services is a big sector. That's really not driven by labor markets, wages. So that's why I said, there are a number of things that will affect, take restaurants. So clearly labor is important for restaurants, but so are food prices. And transportation services is gonna be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall though, my own view would be that you're not going to have a sustainable return to 2% inflation in that sector, without a better balance in the labor market. And I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften. And so far, we've got, as I mentioned in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here, but I still think, I continue to think that there's a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment. And that's because the setting we're in is quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints. Not something that you really have seen in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought. And we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think a story will emerge on the non-housing services sector soon enough. But I think there is ongoing disinflation and we don't yet see, we can't see in the labor market. So we'll have to see. Can we get there with a 5%? Certainly possible. Yeah, absolutely, it's possible. It's a question, no one really knows. I think it's because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways. It may well be that it will take more slowing than we expect than I expect to get inflation down to 2%. But I don't, that's not my base case. My base case is that the economy can return to 2% inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that's a possible outcome. Many, many forecasters would say it's not the most likely outcome, but I would say there's a chance of it. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio, I'd like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation. There's still a lot of talk about very, very slow",2.444330375691356e-05,0.0039069372298794
2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 20:00:00,2023-02-01 20:10:00," going forward in 2023 and the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I'm wondering if you have changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward. And whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place which calls for more restraint on your part. So I do think you most forecast and my own assessment would be that growth will continue, positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of GDP growth of 1% last year and also final sales growth which we think is a better indicator of about 1%. I think most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors though that need to be considered. You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit and that will matter for us potentially. The global market remains very, very strong and that's job creation, that's wages as inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also state and local governments are really flush these days with money and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support, they're also spending a lot, there's a lot of spending coming in a construction pipeline both private and public and so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year and that's my base case is that there will be positive growth this year. Rich? Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg, first of all how are you doing? Fine, thanks. Good. Second of all, I think it's early on in the post conference you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you think? You mentioned three months, we've seen three months in a row of governor Walder suggested he might want to see six months. Is it just the inflation data or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that substantially more evidence? So I don't think there's a, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating accumulation of evidence. So of course we'll be looking by the time of the March meeting we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will and we'll be asking ourselves what are they telling us and soon after that we'll have another ECI wage report which as you know is a report that we we like because it is just for composition and it's very complete. And you know the one we got I guess it was yesterday was was constructive it's you know it shows wages coming down but still at a high level there's still at a level that's way above where well above where they were before the before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months but as the accumulated evidence comes in it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say though we you know it is our job to restore price stability and achieve two percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. Market participants have a very different job and it's a fine job it's a great job I'm Victor I did that job for for years but in one form or another but you know we have to deliver that and so we are strongly resolved that we will you know complete this task because we think it has benefits that will you know support economic activity and benefit the public for for many many years. Thank you so thank you for taking the questions so you've talked about we had solid job growth I'm ever Lawrence from Fox Business by the way we had solid job growth slight falling in the increase in consumer spending it seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to from a 9.1% CPI inflation to 6.5% CPI inflation is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2. I don't think we know honestly you know the so we of course expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021 and it didn't it didn't come down all through 22 and now it's coming down it's come down pretty fast. So I would say these are this is not a standard business cycle you can look at the last 10 times there was a global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did it it's just it's unique so I think certainty is just not appropriate here inflation it's just harder to forecast inflation it may come down faster it may take longer to come down and you know our job is to deliver inflation back to target and we will do that but I think we we're going to be cautious about about declaring victory and you know sending signals that that we think that the game is one because it you know it's we've got a long way to go it's just it's the early stages of disinflation and it's most welcome to be able to say that that we are now in disinflation but that's great but we we just see that it has to spread through the economy and it's going to take some time that's all. How long do you see them the federal fund rate remaining at this elevated level you know so are again the my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SCP and I mean there are many different forecasts but generally it's a forecast of slower growth some softening in labor market conditions and inflation moving down moving down steadily but not quickly and in that case if if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year. To loosen policy this year of course other people have forecast with with inflation coming down much faster that's a different thing you know if that happens inflation comes down much faster you know then we'll be seeing that and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy. Simon. Thank you chair Powell Simon to win a speech with the economist I may ask a further question about the language around ongoing increases that of course implies at least two further rate rises. If you look at Fed fund features pricing the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause are you concerned about that divergence or do you think of everything breaks right is that is out of plausible outcome. I'm not I'm not particularly concerned about about the divergence note because it's it is largely due to the markets expectation that inflation will move down more quickly I think that's that's the the bigger part of that. So again as I just mentioned we you know our forecast there different participants have different forecast but generally those forecast over for continued. Subdued growth some softening the labor market but not a recession not a recession and and we have inflation moving down. You know into the somewhere in the mid threes or maybe lower than that this year will update that in March but that's what we thought in December markets are past that they they show inflation coming down in some cases much quicker than that so we'll just have to see and we have a different view and a different view to different forecast really. And given our outlook I just I don't see us cutting rates this year if we get our have our outlook turns true as I mentioned just now if we do see inflation coming down much more quickly that'll that'll play into our policy saying of course. Stop. Hi, Jeff out Scott horse they're from PR one of the changes in the statement this this month is that the committee is no longer listening public health as a month of data points you'll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that as the federal reserve no longer see the pandemic as as weighing on the economy. That's the general sense of it look we understand I personally understand well that that that covid is still out there. But it that it's no longer playing an important role in our economy and you know we kept that statement in there for for quite a while and I think we just we knew we would take it out at some point there's never a perfect time but we thought that you know people are handling it better in the economy in the society or handling it better now it doesn't really need to be in it. You know in the feds monthly you know post meeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to you know a health issue. Nancy. Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Genser with marketplace wanted to go back to another thing that fed by share layup brainer to recently. She said she doesn't see signs of a wage price spiral and I'm wondering if you agree with that. I do yeah I do and I don't see that yet but the whole point is you know if you once you see it you're you have a serious problem that that that means that effectively in people's decision making inflation has become a really salient issue and once that happens that's which that's what we can't allow to happen and you know so that's why we worry that the longer we're at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long every day you know that the more",0.0061591475634194,0.0065504851758609

By the way, I think it's becoming less salient and people are, you know, we pick that up in conversations and I've seen some data too that show people are, you know, gradually, they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now and they're very, very low with 3.5 percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases, is nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. So that's what you're looking at most closely is consumer expectations. That's at the very hardest. Consumers in businesses that, you know, are essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are very, at a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That's a, that's a, sort of a bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be, we think it's important. And in this case, I would say the risk eight months ago or so, longer term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are, they seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it's, you know, and that's, I think that's very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided and the public has decided that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it's just a matter of us following through. That's measurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that'll be part of the process of getting it down and it's a very positive thing. Great. Thank you, Chair Powell, Greg Robb from Marker Watch. In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of senses that struck people as important. When the committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I haven't seen, heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members or is that still something you're concerned about? Thank you. I would put it this way. It's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place. As we've discussed a couple of times here, there's a different difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down. We're just going to have to see. I mean, I'm not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast. But our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we'll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we'll see. Good to bring in for the last question. Hi Chair Powell. Brendan Peterson with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer faster to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play an effect as we get closer to that drop-dead deadline this summer? I look at it's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two because I believe Congress will wind up acting and as it will and must in the end to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk the progress we're making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. We of course will monitor money market conditions carefully as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down and then it will grow back up and we understand there'll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that and we're watching it carefully. We'll just be monitoring it. Thank you very much.",-0.0021132918771861,0.005322395566298
