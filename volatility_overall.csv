,,,,,,,"This calculation involves finding the volatility measure ((high price - low price) / low price ) of every interval from t=0 which is 2:30pm ET (start time of the press conference) until the end of the press conference. Then, the standard deviation (square root of sum of squares) of the volatility price measures for each t from t=0 until the end of press conference (maximum t) across all intervals with the given combinations of interval price movement ((close price - open price)/open price) during interval) and statement price movement (((close price - open price)/open price) during statement release (2:00pm ET to 2:05pm ET)) is found - combinations are positive & positive, positive & negative, negative & positive, negative & negative"
