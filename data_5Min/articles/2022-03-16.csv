1,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global equities, U.S. yields rise on Ukraine peace hopes, Fed rate hike",2022-03-16T17:08:51Z,"Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday as investors expected the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates, and grew more hopeful for a breakthrough in ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukraine.","Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday as investors expected the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates, and grew more hopeful for a breakthrough in ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukraine. The Fed will likely end to its ultra-easy pandemic-era monetary policy with a rate rise of at least 25 basis points to fight surging inflation. Traders will also parse the tone of the Fed's policy statement and watch details of projected economic conditions. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit the highest in almost three years, hours before the Fed decision was expected. The yields were last at 2.1777%. During the session they reached 2.204%, the highest since May 2019. ""The quarter-point hike is already in the market, already known. What will have an effect on the market is what the Fed ends up saying after the announcement, whether they seem hawkish or dovish,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital in California. MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, gained 2.41%. European stocks rose, rebounding from a loss the previous session, with sentiment buoyed by positive comments from Ukrainian and Russian officials on prospects of an agreement to end the three-weeks old conflict. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 3.07%, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had closed 5.1% higher overnight. On Wall Street, the three main indexes were trading up ahead of the Fed's anticipated rate hike announcement, driven by stocks in the technology, financials and consumer discretionary sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2% to 33,946.4, the S&P 500 gained 1.64% to 4,332.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.57% to 13,281.65. ""At this point, I think you have a lot of active investors and hedge funds that are seeking any news that would make for a tradable bottom despite the dire global macro scenario of inflation, rising rates, and a horrible war in Russia-Ukraine,"" Schulman added.
Oil bounced all over the place in another volatile session as traders reacted to the peace talks and a surprising increase in U.S. inventories. Benchmark Brent crude had swung between $97.55 and $103.70 and was at $99.54 per barrel, down 0.37% in early afternoon trading. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.15% to $96.58. The U.S. dollar slid further from almost two-year highs reached over the past week, while Ukraine peace hopes pushed the euro higher. The dollar index fell 0.317%, with the euro up 0.47% to $1.1002. Safe-haven gold fell to more than a two-week low. Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $1,908.83 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 0.76% to $1,913.80 an ounce.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 1.6%, with base metal miners and banks leading the gains, while the domestically focused mid-cap index advanced 3.2%.
The Fed is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in three years later on Wednesday and give guidance on future tightening. ""Focus will be on Fed's inflation forecast for next year and 2024, as that will provide insights into whether it sees (inflation) on the back of Ukraine crisis as something short term or more structural,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.
Base metal miners jumped 2.9%, lifted by supply concerns and promises of more economic stimulus in top consumer China, while banks, which are likely to benefit in a higher interest environment, rose 3.4%. The sharp turnaround in Chinese markets also boosted financial stocks that do a lot of business in the region like Prudential and Standard Chartered, according to Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. With inflation rising to 40-year highs and data showing a drop in the UK unemployment rate below pre-pandemic levels, investors are widely expecting the Bank of England to lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday.
Among individual stocks, Avast fell 13.3% after Britain's anti-trust regulator launched an in-depth probe into U.S. cybersecurity firm NortonLifeLock Inc's $8.6 billion purchase of the company. Defense company BAE Systems fell 3.6% on hopes around the Russia-Ukraine peace talks, after rising nearly 28.4% so far this year.
IG Group shed 0.8% after the online trading platform forecast full-year revenue to ""moderately"" exceed expectations, as the Ukraine crisis increases market volatility, but it predicted slower growth on its U.S. platform.

3,Fed raises rates and projects six more increases in 2022.,2022-03-16T16:51:49Z,The Federal Reserve lifted its policy interest rate for the first time since 2018 and penciled in six more rate increases this year as it tries to combat a burst of quick price increases.,"The Federal Reserve lifted its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday as policymakers took their first decisive step toward trying to tame rapid inflation by cooling the economy.
The Fed had kept rates near zero since March 2020, and the decision marked its first increase since 2018. Policymakers also projected six more similarly sized increases over the course of 2022 as inflation comes in at a 40-year high, signaling that they are going to pull back support for the economy markedly.
“The economy no longer needs — or wants — these, this very highly accommodative stance,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during his post-meeting news conference.
The Fed is at an inflection point after two years of trying to help the economy to recover from the damage inflicted by the global pandemic. While the coronavirus continues to disrupt commerce around the world, the United States economy has staged a swift recovery. America’s job market has rebounded rapidly from steep pandemic job losses that had pushed unemployment to 14.7 percent, and businesses are now struggling to find workers.
A surge in consumer spending has helped to push the rate of inflation to levels not seen since the 1980s. Instead of echoing the anemic slog back from the 2007-9 recession — one that kept millions of applicants out of work and left inflation tepid despite years of rock-bottom rates — the pandemic bounce-back has been vigorous.
Judging by inflation, it may even have too much heat, which is why the Fed is trying to slow the economy down to a more sustainable pace.
“We’ve had price stability for a very long time, and maybe come to take it for granted — but now we see the pain,” Mr. Powell said. “We’re strongly committed, as a committee, to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched, and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels.”
Mr. Powell said the labor market and economy are so strong that the Fed thinks that both can handle higher interest rates. He said he does not expect a recession this year.
“The economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases,” he said.
Higher interest rates will trickle out through markets to make mortgages, car loans and borrowing by businesses more expensive. That is expected to slow consumption and investment, reducing demand in the economy and — Fed officials hope — eventually weighing down surging prices.
Central bankers plotted a notably more aggressive plan for controlling inflation than in December, when they last released economic projections. Officials now expect to raise rates to 2.8 percent by the end of 2023, based on the median estimate, up from 1.6 percent in their prior projections. That is high enough that, by the Fed’s own estimates, it might amount to actually tapping the brakes on the economy — not just taking a foot off the gas pedal.
The Fed’s Current Projections What Federal Reserve officials think rates should be in the next two years. End of 2023 End of 2022 Five Fed officials now think that rates could be higher than 3 percent by the end of 2023. 3.5 % 3.0 2.5 2.0 Each rectangle represents one Fed official’s judgment. 1.5 1.0 Current target rate 0.25% to 0.5% range 0.5 0 End of 2023 End of 2022 4.0 % Each square represents one Fed official’s judgment. 3.5 Five Fed officials now think that rates could be higher than 3 percent by the end of 2023. 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 Current target rate 0.25% to 0.5% range 0
“They knew their policy didn’t match the economic backdrop, and this is catch-up,” said Priya Misra, the head of global rates strategy at TD Securities. “They’re giving a tough message that they expect they will have to slow growth to bring inflation under control.”
With the help of their policy changes, central bankers expect inflation to begin to moderate on its own this year, but they have become concerned that a meaningful deceleration will take time.
The Fed’s quarterly economic projections, released alongside the rate decision, showed that officials expected inflation to hover around 4.3 percent at the end of 2022. While that is less than 6.1 percent increase in the 12 months through January, it is well above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent.
Mr. Powell on Wednesday noted that inflation is “well above” the Fed’s target and that supply chain disruptions have been larger and longer lasting than expected. Higher energy prices are further elevating inflation just as price increases broaden beyond areas directly impacted by the pandemic, seeping into rent and other service prices.
“High inflation takes a toll on everyone, but really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation,” Mr. Powell said.
The Fed aims for both price stability and maximum employment, and central bank officials have indicated that the labor market is meeting that latter goal, though they hope more workers will return as fears of catching the coronavirus ease and as child-care issues tied to school shutdowns and other virus mitigation measures fade.
Unemployment has dropped sharply, job openings are plentiful, and there are too few workers to go around. A booming job market has helped to push wage growth higher because employers are competing for workers and trying to retain their existing employees by paying more. Higher compensation could fuel inflation down the road, some economists worry: It gives workers more wherewithal to spend, and it leaves firms trying to cover climbing labor costs.
From an inflation standpoint, Mr. Powell said, recent wage growth has not been sustainable.
There is a “misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market, and that is leading to wages moving up in ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,” he said.
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, voted against the committee’s decision because he favored a larger interest rate increase of half a percentage point.
Mr. Bullard and some other Fed officials have argued that it would be a good idea to move rates up more quickly at first to signal that the central bank is prepared to beat back rapid price increases. But Mr. Powell made clear that, even if it is moving rates up steadily, the central bank as a whole knows it needs to act to restore price stability.
“We’re not going to let high inflation become entrenched,” Mr. Powell said.
At the same time, the Fed does not want to stoke uncertainty at a moment of towering geopolitical tensions. The Federal Open Market Committee directly addressed the possible economic implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in its statement.
“The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,” Fed officials said in their statement. “The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”
While Mr. Powell reinforced time and again how important it is to do whatever it takes to get inflation under control, he also made it clear that central bankers are hoping to engineer a soft landing: A situation where they can slow growth down to a maintainable level without derailing the economy and causing a recession.

Asked about that calibration on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that, in his view, “the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.” He cited strong demand, a healthy labor market and other conditions that he said were “signs” that the economy will be able to flourish “in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.”
In the 1980s, the Fed pushed interest rates to high levels — above the level of inflation — in order to slow the economy and weigh down inflation. In the process, central bank policy caused a recession that pushed unemployment up to nearly 11 percent.
Most economists have said that such a painful repeat is unlikely, though many have warned that a gentle, easy end to the current inflationary burst is not assured.
“It is way too soon to say it’s a pipe dream; it’s been a crazy year,” Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University, said earlier this week of the possibility of a soft landing. “It feels, with every passing month, increasingly unlikely.”
But the effects of the Fed’s actions to control inflation are likely to be palpable. Mortgage rates have already climbed thanks to the central bank’s signals that it would raise interest rates and, in coming months, begin to trim its balance sheet of bond holdings.
As higher rates weigh on hiring, they could eventually slow wage growth, and higher borrowing costs are likely to keep asset prices — including for stocks and homes — from rising as much as they draw buyers and investors away.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/16/business/fed-meeting-interest-rates
4,Why Fed's first rate hike since 2018 isn't the key to economy's future,2022-03-16T16:30:57Z,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, but it's how hawkish Jerome Powell and the Fed sound in the forecast that's key for the U.S. economy.","""It is high and elevated and rising at a rapid pace,"" she said. ""The Fed has to worry about inflation. We're not talking about just 3%. It's close to 8%. This is a massive overshoot.""
Fed Chair Powell indicated during recent testimony that he sees inflation running a little faster than the Fed's previous expectation, and any adjustment from the Fed is significant, Bostjancic said. But her view of the inflation outlook remains much higher than the median forecast of 2.7% year over year through Q4 2022 — closer to 4% than 3%. This is based on a labor market that is strong and a consumer that is resilient, and the Fed being behind the curve on inflation already.
But it's not the base case for Bostjancic, even if she says the Fed won't be blind to these signals.
There are risks on both sides of the Fed equation. If it is too hawkish and tightens too quickly, that can send the financial markets into a convulsion and lead to a mass selling of risk assets which feeds back into the real economy. Recent action in the bond market showing a narrowing of the spread between the two-year and 10-year treasuries stoked fears of an inverted yield curve, which is a signal that this worst-case, recessionary scenario, could play out.
While there are complicating factors such as the war in Ukraine, the most prominent issue for the Fed is that economic growth remains quite strong. If the Fed is shy about raising rates and reducing the balance sheet because of war, there is a risk that it gets even further behind on inflation, Bostjancic says. Consumers are still sitting on a high level of savings and benefitting from rising wages, and if the Fed gets further behind the curve on inflation by waiting, it will only increase the risk of the central bank becoming more hawkish later on.
The Federal Reserve is about to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018, but it's already time for the market to look past this well-telegraphed move, according to Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
The ""dot plot"" and the Fed's economic projections for GDP and inflation will need to be digested by the market, but ultimately, it's how Fed Chair Jerome Powell frames the Fed thinking on Wednesday that matters most. ""I want to hear how he handicaps the risks around growth and inflation. That will tell me something about the Fed's reaction function and that is the forward guidance,"" Bostjancic said.
While oil prices and the pain at the pump, which eased this week, caught the market's attention amid the outbreak of war in Europe, Bostjancic says food prices have double the weight of energy in the consumer price index and loom as an even larger factor in the inflation outlook — and are not immune to war. Commodities prices rising sharping are likely to get worse because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which impacts the production of wheat among other commodities and will reverberate through the global supply chain and ""turbocharge food prices even higher,"" she said.
Powell has already said rate hikes are coming, in spite of the outbreak of war.
Oxford Economics is in line with a market view of 175 basis points of total tightening by the Fed this year, but isn't sure whether those hikes remain limited to 25 basis points or include the potential for a 50 basis point hike at some point. ""Our view is that the economy is strong enough and demand still strong enough that even with the impact from war we still see growth at 3% or higher this year, so the Fed needs to get to a neutral rate as quickly as possible without destabilizing the market,"" Bostjancic said.
The situation is not ""dramatically different"" for the U.S.,"" she said. The U.S. economy is not immune to the war, but compared to Europe's economy, it is much better insulated. ""I don't think Ukraine necessarily slows the economy enough to take the edge off inflation,"" she added.
Powell will need to provide a view on where his concern primarily lies — how does the shock of this war impacts the U.S. economy versus the shock on the inflation side and the growth side, and the market will be looking closely for any signals from the Fed chair on what he emphasizes more in the risk analysis.
But in the end, Bostjancic says, ""The Fed has to come in. It can't control the war even if there is a knock-on effect in supply chains and scarcity of food and oil occur.""
There is also no way for a central bank to project the potential for a ceasefire in war.
Even in Europe, the ECB recently showed itself to be more hawkish in inclination, holding rates but saying it would wind down stimulus sooner rather than later. ""They need to fight inflation even if growth is slowing,"" Bostjancic said, and the ECB's recent policy views match an outlook on the Fed that suggests it can be more hawkish even in the face of larger uncertainty.
The war could potentially delay the Fed's balance sheet runoff, but by a month or two, and in her view, it should not alter the general path of normalization of both rates and the Fed's holdings in the bond market.
While this week's producer price index showed a slight undershoot of the inflation expectation and the latest wage inflation reading came down, the recent flow of data has reinforced that the inflationary pressures are still widespread and elevated, and the Fed needs to raise rates and has the ability to raise in a significant way. ""They have to come in and cool things off,"" Bostjancic said.
The market has already priced in an aggressive rate hike profile, and the market is not likely to be told by the Fed to price in less than it already has. ""The market is already in tightening conditions without the Fed having to do it. It's doing the work for the Fed,"" she said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/why-feds-first-rate-hike-since-2018-isnt-the-key-to-economys-future.html

Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with financials , technology and consumer discretionary shares - which largely endured the selloff this year - each climbing over 2.3%. Megacap names Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp rose 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively, powering the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq higher.
Big banks advanced 3% in anticipation of the first rate increase since 2018. Morgan Stanley led the gains with a 6.1% jump. The Fed is seen raising interest rates by at least 25 basis points later on Wednesday, in what would be the first in a series of increases this year as it steps up the fight against stubbornly high inflation.
The policy statement is due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) and will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Traders will be closely watching the updated quarterly economic and interest rate projections for clues on how fast rates will increase. ""The Fed in some ways was behind the curve. It gives the market a sense of comfort that the Fed is on the ball, they're going to start moving interest rates and we could get to a place where inflation begins to temper,"" said John Cunnison, chief investment officer at Baker Boyer in Walla Walla, Washington.
""Any good news on Ukraine is very likely to give market participants confidence that the Fed can increase rates without hurting growth.""

6,'Extremely sensitive' small businesses brace for Fed interest rate hikes,2022-03-16T16:02:11Z,Consumer borrowing costs are headed higher as interest rate hikes are enacted by the U.S. Federal Reserve.,"Consumer borrowing costs are headed higher as interest rate hikes are expected by the U.S. Federal Reserve starting on Wednesday.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to announce a raise in the central bank's key interest rate from near zero to combat rising inflation – a hurdle faced by cash-strapped small businesses that have already been forced to take on heavy debt loads during the COVID-19 crisis.
“It's still the case today that a lot of entrepreneurs, small business owners use credit cards,"" Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

Fed rate increases affect the rate of loans for things like homes, cars, and mortgages, meaning that consumers could soon tighten their belts and could have less disposable income to spend at neighborhood stores, bars, and restaurants.
""This is where we see one of the bigger differences between small and large businesses,” Bradley noted.
With inflation hitting record highs, large businesses have been planning for higher interest rates and factored that into their capital requirements and how they might meet their operational needs. For the smaller mom-and-pop business owner, there could be a challenging landscape ahead as they seek capital.

“We don’t need to move in pace with the Fed… but we will review our inflation outlook in our incoming policy meeting,” Diokno said, adding any policy decision by the Monetary Board would remain data driven—such as the latest numbers on inflation and domestic output—to avoid “unintended consequences.”
“The BSP has various tools. We have strong external buffers and liquidity-enhancing tools to stem the volatility that may arise due to the [US Fed] tightening. Our decision remains data dependent,” Diokno said.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday increased interest rates and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels next year. After keeping its benchmark interest rate anchored near zero since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would raise rates by 25 basis points, bringing the rate now into a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent.
The move will correspond with a hike in the prime rate and immediately send financing costs higher for many forms of consumer borrowing and credit. Fed officials indicated the rate increases would come with slower economic growth this year.

Diokno earier said there was no certain timetable for the BSP’s exit strategy from its pandemic interventions, especially with the onset of new COVID-19 variants that threaten the sustained recovery of the economy.
“We deem it prudent to leave some room for flexibility in policymaking to account for uncertainty and risk, especially as the situation remains very fluid,” he said.
Diokno said the timing and conditions under which the BSP would start unwinding its pandemic-induced interventions would continue to be guided by the inflation and growth outlook over the medium term and the risks surrounding such outlook. Julito G. Rada
The BSP in 2020 reduced the policy rate by a total of 200 basis points to a record-low 2 percent, and the reserve requirement ratios by another 200 basis points to 12 percent in a bid to unleash more liquidity into the financial system to be used by individuals and firms for productive activities.
It also extended provisional advances—a temporary arrangement between the BSP and the national government—to provide the government access to ample cash resources while revenue generation is weakened and fulfillment of the borrowing program is challenged by the scale of the borrowing need and the unpredictability of financial markets amid the pandemic.
The BSP injected around P2.3 trillion worth of liquidity into the domestic economy since the pandemic struck.

9,Moody's Mark Zandi,2022-03-16T15:14:46Z,"The Federal Reserve will likely ""increasingly err on the side of hawkish"" in its approach for the remainder of 2022, said Moody's Analytics' Mark Zandi.","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled Oversight of the Treasury Department's and Federal Reserve's Pandemic Response, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, December 1, 2021.
The Federal Reserve will likely ""increasingly err on the side of hawkish"" in its approach for the remainder of 2022, says Moody's Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, which would mark its first interest rate hike since December 2018. It also reflects a significant departure from the easing put in place to aid the economy through the pandemic.
The expected rate hike reflects ""where inflation is, where inflation expectations are, and just given the strength of the economy and a job market that is rip roaring,"" Zandi said. The Fed's decision is further compounded by uncertainty around the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and further supply chain disruptions.
""You add all that up, it says the Fed has to normalize interest rates quickly, and I think at this point more quickly than they think, at least in terms of their last forecast, and maybe even more quickly than what the markets think at this point,"" Zandi said.
Nearly half of the respondents to the latest CNBC Fed Survey said they see the central bank hiking rates five to seven times this year. While the survey shows that the rate hike cycle is seen ending at a peak fund rates of 2.4%, half of all respondents said they believe the central bank may have to raise rates above neutral to get control of inflation.
Zandi said there could be worries of stagflation, but he believes the Fed would ""short circuit that before we actually get stagflation. I don't think they'll tolerate stagflation because they know based on historical experience that if we get into that scenario, we'll ultimately suffer a recession.""
CNBC Fed Survey respondents see the probability of a recession occurring in the U.S. at 33% in the next 12 months, up 10 percentage points from the Feb. 1 survey.
Recent action in the bond market showing the spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds narrowing stoked fears of a yield inversion, which has been a recession signal in the past.
At this point, Zandi said the fixed income markets are saying that the ""number one problem here that they've got to resolve is high inflation, inflation expectations. But doing that without breaking the economy, pushing it into a recession is very difficult ... right now, the bond market is signaling a high probability that the Fed missteps and fails.""
""I don't think the market is signaling yet a recession but they're thinking along the same lines that I am – that it's going to be very difficult for the Federal Reserve to land the plane on the tarmac given all the things that are going on and all the things they have to navigate.""
That uncertainty was certainly noted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in his appearance before Congress on March 2.
""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways,"" Powell said. ""We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/fed-may-get-more-hawkish-than-the-market-thinks-moodys-mark-zandi.html

The global mood was also lifted by China's promise to roll out more stimulus for the economy and keep markets stable, fueling a rally in U.S.-listed Chinese shares.

11,Federal Reserve expected to raise rates,2022-03-16T13:41:43Z,It would be the first rate hike since 2018 as the central bank looks to rein in inflation.,"The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates on Wednesday – a move to combat soaring inflation as the U.S. comes out of the pandemic and economic uncertainty in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The expected quarter-point hike comes as prices have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a congressional hearing earlier this month that he supports raising the federal funds rate by 0.25%. Interest rates have been near 0% for about two years since the central bank cut rates as the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020. This will be the first time the central bank has hiked the rate since the end of 2018.
Prices have increased 7.9% over the past year – the fastest rate of inflation since 1982. Last month, prices were up 0.8% – an acceleration from January. Personal consumption expenditures, the preferred measure used by the Federal Reserve, showed prices, excluding often-volatile food and energy, up 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% in January.
While Powell signaled how much he wanted to raise the rate at the March meeting, he did not say how often he saw the Federal Reserve raising rates or by how much at subsequent meetings. Some economists have called for a more aggressive approach – with a .50% rate hike right out of the gate.
""They're behind the curve,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com of the Federal Reserve. ""If it hadn't been for the situation in Ukraine, there's a fair chance they would have come out of the box with a larger half-point increase.""
The United States and its allies have slapped sanctions on Russian banks, businesses and individuals and restricted trade over its invasion of Ukraine, adding uncertainty as the Central Bank moves to rein in soaring prices.
""The timing couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk. ""The disruptions we are seeing are adding fuel to a well kindled inflation fire that goes well beyond the energy sector and could touch much more of our daily lives.""
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the short and medium term have gone up, according to the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, reversing declines in January.
As prices continue to skyrocket, economists have been increasing their forecasts on how many times the Fed will raise rates this year – which could be as many as seven times.
If the Federal Reserve raises the federal interest rate, borrowing costs are going to go up for consumers. For credit card holders, a first increase of 0.25% may be inconsequential but multiple rate hikes over the next year or so could add up.
""It's that cumulative effect that should prompt you to take action now,"" said McBride. ""Look to grab a 0% or other low rate balance transfer offer that can insulate you from the rate hikes we expect to see.""
Mortgage rates have already been going up over the past few months in anticipation of higher rates and due to inflation. Auto loan rates are also expected to rise.
Should the Fed be more aggressive with raising interest rates, coupled with tightening spending power from higher costs for goods such as food and gas, economists have warned the chances of a recession next year have gone up.
But speaking Friday ahead of the Fed meeting, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who previously chaired the Federal Reserve, said the economy is strong and households in general are in good financial shape. She noted record job creation and declines in unemployment. Last month, the unemployment rate hit 3.8%.
""One reason one might worry about a recession is that you think that monetary policy in bringing down inflation can cause that. We have seen that on some occasions in the past, but we've also seen episodes in which there is a soft landing,"" said Yellen. ""I have confidence in the Fed to get inflation under control without causing a recession.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-expected-to-raise-rates/
12,Fed expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018,2022-03-16T13:17:19Z,"The Federal Reserve is expected today to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25%, marking the central bank's first substantial move to quell high inflation as prices rise at paces not seen in about 40 years.","The Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates by 0.25%, marking the central bank's first substantial move to quell high inflation as prices rise at paces not seen in about 40 years, Wednesday afternoon.
The Fed has not raised interest rates since 2018. In the face of the COVID pandemic, the central bank slashed the target on its benchmark interest rate to near zero — where it has remained for two years.
More interest rate increases will be needed to slow inflation in the U.S. Fed policymakers will also likely lean on a reduction in its $9 trillion balance sheet to further pull back on its support to the economy.
But the Fed will have to navigate carefully. A war in Ukraine and COVID-induced shutdowns in China are raising the risk of a Fed tightening cycle in the midst of a global slowdown.
When the central bank releases its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, keep an eye on the set of economic projections to be released alongside the statement. A round of ""dot plots"" mapping out each Fed policymaker's forecast for future interest rate hikes will be key to understanding the central bank's aggression in tackling inflation.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will answer questions from the press following the Fed's decision at 2:30 p.m. ET.

13,Canada’s inflation rate hits new three-decade high as price pressures broaden,2022-03-16T13:08:57Z,"Central banks are moving to tamp down inflation, with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday","Canada’s inflation rate hit a new three-decade high in February as consumers faced an array of price increases, adding pressure on the Bank of Canada to tame the situation with a speedy course of interest-rate hikes.
The Consumer Price Index rose 5.7 per cent in February from a year earlier, up from 5.1 per cent in January, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday. That was the highest inflation rate since August, 1991, and it marked the 11th consecutive month that inflation has surpassed the Bank of Canada’s target range of 1 per cent to 3 per cent.
Households are feeling the pinch on several fronts. Shelter costs rose 6.6 per cent, for the largest annual increase since 1983. Groceries rose 7.4 per cent, the most since 2009. And gas prices jumped 6.9 per cent in a single month.
The average of the central bank’s core measures of inflation – which strip out volatile components and give a better sense of broad-based price increases – rose to 3.5 per cent, also the highest since 1991.
Around two-thirds of the goods and services that make up Statscan’s CPI basket are experiencing inflation of more than 3 per cent, showing how sticker shock is getting tougher to avoid.
“If it feels like everything is getting more expensive, it’s because it is,” Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Securities Inc., said in a note to clients.
Central bankers have embarked on a lengthy process to tamp down inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday from record lows, and for the first time since 2018. The Bank of Canada did the same earlier this month. Financial analysts expect both central banks to raise borrowing costs several times this year and next.
Rising prices, interest rates and inflation signal nauseating conditions for homebuyers this spring
Why inflation, commodities shocks are in the usual recipe for a recession
Throughout the pandemic, central bankers have consistently underestimated the scale and duration of inflation. The Bank of Canada in January projected that annual rates would average 5.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 – a forecast that is already short of reality. The U.S. inflation rate hit a 40-year high of 7.9 per cent in February.
The latest threat to consumer prices is the Russia-Ukraine war, which has led to surging costs for wheat, gasoline, fertilizer and other products, on fears of supply shortages. However, central bankers can do very little to calm volatility in global commodity markets, making the situation even more complicated.
Several analysts said on Wednesday that Canada’s inflation rate could reach – or exceed – 6 per cent in short order.
“Whether it’s a supply or demand shock is becoming less and less consequential,” said Jean-François Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia. The central bank is “behind the curve” on rate hikes “and they need to move aggressively to try and signal that they’re very serious about bringing inflation back to target.”
In a recent speech, Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem would not rule out a rate hike of 50 basis points later this year. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.) A hike of that magnitude has not happened since 2000.
A key concern is that consumers, who are sensitive to price increases at gas pumps and supermarkets, will begin to see steep inflation as a long-term reality.
Inflation can be self-fulfilling, in that companies set prices and workers negotiate wages in anticipation of expected costs. Their expectations of inflation over the next two years have risen substantially, but remain “well anchored” over a five-year horizon, the central bank has said.
Not everyone agrees. Scotiabank said on Tuesday that inflation expectations have already become unmoored. “As of late 2021, the [central bank’s] priority should have been squarely on inflation” rather than supporting the labour market, read the report, which was co-written by René Lalonde, a former research director at the Bank of Canada.
Scotiabank estimates the central bank’s key interest rate – now at 0.5 per cent – will end the year at 2.5 per cent, which is the quickest pace of rate hikes that a major bank is projecting.
That would heap pressure on a Canadian consumer who is loaded up on debt. The household debt burden – more formally known as the ratio of credit market debt to disposable income – rose to 186 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest on record. The pandemic debt surge has been entirely driven by demand for residential mortgages.
Mr. Perrault said Canadians can handle a quick pace of rate hikes. The economy is growing quickly, highlighted by the addition of nearly 340,000 jobs in February, which took the employment rate back to prepandemic levels.
“Rates are rising in a remarkably strong growth environment,” he said. “To us, that means households are going to have much greater flexibility and greater ability to manage these higher rates than would be the case if inflation was going up and growth was not there.”
In February, consumers felt the impact of higher prices for dairy products, which rose 3.7 per cent from January. That stemmed from a decision last year by the Canadian Dairy Commission, a Crown corporation, to greatly increase the price that farmers receive for milk and butter, citing higher production costs. The decision was widely panned over its opaque nature and insensitive timing, given that grocery prices were already inflating quickly.
Food processors and retailers have passed on those higher costs, which took effect on Feb. 1. The price of fresh milk jumped 5.8 per cent, the fastest month-over-month pace since 1994, Wednesday’s report showed. Statscan noted that prices for all dairy products increased in February.

Prices are rising at the fastest rate since 1982, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) Report. The rising cost for gas, rent, and food is causing economic hardship for millions of American families today. And yet these inflationary pressures must be tackled without ending the fragile economic recovery. We still have 3.5 million missing jobs compared to pre-pandemic projections and the labor force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels for both men and women. COVID-related supply chain disruptions are ongoing and may get worse due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and recent lockdowns in Shenzhen and other parts of China.

The Federal Reserve must balance their two goals of maximum employment and price stability. Their task is incredibly difficult because of the imprecision of data and the difficulty of forecasting the future. Good monetary policy decisions rely on the input of many informed and dedicated people who bring their unique perspectives to the table when determining the best course of action. The need for everyone’s input is more important than ever as we face these unprecedented challenges. Yet, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, responsible for leading these efforts, currently only has four of its seven seats confirmed.

They have the skills and judgment needed to fight inflation and maintain economic stability as we continue recovering from the pandemic.
In their current roles at the Federal Reserve, Powell and Brainard have helped steer the U.S. economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, and their renominations will ensure continuity and confidence in Federal Reserve leadership. Jefferson is a world-renowned monetary economist and has studied domestic economic issues for decades. Cook brings a wealth of bipartisan experience, serving in the Treasury Department under President Clinton and George W. Bush and on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.
Together these nominees have decades of proven real-world experience and academic excellence, significant contributions to economic growth and hard-earned resiliency, demonstrating they understand how to make the economy work for working Americans — especially during challenging moments like these. Moreover, Biden’s nominees have broad bipartisan support and the trust of leading economists from across the nation. In a Feb. 8 letter to Senate Leadership and the Senate Banking Committee, I joined 180 of the top economic policymakers and scholars in the country to urge a swift approval of these nominees.
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans on the Banking Committee are not having rigorous debate on the merits of the candidates, or providing valuable oversight to the process. They are playing politics, refusing to show up to work and freezing the confirmation process in its tracks, throwing uncertainty into the markets, and putting the financial wellbeing of hardworking American families at risk. Those chosen to serve in the United States Senate have the constitutional duty to advise and consent on presidential nominees. Regardless of how lawmakers decide to vote on individual appointments, the American people sent them there to vote — not sit on the sidelines. Perhaps more importantly, research shows that countries that give their central banks more independence have lower inflation rates on average. That means that if you play politics with the Federal Reserve and reduce its independence, you should expect higher inflation.
The Federal Reserve needs to balance risks. If we raise interest rates too quickly, you risk slamming the economy back into a recession and leaving too many people out of work. If you raise rates too slowly, you risk further inflation. The Federal Reserve Board makes these choices by bringing a wide range of data and perspectives to the discussion to assess these risks. These are not political decisions. The goals are clear: steer the economy toward maximum employment and stable prices. The problem is that the Federal Reserve has been left without the team of people who lead these discussions and vote on the decision. If we are going to effectively reduce inflation while preventing a recession, we must move forward with a vote on Biden’s extremely qualified slate of Federal Reserve nominees without delay.

March 16 (UPI) -- For the first time since 2018, the U.S. central bank is expected to increase interest rates during a policy meeting on Wednesday, a measure to fight rising inflation that's being affected by high gas prices and Russia's war in Ukraine. The Federal Reserve will conclude its policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon, at which time it's expected to announce a quarter-point rate increase. The rate has been near zero since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed could also set a forecast for future increases. Advertisement
The primary factors pressing the need for a rate hike include the rising costs of fuel and food. Government figures for February showed that U.S. inflation rose on a 12-month basis to the highest level in 40 years.
The Federal Reserve is also facing fresh uncertainties, including the fighting in Ukraine that's led to a U.S. oil embargo and rising prices at the pump. A new spike in coronavirus cases in China may also cause new supply chain issues.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers earlier this month that he favors a rate hike at Wednesday's meeting.
""Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways,"" he said. ""We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.""

""There's a dark cloud of uncertainty over this meeting, but at the end of the day, they know they're at zero,"" Jim Caron, chief fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told CNBC.
""The economy is coming into full employment rapidly and inflation is way too high. You add that all up and that means they've got to raise rates. The degree of uncertainty is extraordinary. They told us what they were going to do. They did that to get rid of the uncertainty.""
Experts say that Americans can expect to see the impact of the rate hike in their credit card and mortgage payments, but they should see a benefit to other areas like savings accounts, for example.
The Fed's announcement on Wednesday comes a day after Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her name from consideration as President Joe Biden's nominee to a seat on the Fed's board of governors.

17,Federal Reserve expected to raise borrowing rate in risky pursuit of 'soft landing',2022-03-16T11:31:55Z,The Federal Reserve is set to raise borrowing costs enough to tame inflation but not too much to send the economy into a recession.,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will launch one of the most difficult tasks a central bank can attempt: Raise borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, but not so much as to topple the economy into recession.With a war raging in Europe and price increases at a four-decade high, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will seek to engineer a ""soft landing"": A gradual slowdown in economic activity that helps curb surging prices, while keeping the job market and economy expanding.Yet many economists worry that with the price of gas and commodities spiking, the additional burden of higher interest rates could choke off growth entirely.""You've got to be both lucky and good"" to avoid causing a downturn, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served as vice chair of the Fed from 1994 to 1996, when the central bank was widely seen as achieving a soft landing.As a first step, the Fed is set to raise borrowing rates several times this year, beginning this week with a quarter-point increase in its benchmark short-term rate. Policymakers will also discuss when and how fast to shrink the Fed's $9 trillion in bond holdings, a step that would also have the effect of tightening credit for consumers and businesses.Such moves mark a sharp turn away from the Fed's ultra-low-rate policies, which it enacted when the pandemic recession erupted two years ago. By pinning its key rate near zero for two years and buying trillions in bonds, the Fed has kept borrowing costs at historically low levels and helped boost stock prices.The Fed, by its own admission, underestimated the breadth and persistence of high inflation after the pandemic struck. Many economists say the central bank made its task riskier by waiting too long to begin raising rates.The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which reached a record low of 2.65% in January 2021, has jumped to 3.85% in the past three months, as Powell has signaled the Fed's intentions and inflation has spiraled higher.By raising short-term rates, the Fed hopes to make it costlier to buy homes and cars and to boost credit card rates and borrowing costs for businesses. The resulting pullback in spending should, in turn, slow inflation, Powell told Congress two weeks ago. Strong consumer spending, fueled by stimulus checks and steady hiring and pay raises, has collided with supply shortfalls to raise inflation to 7.9%, the highest rate since 1982.""People will spend less, and what we hope to achieve is bringing the economy to a level where demand and supply are in sync,"" Powell said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.If the Fed succeeds, he said, the economy should keep growing, and unemployment, over time, should stay low - it's now 3.8% - or fall further.""I think it's more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing,"" Powell told a House panel a day before his Senate testimony.Yet the Fed faces a dizzying array of uncertainties that will make its task particularly challenging. The economy is still working through shortages of labor and parts stemming from the disruptions of the pandemic. And now prices are rising further for oil, gas, wheat, and other commodities because of Russia's war against Ukraine.The clearest soft landing was achieved in 1994 and 1995, when the Fed under Chairman Alan Greenspan raised its benchmark rate from 3% to 6% as the economy was rebounding after a brief recession. Inflation, which wasn't a problem then, declined further. And unemployment leveled off at about 5.5% before resuming its decline two years later.Blinder calculates that the Fed also engineered soft landings in 1965 and 1983. But he worries that this time, the odds are stacked against the Fed and that its rate hikes may end up causing an economic setback.""It's just so hard in this environment,"" he said. ""You have to have a world in which nothing comes to knock over the apple cart. And for Jay Powell and the Fed, the whole world is just apple cart after apple cart getting knocked over.""One of those apple carts is the sharp rise in gas prices since the invasion, up 65 cents to $4.33 a gallon, on average, nationwide. The increase will send inflation higher, while probably also slowing growth - two conflicting trends that are difficult for the Fed to manage simultaneously.Last week, Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.9%, down from a previous estimate of 3.1%. Others foresee growth decelerating to 2%, down from 5.7% last year.The economy's steady expansion does provide some cushion against higher rates and more expensive gas. Consumers are spending at a healthy pace, and employers keep rapidly hiring. There are still 11.3 million job openings, far outnumbering the unemployed.In 1998, the late MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch wrote that economic expansions didn't die of ""natural causes."" Rather, he said, ""they were all murdered by the Fed over the issue of inflation."" He meant that the Fed raised rates too much out of fear of inflation and failed to achieve a soft landing.Yet many economists say that view is outdated and refers mostly to Fed policies from the 1950s through early 1980s. The Fed now operates differently. It communicates its plans more clearly with the public. And it pays closer attention to factors such as inflation expectations, which measure where consumers, businesses and investors see inflation heading.Such measures are important because if people think inflation will head higher, they will demand bigger paychecks. Companies, in turn, will raise prices further to offset their higher labor costs.Inflation expectations, particularly in the short-term, have been rising steadily, though longer-term measures suggest that people still expect inflation to return closer to the Fed's 2% annual target over time.Emi Nakamura, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that in the 1970s, even as inflation soared, it was still a matter of debate among economists whether the Fed's rate policies could truly control inflation.Yet if the Fed keeps raising rates for another year or two, as many economists expect, it could eventually lift them high enough that consumers and business reduce spending and throw the economy into reverse. Unemployment would rise and a downturn could begin.Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont, suggested, though, that the Fed won't reach that possibility until next year or later.""Let's at least get a few rate hikes under our belt before we start worrying about that,"" he said. ""We have some distance to go before that becomes a realistic worry.""",https://abc7.com/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-fed/11655519/

More positive developments on the outlook for Russia-Ukraine talks also helped boost U.S. and global equities.
Contracts on the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq were each higher by more than 1% in pre-market trading. These moves built on gains from Tuesday, when the S&P 500 closed higher by more than 2% to shake off some of the volatility recently gripping U.S. equities. Treasury yields steadied after moving sharply higher, and the 10-year yield hovered above 2.1% for its highest level since 2019.
At least one Kremlin official reportedly struck an upbeat tone on discussions with Ukraine early Wednesday, helping provide a boost to stocks recently roiled by geopolitical turmoil. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested a proposal to have Ukraine become a neutral country while keeping its armed forces ""could be viewed as a certain kind of compromise,"" Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
Energy prices unwound more recent gains, and West Texas intermediate (CL=F) crude oil futures briefly dipped below $95 per barrel to fall further into a bear market. Earlier this week, U.S. crude oil first entered bear market territory, with prices sliding more than 20% from recent closing highs set just a week ago. Brent crude, the international standard, hovered below $100 per barrel.
Investors this week have been gearing up to receive the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision, which is likely to show the first of multiple interest rate hikes this year. Currently, the benchmark interest rate has been kept near zero since mid-2020, with the central bank using low rates and a series of other monetary policy tools to keep financial conditions running smoothly amid the pandemic. The Fed last raised interest rates in 2018.
Already, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in recent weeks that he would back a 25 basis point interest rate hike at the Fed's March meeting. Such an increase would be in-line with the Fed's typical hike size per meeting over the past two decades, and would begin the process of tightening financial conditions to gradually bring down demand and inflation. And in opting against a more aggressive 50 basis point rate hike — which some market participants had called for at the beginning of the year — the Fed would also likely avoid delivering a shock to markets already reeling from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Story continues
And importantly, in addition to offering a decision on raising rates, the Fed will also release an updated Summary of Economic Projections, or ""dot plot,"" showing what central bank officials are thinking for where interest rates and growth in the economy may be headed in the near-term. And to that end, many pundits expect to see the Fed upgrade its outlooks on inflation and the labor market this year.
The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — or the Fed's preferred inflation gauge excluding volatile food and energy prices — last rose at a 6.1% annual rate in January. And since then, more recent prints on consumer and producer price inflation have pointed to even steeper run-up in prices.
""The dot plot should increase given all the news that we've had between December and today,"" Michael Kushma, Morgan Stanley Investment Management chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""We've got a strong labor market, higher than expected inflation. Oil prices, energy prices, commodity prices are much higher now then they were back then.

Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also said some formulations of agreements with Ukraine were close to being agreed.
Western governments have slapped tough sanctions on Russia for the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special operation.”

27,"U.S. Federal Reserve begins inflation fight with key rate hike, more to come",2022-03-16T07:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve launched a high-risk effort Wednesday to tame the worst inflation since the 1970s, raising its benchmark short-term interest rate and signalling potentially up to seven rate hikes this year.","WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve launched a high-risk effort Wednesday to tame the worst inflation since the 1970s, raising its benchmark short-term interest rate and signalling potentially up to seven rate hikes this year.
The Fed’s quarter-point hike in its key rate, which it had pinned near zero since the pandemic recession struck two years ago, marks the start of its effort to curb the high inflation that has followed the recovery from the recession. The rate hikes will eventually mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses.
The central bank’s policy-makers expect inflation to remain elevated and to end 2022 at 4.3%, according to updated quarterly projections they released Wednesday. That’s far above the Fed’s 2% annual target. The officials also now forecast much slower economic growth this year, of 2.8%, down from its 4% estimate in December.
Chair Jerome Powell is steering the Fed into a sharp U-turn. Officials had kept rates ultralow to support growth and hiring during the recession and its aftermath. As recently as December, Fed officials had expected to raise rates just three times this year. Now, its projected seven hikes would raise its short-term rate to 1.875% at the end of 2022. It could increase rates by a half-point at future meetings.
Fed officials also forecast four additional hikes in 2023, boosting its benchmark rate to 2.8%. That would be the highest level since March 2008. Borrowing costs for mortgage loans, credit cards and auto loans will likely rise as a result.
Powell is hoping that the rate hikes will achieve a difficult and narrow objective: Raising borrowing costs enough to slow growth and tame high inflation, yet not so much as to topple the economy into recession.
Yet many economists worry that with inflation already so high — it reached 7.9% in February, the worst in four decades — and with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine driving up gas prices, the Fed may have to raise rates even higher than it now expects and potentially tip the economy into recession.

The Fed is expected to raise rates for the first time in three years later on Wednesday (1800 GMT) and give guidance on future tightening.
European bourses were poised to open stronger. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures and German DAX futures were up about 0.9% in early deals, and FTSE futures were 0.6% higher. U.S. stock futures also pointed higher, with S&P 500 e-minis , up 0.2%.
The rise in Asian shares came a day after mainland China and Hong Kong equity indexes had tumbled in reaction to spiking coronavirus infections in China and fading expectations for a rate cut by the People's Bank of China. Chinese market volatility continued on Wednesday, with a strong early rebound in China's CSI300 index evaporating by late morning. But it charged higher after Vice Premier Liu He indicated China plans to take measures to boost the economy and would also announce policies favourable to capital markets.
The CSI300 was last up more than 3.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index also extended gains in the afternoon, surging more than 8% at one point, leading a more than 3% rise in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan. Elsewhere, Australian shares and Seoul's Kospi were up about 1.1%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 1.6%.
Liu's comments helped to ease worries that encouraging economic data for January and February were leading to complacency among policymakers in Beijing. ""People are concerned that (Chinese) policymakers would believe that the economy is doing much better and growth is rebounding and there's no need for further policy easing measures,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
China has seen increasing positive changes in its economic performance backed up by surprisingly good economic data, but the impact of the latest COVID-19 resurgence need to be watched, a statistics bureau spokesman said on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Chinese health authorities reported a slight drop in new cases compared to a day earlier, although major Chinese cities continue to grapple with controlling the spread of the virus.
The gains in Asia followed a relief rally overnight on Wall Street driven by hopes of a resolution in Ukraine. The S&P 500 gained 2.14%, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.92% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.82%. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday peace talks were sounding more realistic but more time was needed, as Russian air strikes killed five people in the capital Kyiv and the refugee tally from Moscow's invasion reached 3 million.
EYES ON FED Analysts at ING said in a note that market moves in Asia would be ""cautious"" ahead of the Fed meeting later in the global day.
Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates by at least 25 basis points amid surging prices. Traders will also be closely watching the Fed for details on how it plans to end its bond-buying program. U.S. bond yields fell in Asian trade, with the benchmark 10-year note yield at 2.1545%, after earlier rising to 2.169%, the highest since June 2019.
The two-year yield was last at 1.8433% from a close of 1.857%. The U.S. dollar was down slightly against a basket of peers, trading at 98.861, and lower against the yen at 118.22 albeit still near a five-year high. The euro edged up 0.16% to $1.0969.
Oil prices, which had traded lower early in the session, turned higher, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine continuing to stoke volatility. Global benchmark Brent crude rose 0.93% to $100.84 per barrel, and U.S. crude added 0.44% to $96.86.
Highlighting the impact of global disruptions and soaring oil costs, Japan reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit in February as an energy-driven surge in import costs caused by massive supply constraints added to vulnerabilities for the world's third-largest economy. Spot gold was little changed at $1,916.61 per ounce.

30,Federal Reserve’s Long-Awaited Rate Hike Is Here: Powell Announces 0.25% Increase,2022-03-16T04:00:00Z,The central bank predicted six more rate hikes ahead in 2022.,"Topline
The Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate hike on Wednesday—the first increase since 2018, while also forecasting a more-than-expected six additional hikes this year, as the central bank looks to combat surging inflation and ease concerns about the economic impact from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The central bank predicted six more rate hikes ahead in 2022. Tom Williams/Pool via ASSOCIATED PRESS
Key Facts
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point—the first increase in more than three years—as it looks to address surging inflation, which remains at 40-year highs, up 7.9% from a year ago. Fed officials said in a statement that they predict six more rate hikes this year and three more in 2023 (up from a previous forecast of three rate hikes each year). The central bank now sees a consensus federal funds rate of 1.9% by the end of 2022, though it “anticipates” that ongoing increases in the target rate “will be appropriate.” Fed policymakers had been indicating for months that they would begin raising rates in March, starting with a 0.25% increase, though Fed Chair Jerome Powell had stressed before the meeting that the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates “more aggressively” if higher inflation persists. Fed officials have also been warning about the “highly uncertain” economic impact from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, describing that the conflict is likely to “create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.” The central bank now forecasts higher inflation and lower economic growth in 2022, with the Fed’s projection for U.S. GDP growth this year falling to 2.8% from a previous forecast of 4%.
Tangent
Stocks pared back gains immediately after the Fed announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at one point giving up a nearly 500-point gain from earlier in the day.
What To Watch For:
How quickly the central bank will unwind its massive balance sheet. The Federal Reserve said it would “begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.”
Surprising Fact:
The 0.25% interest rate increase was approved on an 8-to-1 vote: St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had advocated for a 0.50% rate hike instead.
Crucial Quote:
The Fed’s statement “isn’t too shocking,” says Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli, pointing out that “the language on inflation is strengthened, as one would have expected.” More worryingly, he says, the central bank warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have “stagflationary implications (hurting growth and boosting inflation)” for the U.S. economy.
Key Background:
Stocks have had a dismal start to 2022, with investors not only whipsawed by the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policy but also by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing conflict has dragged markets lower and led to a surge in energy prices that has only exacerbated high inflation: Oil prices recently spiked to a high of around $130 per barrel, and though they’ve moderated somewhat, gas prices are soaring. The S&P 500 now sits in correction territory—more than 10% below its record high earlier this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite briefly fell into a bear market in recent weeks. Wall Street experts are now warning of rising recession risks, with some predicting stocks to fall into a bear market this year while the U.S. economy becomes plagued by stagflation—high inflation and slow economic growth.

TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar jumped on Wednesday after comments from a senior Chinese official boosted hopes for more stimulus, while the U.S. dollar traded near a five-year high against the yen with markets expecting the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for the first time in three years.
The Aussie added 0.34% to $0.7223, putting some distance from Tuesday's trough at $0.71650, which was the lowest level this month, after Xinhua news agency cited Vice Premier Liu He saying China will roll out policy steps favourable for its capital markets.
""Australia and China have a very strong economic relationship, so the Australian dollar is always going to move on China news,"" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.

""Beyond just China, it's very easy for Aussie to rise on any positive developments for commodities right now.""
The U.S. dollar lost 0.30% to 6.3629 yuan in the offshore market , which would be its steepest daily drop in a month.
The greenback stood at 118.305 yen , little changed from Tuesday, when it reached 118.450 yen for the first time since January 2017.
The U.S. currency got support from a leap in long-term U.S. Treasury yields to a more than two-year peak ahead of the Fed decision, while the yen has also been undermined by surging prices for oil and other commodity, weakening Japan's terms of trade.
Money markets are fully priced for a first interest rate hike in three years, and giving 13% odds of a half-percentage point increase.
Meanwhile, hopes of some breakthrough in Russia-Ukraine negotiations to end the conflict saw the euro extend its recovery from a plunge to a nearly 22-month low earlier this month.
That helped keep the dollar index - which measures the greeback against six peers, with the euro the most heavily weighted - stuck below 99, from as high as 99.415 at the start of last week. The index last stood at 98.853, down 0.08% from Tuesday.
""Whether it's forlorn or otherwise, there does seem to be some enduring optimism (coming from) the fact that Russia and the Ukraine are still talking,"" helping the euro to stabilise, said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.
For the greenback, ""the bigger question will be that there is a lot of historical evidence that the dollar peaks as soon as the Fed commences the tightening cycle, so there's a lot of interest in whether what the Fed does turn out to be something of a watershed in terms of a peak,"" with the dollar index topping out around 100, Attrill said.
The euro added 0.17% to $1.09710, from a trough of $1.08060 on March 7.
Sterling rose 0.08% to $1.3053, ticking up from a 16-month bottom of $1.3000 in the previous session, with the Bank of England announcing its policy decision on Thursday, and widely seen hiking rates by another quarter point.
""With the UK more exposed to the Russian supply shock than the U.S., we think the risks lie with disappointment by the BoE and a weaker GBP down to $1.2894,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Kristina Clifton wrote in a client note.
The Bank of Japan is expected to leave ultra-loose policy settings in place when reviews its policy on Friday.

Summary Adds economic data
Markets expect quarter-percentage-point rate hike
Policy statement, projections due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT)
Fed's Powell scheduled to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will close the door on its ultra-easy pandemic-era monetary policy and step up the fight against stubbornly high inflation with the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes this year.
The shift, beginning with an expected quarter-percentage-point increase in the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate, has been in the works since last fall and has already driven up the cost of home mortgages and other key types of credit in anticipation of what the Fed will do to curb prices that are rising at their fastest pace in 40 years.

Yet the urgency surrounding the Fed's policy meeting this week has intensified because inflation has shown no signs of easing and may even rise further on the back of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which fueled an oil price spike this month.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
The precise language of the Fed's new policy statement and the details of updatedquarterly economic and interest rate projections will provide the first concrete guidance about how all that has influenced policymakers, and in particular whether it has rattled faith that the current economic expansion can stay on track even as inflation is driven lower.
U.S. retail sales data released on Wednesday showed what may be early evidence of consumers pulling back. Sales rose 0.3% in February, below the Reuters consensus forecast of a 0.4% gain, and spending on more expensive gas helped divert consumers' cash away from other goods. A majority of respondents in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would trim spending on restaurants and movies, to areas already hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, if gas prices continued to rise.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to lawmakers in Congress earlier this month, said he felt it was ""more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing ... which is get inflation back under control without a recession.""
But he also acknowledged the central bank was in uncertain terrain, perhaps more reminiscent of the high-inflation days of the 1970s than of the weak inflation environment that has conditioned monetary policy since the early 1990s.
""We haven't faced this challenge in a long time,"" Powell said in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. ""But we all know the history and we all know what we need to do.""
The new projections due to be issued alongside the policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) will show just how aggressive officials think they may need to be, and whether policymakers see the target federal funds rate rising to the sort of restrictive levels that could actually crimp the economy and increase unemployment.
Since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the Fed has penciled in those sorts of restrictive policies only once, in response to former President Donald Trump's run-up of deficit spending in 2017 and 2018, but rates never rose that high before the economy started to buckle.
Reuters Graphics
Inflation is now the motivation. The Fed's preferred gauge of price pressures is currently increasing at an annual rate that is triple the central bank's 2% target, and the environment of war, rising energy costs, and climbing wages has drawn parallels to the 1970s and early 1980s when the Fed pushed the economy into recession to break the cycle.
If the pandemic led to unpredictable economics, developments in Europe have made the situation almost Byzantine when it comes to forecasting.
The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude , for example, rose about 33% to $123 a barrel in the days following Russia's Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine. On Wednesday, it was trading at about $98 a barrel.
But that decline in oil prices has been driven largelyby new coronavirus-related lockdowns in China that could cause economic problems of their own - including more inflation.
The situation ""couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s. The disruptions we are seeing are adding fuel to a well kindled inflation fire,"" wrote Diane Swonk, chief economist at GrantThonton.
Powell ""will be walking a tightrope, balancing the need to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown"" if the central bank is seen raising rates so fast it might risk a recession, she added.
A 'NIMBLE' APPROACH
Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour after the release of the policy statement and projections. In addition to elaborating on the statement, he will likely provide an update on the discussions of when and how fast to reduce the Fed's roughly $8.5 trillion portfolio of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a second tool for tightening monetary policy that will be deployed later in the year.
Powell has used words like ""nimble"" to describe his approach to a situation in which policymakers may have to adapt on the fly, and in which they have been repeatedly fooled by economic developments from a faster-than-expected recovery to the slow return of workers to jobs.
Reuters Graphics
The language of the new policy statement and the details of the new projections will, however, put the Fed's broader thinking on display.
As of December, most Fed officials felt they could get a grip on inflation with a relatively light touch that involved increasing the target federal funds rate, currently near zero, to just 2.1% by the end of 2024, a level still not considered restrictive by policymakers.
But policymakers at that point also felt inflation for 2022 would be just 2.6% and on its way down as the U.S. and world economies worked through the supply chain issues and other problems created by the pandemic - an outlook that also is proving out of step.
Given the level of inflation, ""the message has to be at least somewhat hawkish,"" wrote Evercore ISI analysts Krishna Guha and Peter Williams, even if the volatile events of recent weeks mean officials will also want to stress ""that now more than ever nothing is set in stone.""

The U.S. central bank's balance sheet more than doubled during the pandemic as it scooped up trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, first to calm markets and then to support the economy.
It ended those bond purchases this month. Shrinking the portfolio will help tighten monetary policy and financial conditions, complementing the Fed's move to higher interest rates to bring inflation back under control, Powell said. read more
Earlier this year the Fed said balance sheet reductions would generally happen not through outright sales of bonds but by allowing securities to roll off as they mature. Investors expect the Fed to set monthly caps to control the reduction and make it predictable.
""We'll be mindful of the broader financial context when we make the decision on timing"" of reductions, Powell said. ""We always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability, and we want to avoid adding uncertainty in a highly uncertain situation already.""

The Fed is at an inflection point after two years of trying to help the economy to recover from the damage inflicted by the global pandemic. While the coronavirus continues to disrupt commerce around the world, the US economy has staged a swift recovery. America’s job market has rebounded rapidly from steep pandemic job losses that had pushed unemployment to 14.7 percent, and businesses are now struggling to find workers.

A surge in consumer spending has helped to push the rate of inflation to levels not seen since the 1980s. Instead of echoing the anemic slog back from the 2007-09 recession — one that kept millions of applicants out of work and left inflation tepid despite years of rock-bottom rates — the pandemic bounce-back has been vigorous.
Judging by inflation, it may even have too much heat, which is why the Fed is trying to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace.
“The economy is very strong,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference following the announcement, calling recent growth “robust” and the outlook “solid,” while saying that the labor market is “extremely tight.”

“Wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years,” he said, noting that inflation is “well above” the Fed’s target and that supply chain disruptions have been larger and longer-lasting than expected. Higher energy prices are pushing up inflation even more, just as price pressures broaden.
Higher interest rates will trickle out through markets to make mortgages, car loans, and borrowing by businesses more expensive. That is expected to slow consumption and investment, reducing demand in the economy and — Fed officials hope — eventually weighing down surging prices.
Central bankers plotted a more aggressive plan for controlling inflation than in December, when they last released economic projections. Officials now expect to raise rates to 2.8 percent by the end of 2023, based on the median estimate, up from 1.6 percent in their prior projections. That is high enough that, by the Fed’s own estimates, it might amount to actually tapping the brakes on the economy — not just taking a foot off the gas pedal.
“They knew their policy didn’t match the economic backdrop, and this is catch-up,” said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities. “They’re giving a tough message that they expect they will have to slow growth to bring inflation under control.”
With the help of their policy changes, central bankers still expect inflation to begin to slow on its own this year, but they have become concerned that a meaningful deceleration will take time.
Advertisement
The Fed’s quarterly economic projections, released alongside the rate decision, showed that officials expected inflation to hover around 4.3 percent at the end of 2022. While that is less than 6.1 percent increase in the 12 months through January, it is well above the Fed’s goal of 2 percent.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, voted against the committee’s decision because he favored a larger interest rate increase of half a percentage point.
The Fed directly addressed the possible economic implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in its statement.
“The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,” Fed officials said in their statement. “The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.”
Powell, speaking at the news conference, noted that the invasion of Ukraine and related events are a “downside risk.”
While the Fed is raising rates partly because inflation is so rapid, officials have also taken solace in labor market progress. Unemployment has dropped sharply, job openings are plentiful, and there are too few workers to go around.
The Fed aims for both price stability and maximum employment, and central bank officials have indicated that the labor market is meeting that latter goal, though they hope more workers will return as fears of catching the coronavirus ease and as child-care issues tied to school shutdowns and other virus mitigation measures fade.

A booming job market has helped to push wage growth higher because employers are competing for workers and trying to retain their existing employees by paying more. Higher compensation could fuel inflation down the road, some economists worry: It gives workers more wherewithal to spend, and it leaves firms trying to cover climbing labor costs.
The Fed is trying to avoid a situation in which both consumers and companies come to believe that prices will continue to increase briskly year after year. Expectations for higher inflation could prompt consumers to accept cost increases, could lead workers to ask for bigger raises, and could give businesses the confidence to continue lifting prices.
The question is just how far the central bank will have to go to make sure that price gains slow and inflation expectations remain under control.
Central bankers are hoping to engineer a soft landing: a situation where they can slow growth to a maintainable level without derailing the economy and causing a recession. Powell has been clear that he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve price stability.
Asked Wednesday about that calibration, Powell said that, in his view, “the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated.” He cited strong demand, a healthy labor market, and other conditions that he said were signs that the economy will be able to flourish “in the face of less accommodative monetary policy.”",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/16/business/fed-raises-rates-projects-six-more-increases-this-year/

A Fed controlled by Democrats will pursue the same broad agenda regardless of who is in the supervision seat, and staff and governors may be able to work on some measures while the White House figures out a new nominee, analysts said.
But major policy decisions will need to be led and backed by a confirmed Fed official to gain support in Congress. Here is the regulatory agenda that will fall to a confirmed vice chair:

DE-REGULATION REDUX?
Over the past four years, Quarles led a review of regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, arguing they were too blunt and onerous. Democrats accused Quarles of saving Wall Street billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks, and they want the Fed to revisit some of those changes.
Among the most contentious were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades and stripping the Fed of its power to fail banks on their annual “stress tests” based on subjective concerns.
Whoever replaces Quarles would have to pick which of these to address. Even if Raskin had been confirmed quickly, the process of overhauling many of these rules was expected to be extremely time-consuming.

Climate change, a top policy priority for Democrats, is expected to rapidly rise on the Fed agenda under new leadership.
So far, the Fed has asked lenders to explain how they are mitigating climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, with the industry expecting to progress to a formal climate change scenario analysis in 2023, Reuters has reported.
Those projects are expected to accelerate. The big question will be whether the Fed pushes for restrictions or stiffer capital requirements on banks with significant exposures to polluting industries or other climate-specific risks.
Fed officials may end up treading more carefully than progressives had hoped, as Raskin's nomination was ultimately sunk by concerns she would push too aggressively on climate risk.
BANK M&A
The delay in finding Quarles' replacement may compound a logjam in approving bank tie-ups since last year due to uncertainty over Fed personnel changes. read more
Some pending deals have been approved following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's renomination, but the industry is still waiting for the Fed and the Justice Department to decide on a potential new policy for bank deals. The next regulatory chief is expected to lead the committee that scrutinizes potential tie-ups, suggesting any new merger policy may also need her backing.
Without that certainty, bankers and lawyers have said they would be reluctant to pursue new tie-ups.
FINTECH FRAMEWORK
The Fed is also expected to tackle a regulatory blueprint for ""fintech"" companies that are quickly chipping away at the traditional financial sector.
It's exploring how banks intersect with fintechs, particularly with smaller lenders that may outsource more services and infrastructure. Fintechs are also lobbying the Fed for access to its payments system.
While other banking regulators have worked for years to bring fintechs under their regulatory umbrella, the Fed has resisted, fearing doing so could create systemic risks. But as the sector continues to balloon, the Fed is expected to act.
SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO
Another issue on the table is the supplementary leverage ratio, a rule created after the decade-ago crisis requiring banks to hold capital against assets regardless of their risk.
The Fed had to temporarily ease that rule in the midst of the pandemic as a glut of bank deposits and Treasury bonds drove up capital requirements on what are viewed as safe assets.
Despite intense bank lobbying, the Fed let that relief expire last year but promised to review the overall rule. The Fed has yet to publish a proposal.
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT
The central bank will also play a key role in a long-awaited overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules which promote lending in lower-income communities.
The Fed, which shares responsibility for writing the rules with other bank regulators, hopes the CRA can be updated to reflect the growth in online banking, while still ensuring lenders make meaningful contributions to the poorer areas they serve.
A new Fed regulation chief would likely have to be in place before the Fed could sign off on the changes.

37,How the Fed's rate hikes could affect U.S. consumers,2022-03-16T04:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that it plans to lift them further in the coming months to battle high inflation, a shift that will likely be felt by most households.","A screen displays the Fed rate announcement as a specialist trader work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 16, 2022.

March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled that it plans to lift them further in the coming months to battle high inflation, a shift that will likely be felt by most households.
Higher interest rates can raise borrowing costs for consumers seeking to buy homes and cars, a shift already taking place. Those increased costs could help to cool inflation by lowering demand and slowing economic growth.
Here is a look at the various ways higher interest rates could affect borrowers.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
MORTGAGES
Mortgage rates started rising in anticipation of the Fed's rate increases and are likely to go up further now that the Fed is bumping up short-term borrowing costs. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.27% in the week ending March 11, up roughly a full percentage point from a year earlier and the highest level since May 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Higher mortgage rates can increase home buying costs, making it more difficult for some aspiring buyers to afford a home. For example, some buyers may need to increase their monthly payments or aim for a less-expensive home to keep payments at a level they can afford. read more
Increased borrowing costs could weaken demand for homes, but with the inventory of homes for sale at a record low, it could take time before that shift affects home prices, said Domonic Purviance, real estate expert for the Atlanta Fed. Home prices may increase more slowly in the near term, but they are unlikely to decline, said Purviance.

AUTO LOANS
A shortage of cars for sale has sent car prices rising and now higher interest rates could make car loans more expensive. That's because the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed can indirectly affect the rates charged on auto loans. People who already have cars purchased with a fixed-rate loan shouldn't be affected.
As with housing, those increased borrowing costs may deter some people from buying more cars. Comparing rates from multiple lenders may help buyers find a more affordable loan.
SAVING RATES
The Fed's rate hikes could translate into higher yields paid on savings accounts, but that may not happen immediately. Banks may take their time to lift the rates they pay on deposits, especially if they are already swimming in cash.
Eventually, the increase in short-term rates should lead to larger payouts on certificates of deposits and other savings accounts. Online savings accounts typically offer higher yields than savings accounts held with traditional banks. Savers can compare rates offered by various financial institutions online.
CREDIT LINES
Certain types of loans with adjustable interest rates, including home equity lines of credit and credit cards, may show the effects of the Fed's rate moves almost immediately.
The first rate increase of 0.25 percentage point announced on Wednesday may not deal a huge blow to consumers' pockets. But borrowers could feel more strain after a series of rate hikes.
Fed officials project that the central bank's benchmark overnight rate could rise to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% by the end of the year and could go as high as 2.8% by the end of next year. read more
""The cost of that debt is only going to grow over the next couple of years,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, said in a statement.

As the Federal Reserve prepares to kick off a series of interest rate hikes Wednesday, its current policy roadmap will steer the US into stagflation and a major recession , according to former US Secretary of the Treasury, Larry Summers.
In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Summers described Fed Chair Jerome Powell's optimism around taming inflation as wishful thinking.
""I believe the Fed has not internalized the magnitude of its errors over the past year, is operating with an inappropriate and dangerous framework, and needs to take far stronger action to support price stability than appears likely,"" wrote Summers.
While the Federal Reserve must prioritize price stability to sustain employment, Summers said the reality is that real short-term interest rates will have to hit 5% to stave off a recession — and markets currently think this number is ""unimaginable.""
Summers, who is currently the President Emeritus of Harvard University and previously led President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, noted that a recession often follows conditions of high inflation and low unemployment.
The Fed has drawn criticism over the last year for its characterization of inflation as ""transitory."" The central bank backed down from that call as prices surged close to 40-year highs. Economists have slammed the Fed for not pivoting away early enough from its pandemic-era easy money policies.
As recently as two weeks ago, Summers points out, the central bank was still snapping up mortgage-backed securities despite skyrocketing home prices.
Summers added that, during the pandemic, the Fed adopted a new approach of allowing high inflation to stick around for an extended stretch of time — ""this new framework should be abandoned,"" wrote Summers.
""I hope the Fed will make clear that inflation reduction is its principle objective, and that it will wind down efforts to promote worthy but non-monetary goals such as social justice and environmental protection,"" wrote Summers. ""This implies committing to doing whatever is necessary with interest rates to bring down inflation, including movements of more than a quarter-point at some meetings and a rapid reduction of its balance sheet.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/federal-reserve-larry-summers-rate-hike-interest-inflation-economy-treasury-2022-3

This was the first interest rate hike by the Fed since late 2018, and more are on the way.
The median estimate among voting members of the Fed suggest a total of 7 rate hikes in 2022.

US stocks jumped on Wednesday after investors got their first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve since late 2018.
The Fed raised the Fed Funds rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The range previously sat at 0.00% to 0.25% since the Fed cut rates amid the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. And more rate hikes are on the way, according to the Fed's dot plot, which tracks expectations from members of the Fed.
A potential for seven rate hikes could happen in 2022, according to the dot plot, with the Fed funds rate rising to just below the 2.00% level. That would mean an interest rate hike at every Fed meeting in 2022 as Fed chairman Jerome Powell attempts to put a lid on rising inflation.
Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. ET close on Wednesday:
The Fed also said it will start to reduce its multi-trillion dollar balance sheet later this year, and some, including Fed President James Bullard, expect the potential for a 50 basis point rate hike rather than the traditional 25 basis point hike.
""[Bullard] has been the most hawkish member of the Fed for some time and there was likely a lot of sympathy for his position given the economy is growing strongly, is creating jobs in significant number and is experiencing the fastest rate of annual inflation for forty years,"" ING Economics said following the Fed's decision.
But uncertainty surrounding the recent spike in commodity prices and Russia's ongoing attack against Ukraine could ultimately lead to a policy pivot from the Fed if consumers and the economy start to weaken.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Congress on Wednesday, asking the US government for a no-fly zone to protect its airspace from Russian attacks. But he also acknowledged US reluctance to enforce a no-fly zone, which could escalate the conflict between Russia and Western countries.
Chinese stocks like Alibaba and Tencent soared more than 20% on Wednesday after China's Vice Premier Liu He pledged support for policies that would benefit its stock market, and said that talks between the US and China on foreign listings have made progress.
Nickel markets reopened on Wednesday following a massive short-squeeze earlier this month that sent prices to more than $100,000 per ton. Nickel prices fell about 5% before trades were halted once again.
Oil prices entered a bear market earlier this week and are now well below their recent highs sparked by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell as much as much as 1.22% to $95.26 per barrel. Brent crude, oil's international benchmark, fell as much as 1.85% to $98.06.
Bitcoin rose 4.22% to $40,820. Ether prices gained 4.74% to $2,746.
Gold fell as much as 0.45% to $1,921.10 per ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury added 2 basis points to 2.17%.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates-powell-2022-3

Summary Markets expect quarter-percentage-point rate hike
Policy statement, projections due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT)
Fed's Powell scheduled to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will close the door on its ultra-easy pandemic-era monetary policy and step up the fight against stubbornly high inflation with the first in what is likely to be a series of interest rate hikes this year.
The shift, beginning with an expected quarter-percentage-point increase in the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate, has been in the works since last fall and has already driven up the cost of home mortgages and other key types of credit in anticipation of what the Fed will do to curb prices that are rising at their fastest pace in 40 years.

Yet the urgency surrounding the Fed's policy meeting this week has intensified because inflation has shown no signs of easing and may even rise further on the back of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which fueled an oil price spike this month.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
The precise language of the Fed's new policy statement and the details of updatedquarterly economic and interest rate projections will provide the first concrete guidance about how all that has influenced policymakers, and in particular whether it has rattled faith that the current economic expansion can stay on track even as inflation is driven lower.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to lawmakers in Congress earlier this month, said he felt it was ""more likely than not that we can achieve what we call a soft landing ... which is get inflation back under control without a recession.""
But he also acknowledged the central bank was in uncertain terrain, perhaps more reminiscent of the high-inflation days of the 1970s than of the weak inflation environment that has conditioned monetary policy since the early 1990s.
""We haven't faced this challenge in a long time,"" Powell said in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. ""But we all know the history and we all know what we need to do.""
The new projections due to be issued alongside the policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) will show just how aggressive officials think they may need to be, and whether policymakers see the target federal funds rate rising to the sort of restrictive levels that could actually crimp the economy and increase unemployment.
Since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the Fed has penciled in those sorts of restrictive policies only once, in response to former President Donald Trump's run-up of deficit spending in 2017 and 2018, but rates never rose that high before the economy started to buckle.
Reuters Graphics
Inflation is now the motivation. The Fed's preferred gauge of price pressures is currently increasing at an annual rate that is triple the central bank's 2% target, and the environment of war, rising energy costs, and climbing wages has drawn parallels to the 1970s and early 1980s when the Fed pushed the economy into recession to break the cycle.
If the COVID-19 pandemic led to unpredictable economics, developments in Europe have made the situation almost Byzantine when it comes to forecasting.
The price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude , for example, rose about 33% to $123 a barrel in the days following Russia's Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine. On Tuesday, it had fallen back to about $95 a barrel, near where it was before the war.
But that decline was driven largelyby new coronavirus-related lockdowns in China that could cause economic problems of their own - including more inflation.
The situation ""couldn't be worse for the Federal Reserve, which is already chasing inflation for the first time since the 1980s. The disruptions we are seeing are adding fuel to a well kindled inflation fire,"" wrote Diane Swonk, chief economist at GrantThonton.
Powell ""will be walking a tightrope, balancing the need to raise rates and rein in a more systemic rise in inflation with the need to avert a meltdown"" if the central bank is seen raising rates so fast it might risk a recession, she added.
A 'NIMBLE' APPROACH
Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour after the release of the policy statement and projections. In addition to elaborating on the statement, he will likely provide an update on the discussions of when and how fast to reduce the Fed's roughly $8.5 trillion portfolio of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, a second tool for tightening monetary policy that will be deployed later in the year.
Powell has used words like ""nimble"" to describe his approach to a situation in which policymakers may have to adapt on the fly, and in which they have been repeatedly fooled by economic developments from a faster-than-expected recovery to the slow return of workers to jobs.
Reuters Graphics
The language of the new policy statement and the details of the new projections will, however, put the Fed's broader thinking on display.
As of December, most Fed officials felt they could get a grip on inflation with a relatively light touch that involved increasing the target federal funds rate, currently near zero, to just 2.1% by the end of 2024, a level still not considered restrictive by policymakers.
But policymakers at that point also felt inflation for 2022 would be just 2.6% and on its way down as the U.S. and world economies worked through the supply chain issues and other problems created by the pandemic - an outlook that also is proving out of step.
Given the level of inflation, ""the message has to be at least somewhat hawkish,"" wrote Evercore ISI analysts Krishna Guha and Peter Williams, even if the volatile events of recent weeks mean officials will also want to stress ""that now more than ever nothing is set in stone.""

Key Facts
Stocks rose for a second day in a row: The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.3%, over 400 points, while the S&P 500 rose 1.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 2.5%. All eyes will be on the Federal Reserve as it wraps up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday: The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates, by a quarter percentage point, for the first time since 2018. With inflation at 40-year highs and showing no sign of moderating soon, Investors will be looking for clues on the Fed’s rate hiking path, with experts predicting the central bank to raise rates five or six times in 2022. Markets also got a boost from hopes of a possible ceasefire agreement in the Russia-Ukraine war, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying in an address on Tuesday that a deal was beginning to “sound more realistic,” while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed “hope” for an agreement. The heavy fighting in Ukraine has weighed on markets since last month, and while Ukrainian forces have held off attacks on several major cities, the country continues to call for more aid from the West, with Zelenskyy addressing the U.S. Congress on Wednesday morning. Oil prices, which have jumped in recent weeks due to the conflict between two major exporters, at one point surged to a multi-year high of $130 per barrel before moderating somewhat and now sitting at just below $100 per barrel.
Crucial Quote:
“The main focus for Wednesday (by far) will be the Fed… although investors will also be watching for any updates out of the Russia-Ukraine peace talks,” says Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli. “More time is required to achieve an agreement,” he notes, predicting that markets could meanwhile rally on the back of the Fed news today, especially “given the present bearish setup and the fact stocks are oversold.”
What To Watch For:
Investor sentiment has grown increasingly bearish this month, with expectations for global economic growth plunging to their lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, according to a recent Bank of America fund manager survey. Over half of those surveyed now predict that stocks will fall into a bear market this year and the U.S. economy will be plagued by stagflation—meaning high inflation and slow economic growth.

History shows the S&P 500 can climb following multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve , LPL Financial said Wednesday as investors prepared for the US central bank to start raising rates for the first time since 2018.
The Fed on Wednesday was set to start ramping up interest rates from the ultralow range of 0%-0.25% where it was cut in 2020 as policymakers responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The S&P 500 has suffered this year in part as investors anticipate the Fed will issue a string of rate increases to combat inflation that's jumped to a 40-year high of 7.9% as of February. The S&P 500 was down about 9% through Tuesday's session, with all but the energy sector in the red, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to rocking US stocks and other global equities lower.
The central bank led by Jerome Powell was widely expected to lift off with 25 basis points, or 0.25%, with markets pointing to the possibility of three to four more moves in 2022.
While borrowing costs will become more expensive, the S&P 500 equity benchmark can manage to advance under such conditions, LPL Financial said as a reminder in a note.
The ""Fed rarely kicks off a new cycle of hikes with a 50 basis point hike. It is later in the cycle that tends see 50 basis point hikes or larger,"" said Ryan Detrick, LPL's chief market strategist, adding that stocks ""tend to do just fine"" during periods of multiple rate increases.
""The mid-2000s cycle is what has our attention, as there were 17 total rate hikes in 2004, 2005, and 2006, yet the S&P 500 managed to gain in every year,"" he said.
In that two-year cycle, the fed funds rate went up from 1% to 5.25%. The S&P's annualized return was 5.6% during the period.
""Investors need to remember that Fed rate hikes usually happen near the middle of the economic cycle, with potentially years left of gains in stocks and the economy,"" said Detrick. ""In fact, a year after the first hike in a cycle has been fairly strong, higher a year later the past six times.""
One of LPL's charts showed the S&P 500 was up 9.1% a year after the Fed in December 2015 increased rates by 0.25% under then-Chair Janet Yellen, To achieve that, the index had to overcome a loss of 1.1% in the three months after liftoff.
The chart's largest advance of 39.6% took place a year after the March 1997 rate hike of 0.25%. But the equity benchmark dropped by 11.7% in the 12 months after a quarter-percentage point increase in April 1987. The Black Monday stock crash unexpectedly took place in October 1987.
When the Fed raised rates by a hefty 0.5% in August 1983, the S&P 500 returned 2.1% a year later.
""The bottom line is rate hikes usually aren't bearish events and we don't expect this cycle to be any different,"" said Detrick.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-rate-hikes-stock-market-outlook-inflation-economy-sp500-2022-3

The record-low interest rates seen throughout the coronavirus crisis are no longer.
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, ending a two-year period of near-zero rates and taking its biggest step yet toward cooling inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee lifted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points, matching forecasts broadly held by economists for weeks. The move kicks off a cycle of rate increases expected to last throughout the rest of the year at the very least.
""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run,"" the Fed said in a statement. ""In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.25% to 0.5% and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.""
The Wednesday hike will reverberate throughout the economy in the coming weeks. Lenders' rates are directly influenced by the Fed's benchmark, and when the central bank raises its own rate, borrowing costs around the country edge higher. That means all forms of borrowing from car loans to credit card interest payments are poised to get slightly more expensive.
The rate increase officially reverses one of the Fed's main policy supports used to aid the virus-slammed economy. The central bank pulled rates close to zero in March 2020 as the coronavirus's spread sparked widespread lockdowns and froze economic activity across the country. The historically low rates helped people and businesses borrow cash at low costs, giving Americans a major support as the country slid into the deepest recession in nearly a century.
But while cheap cash offered a bridge for struggling households, it also played a role in allowing inflation to hit the fastest pace in four decades. Low borrowing costs encouraged spending and helped demand rebound throughout 2021. Spending boomed, but supply struggled to keep up. The gap between the two led businesses to raise prices at a faster pace, kickstarting the inflation problem the country faces today.
The benchmark interest rate serves as the Fed's top tool for cooling the economy and pulling inflation lower. By raising rates, the Fed can dampen demand and, in turn, close the imbalance that fuels inflation.
Whether the Fed timed its rate decision correctly remains to be seen. Many economists have blamed the central bank for allowing inflation to hit historic highs, arguing policymakers moved too late to slow the price surge. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has been among the Fed's biggest critics in recent months. Summers has repeatedly slammed the Fed for the inflation problem and, in a Tuesday column in The Washington Post, said the late rate hike risks persistently high inflation and a new economic downturn.
""The Fed's current policy trajectory is likely to lead to stagflation, with average unemployment and inflation both averaging over 5 percent over the next few years — and ultimately to a major recession,"" he said.
Projections published by the Fed on Wednesday signal they're rushing to put more downward pressure on inflation. Median estimates show most officials expecting at least six more rate hikes in 2022 and additional increases the following year. The FOMC also indicated it will start reducing its holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities ""at a coming meeting,"" a move that will further tighten monetary conditions and counter inflation.
Powell indicated in a Wednesday press conference that the Fed still expects inflation to start cooling in the second half of 2022. Yet the Fed's updated projections see inflation holding at higher levels through the year and easing much more slowly than officials expected in December.
The central bank probably should've started raising rates six months ago, especially considering the new upside risks to inflation, Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said.
""With inflation already almost quadruple their target, the Fed is playing catch-up and clearly recognizes the need to get back in front of the inflation situation,"" she added.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rates-inflation-higher-costs-loans-mortgages-2022-3

March 16 (Reuters) - A key Senate panel late Wednesday gave its stamp of approval to President Joe Biden's renomination of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and two other nominees to the Fed Board, but it was deadlocked on a fourth nominee.
Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, in remarks ahead of the vote, lauded Powell for his leadership of the Fed through the coronavirus pandemic and for his defense of the central bank's independence when Powell came under fire from Republican former President Donald Trump. Powell ""has earned the opportunity to lead the Fed as chair,"" Brown, a Democrat, said.
The vote came just a few hours after Powell led the Fed in what is expected to be the first of a series of interest rate hikes this year to fight soaring inflation. read more

The panel also approved the promotion of Fed Governor Lael Brainard to Fed vice chair and the nomination of Philip Jefferson, an economist and the dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina. Their names, along with Powell's, are now sent to the full Senate, which will have the final say on their confirmation.
But Republicans on the panel refused to endorse Lisa Cook, an economics professor at Michigan State University, whom Biden picked to be the first Black female Fed governor.
A tie vote does not end a nomination, but it complicates and potentially delays it in a 50-50 Senate that Democrats control only by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking position.
If Republicans in the full Senate are united in opposition, as they were against Cook at the Senate banking panel, she will need the backing of every member of Biden's party to gain confirmation.
On Tuesday, Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew as Biden's nominee to become the top bank regulator at the Fed because she did not have that.

An analysis of 12 rate hike cycles overall by Truist Advisory Services found the S&P 500's posted a total return at an average annualized rate of 9.4% during the length of such cycles, showing positive returns in 11 of those periods.
""Equities have generally risen during periods where the Fed funds rate is rising because this is normally paired with a healthy economy and rising profits,"" Keith Lerner, Truist's co-chief investment officer, wrote in a report.

Many investors worry that this year may be more complicated than most, however, as markets are faced with soaring inflation which stands to be worsened by surging commodity prices in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine.
The uncertainty has presented a dilemma for the central bank, with some investors worried policymakers could push the economy into a recession if it raises rates too far as it seeks to tamp down inflation.
To be sure, rate increases have tended to weigh on stocks in the near-term. An analysis by Evercore ISI of four hiking cycles found that the S&P 500 fell an average of 4% in the first month following the start of the cycle.
But the benchmark index was higher six months into the cycle by an average of 3%, and 5% higher on average after 12 months, according to Evercore.
""The Fed doesn't want a recession and it generally takes a whole lot of hiking before the economy is put into position to potentially feel a recession,"" said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI.
Emanuel said Evercore's ""base case"" is that the market is ""really in the midst of making a near-term bottom that is more likely to deliver the kind of six- and 12-month returns that a typical Fed rate hike cycle has engendered previously.""

However, with the Fed starting to tighten monetary policy after offering massive support to help the economy endure the coronavirus pandemic, some investors are prepared for potential rockiness.
The S&P 500 has slid more than 10% to start 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) confirmed it was in a bear market, dropping over 20% from its November all-time high. Tech and growth stocks have underperformed, as the rise in bond yields pressures the value of future cash flows that those stocks valuations' rely on.
Six month performance of RLV vs RLG
Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said that if the Fed ""is successful in orchestrating a soft landing"" for the economy as it raises rates this year, it could lead to much higher bond yields, that ""would simply weigh on equity valuations.""
""The bottom line is the Fed is going to start removing the punch bowl this week,"" Wilson said in a note this week.
""The question for equity investors is how far can they get on rate hikes given the already slowing growth and additional shock from the war?""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that peace talks were sounding more realistic but more time was needed, even as Russian air strikes continued and the refugee tally from Moscow's invasion reached 3 million.
The rise in Asian shares came a day after mainland and Hong Kong equity indexes had tumbled in reaction to spiking coronavirus infections in China and fading expectations for a rate cut by the People's Bank of China. Investor sentiment remained weak, however. And the strong early rebound in China's CSI300 index had evaporated by late morning on Wednesday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index also trimmed gains.
The Hang Seng was last up 1.7% after opening 3.6% higher, while the CSI300 was down 0.6% from a rise of nearly 1.9% earlier. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8%.
Australian shares were up 0.9%, and Seoul's Kospi added 0.7%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 1.7%. ""People are concerned that (Chinese) policymakers would believe that the economy is doing much better and growth is rebounding and there's no need for further policy easing measures,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
""I think a small rate cut is not a big deal anyway, but people are concerned about for example zero-COVID strategy, people are concerned about the property market and ... other policies."" China has seen increasing positive changes in its economic performance backed up by surprisingly good economic data, but the impact of the latest COVID-19 resurgence need to be watched, China's statistics bureau spokesman said on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, Chinese health authorities reported a slight drop in new cases compared to a day earlier, although major Chinese cities continue to grapple with controlling the spread of the virus. The gains in Asia followed a relief rally overnight on Wall Street driven by hopes of a resolution in Ukraine. The S&P 500 gained 2.14%, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.92% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.82%.
EYES ON FED Analysts at ING said in a note that market moves in Asia would be ""cautious"" ahead of the Fed meeting later in the global day.
Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates by at least 25 basis points amid surging prices. Traders will also be closely watching the Fed for details on how it plans to end its bond-buying program. U.S. bond yields fell in Asian trade, with the benchmark 10-year note yield at 2.1384%, after earlier rising to 2.169%, the highest since June 2019.
The two-year yield was last at 1.8408% from a close of 1.857%. The U.S. dollar was down slightly against a basket of peers, trading at 98.892, and lower against the yen at 118.22 albeit still near a five-year high. The euro edged up 0.12% to $1.0964.
Oil prices, which had traded lower early in the session, turned higher, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine continuing to stoke volatile trade. Global benchmark Brent crude rose 1.26% to $101.17 per barrel, and U.S. crude added 0.93% to $97.34 per barrel.
Highlighting the impact of global disruptions and soaring oil costs, Japan reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit in February as an energy-driven surge in import costs caused by massive supply constraints added to vulnerabilities for the world's third-largest economy.

NEW YORK, USA – The three main Wall Street stock indexes rallied on Tuesday, March 15, a day before an expected interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, while oil prices dropped 7% on hopes of an end to the conflict in Ukraine.
Investors are expecting the US central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in three years by at least 25 basis points amid surging prices. Traders will also be closely watching the Fed for details on how it plans to end its bond-buying program.
Ahead of the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, March 16, the benchmark 10-year note yields eased from more than two-year highs and were last at 2.1544%, after earlier rising to 2.169%, the highest since June 2019.
“I think the big event this week is going to be Fed discussing what they’re going to do with the portfolio and how fast they’re going to move. The expectation in the short term of course is going to be the raising of the rates by a quarter of a percent,” said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund in Wisconsin.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500, which had slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions, rallied, driven by technology, consumer discretionary, and healthcare sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.82% to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 gained 2.14% to 4,262.45, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.92% to 12,948.62.
“What you’re seeing is relief rallies on a bear market. There’s hopes and expectations that something will start resolving in Ukraine,” Plumb added.
European stocks, which had been rebounding in recent sessions, dipped after China reported a jump in coronavirus cases and new restrictions. The ongoing war in Ukraine also weighed on European shares despite continuing ceasefire talks and some positive signs of a breakthrough.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.28% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had closed 2.73% lower overnight.
Oil prices tumbled more than 6% to their lowest in almost three weeks on Tuesday as supply disruption fears eased on Ukraine peace hopes and surging COVID-19 cases in China spurred demand concerns.
Brent futures plummeted 6.5% to settle at $99.91 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude fell 6.4% to settle at $96.44 a barrel. Both contracts settled below $100 per barrel for the first time since late February.
The US dollar lost value to the euro and other major currencies after oil prices fell and ahead of the Fed’s expected rate hike. The dollar index fell 0.043%, with the euro up 0.04% to $1.0943.
Safe-haven gold fell nearly more than 1% to a two-week trough. Spot gold dropped 1.8% to $1,915.48 an ounce, while US gold futures fell 1.55% to $1,929.30 an ounce. – Rappler.com",https://www.rappler.com/business/updates-global-stock-markets-oil-prices-march-15-2022/
