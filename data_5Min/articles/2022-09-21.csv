0,Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points for third time this year,2022-09-21T17:15:44Z,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted interest rates by three-fourths of a percentage point, the latest in a series of aggressive steps to tame stubborn inflation.","(The Hill) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted interest rates by three-fourths of a percentage point, the latest in a series of aggressive steps to tame stubborn inflation.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — the panel of Fed officials responsible for monetary policy— hiked its baseline interest rate by 0.75 percentage points Wednesday to a span of 3 to 3.25 percent.
It is the fifth Fed rate hike since March and the third consecutive FOMC meeting ending with a 75 basis point hike.
The Fed had long been expected to issue another 75 basis point hike in September as inflation continued to rise through much of the summer and linger near four-decade highs. While monthly price growth has slowed slightly, the annual inflation rate of 8.2 percent in August, according to the consumer price index, was close to levels not seen since the late 1970s.
Fed officials had faced some pressure to hike by a full percentage point in the weeks leading up to the Wednesday meeting after consumer prices rose again in August. Financial markets locked in a roughly 20 percent change of a 1 percentage point rate hike in the hours before the FOMC meeting concluded Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which tracks where traders expect the Fed to set interest rates.
Even so, the Fed stuck to its plan for a 0.75 percentage point hike, a move bank officials portrayed as an urgent but measured attempt to smother inflation.
“Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures,” the FOMC said in a statement.
The Fed has hiked interest rates rapidly from near-zero levels set in 2020 as the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy. The bank is racing to bring inflation down before it spirals out of control by slowing the economy enough to reduce the amount of spending on goods and services.
Fed officials and many economists were hopeful that the bank could slow the economy and make a dent on inflation without derailing strong job growth, low unemployment and steady economic growth. But experts say the chances of recession in 2024 are rising.
“The Fed is in a really, really tough position, in part because they have a very limited toolkit,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director at Groundwork Collaborative.
“They have inflation that’s coming from a constellation of sources,” Owens explained.
The Fed’s rate hikes have slowed the housing market, curbed some hiring and weighed on economic growth. The combination of the Fed’s actions, normalizing supply chains and falling gas prices should eventually lead to lower inflation.
But inflation has fallen little since the Fed’s rate hikes began and officials have pledged to keep ramping up rates until they see clear signs of slowing price growth — a process Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged would bring “pain.”
“We’re seeing the expected consequences of this,” Owens said. “It’s working, but it is not truly taming the price increases we’re seeing.”

1,Peso sinks to new all-time low of 58 against US dollar,2022-09-21T16:00:00Z,The peso settled at a new all-time low of 58 against the US dollar Wednesday as investors closely watch the expected new interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.,"The peso settled at a new all-time low of 58 against the US dollar Wednesday as investors closely watch the expected new interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
The peso shed P0.52 to close at 58 against the greenback Wednesday, down from 57.48 Tuesday. Total trade volume reached $1.051 billion, up from $967 million a day earlier.
Reports overseas said the Federal Open Market Committee headed by Jerome Powell might announce a 75-basis-point interest rate hike, with many economists not ruling out a 100-bps increase.
The Fed earlier increased interest rates by 75 bps, saying it was committed to rein in inflation at 2 percent.
Michael Ricafort, chief economist of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said the 58 intraday level of the peso was also the new intraday record low.

“This could lead to higher import prices and overall inflation, as well as could lead to more aggressive local policy rate hike especially on Sept. 22, 2022 to help stabilize the peso, inflation and inflation expectations,” Ricafort said.
“This is the 8th record-high closing rate for the US dollar/peso exchange rate since the start of 2022,” he said.
Ricafort said the peso also weakened after global crude oil prices corrected slightly higher, but still near eight-month lows.
He said the peso already depreciated by a total of P7.001 or 13.7 percent from 50.999 in end-2021.
“For tomorrow, the peso exchange rate could range [at] 57.85 to 58.05 levels,” Ricafort said.
Robert Dan Roces, chief economist of Security Bank, said the continued peso weakness was due to “US dollar strength and positioning still ahead of the Fed and BSP meetings.” The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas would hold its policy meeting Thursday.
Roces said the BSP “should opt for a stronger message by way of clearer forward guidance beyond the actions tomorrow. Inflation is an upside risk with weaker peso.”
Moody’s Investor Service, a unit of debt watcher Moody’s Corp., said the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas might announce a 50-bps rate hike Thursday that would bring the overnight borrowing rate to 4.25 percent.
Ricafort earlier said the peso also weakened after the World Bank warned that the global economy might face a recession in 2022 on aggressive monetary policy tightening or interest rate hikes that could still be not enough to bring down elevated inflation.
He said the World Bank noted the “most synchronized rolling back of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures by central banks around the world in about 50 years.”
“The peso also weakened amid some POGO [Philippine offshore gaming operations]-related policy uncertainties, especially those allegedly involved in illegal activities may have also added to some market concerns as this could reduce POGO revenues and also reduce other business activities in the country,” Ricafort said.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve Operating Commission will announce its latest monetary policy decision tonight at 20:00 CEST, with market expectations set for a 75bp interest rate hike, which would lead to the new interest rate range from 2.25% -2.50% to the new 3% -3.25%.
According to the futures on fed funds measured by Investing.com’s fed rate monitor, the probability of a maximum increase of a full percentage point stands at 15%, while +75bps are expected to be 85%
With the ‘jumbo’ rise practically discounted, investors will also pay attention to the likely very hawkish tones in the press release and Governor Powell’s next press conference, and will also keep an eye on the new economic projections and dotplot chart.
“We believe that the decision to raise the cost of money by 75 basis points is consistent with the macroeconomic data published”, writes Filippo Diodovich, Senior Market Strategist of IG Italia, in a note, as consumer inflation expectations “have decreased significantly. “despite an increase beyond expectations in August (+ 8.3% y / y).
According to the strategist, “there is therefore no reason to overreact, taking into account that the effects on the real economy of central bank decisions can be seen after many quarters, but on the financial markets the impact is immediate and a disproportionate choice. compared to the trend of macro data could lead to a certain financial instability “.
However, the decision to raise by 75 basis points does not diminish the Fed’s commitment to tackle inflationary pressures. IG believes, in fact, that the tones used by Powell at the press conference “will be very hawkish”, while in the economic projections the Fed economists “will revise down the estimates on real growth and will instead make an upward revision on the outlook for inflation”.
As regards the expectations on policymakers ‘rates, the so-called dotplots, according to Diodovich, bankers’ expectations at the end of the year “will have totally changed”.
“In June the median of central bankers expected a level of the cost of money at the end of 2022 in the range 3.25% -3.50%. We believe that the median will rise in the range 4% -4.25% which would imply an increase of another 100 basis points between the November and December meetings “, says the expert.
Impact on the market
According to IG, in the very short term equity markets could “also react positively for having avoided the danger of a monstrous 100 basis point hike”.
However, the manager maintains the outlook “bearish on indices and bullish on the dollar in the medium / short term in the belief that the Fed will continue to engage in aggressively tackling inflation with rates above 4% at the end of the year”.",https://sparkchronicles.com/the-cost-of-the-dollar-will-exceed-4-at-year-end-by-investing-com/

12,Another Rate Hike is Coming. Federal Reserve Expected to Raise Rates by at Least 75 Basis Points Today,2022-09-21T14:35:19Z,This will mark the fifth time the Fed has raised the federal funds rate.,"This story is part of Recession Help Desk, CNET's coverage of how to make smart money moves in an uncertain economy.
What's happening In an effort to quell stubborn inflation, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates today. Why it matters If the Fed continues to drive up interest rates, there will be consequences -- most likely an uptick in unemployment, and an increase in interest rates for mortgages, credit cards and loans. What it means for you Soaring consumer prices, tumbling stocks, increased costs to borrow money and the threat of layoffs could prove particularly devastating for low- and middle-income Americans.
Hopes that the Federal Reserve would ease up on rate hikes this month were extinguished with August inflation data. Today, the Fed is expected to raise rates for the fifth time this year, in an effort to curtail runaway inflation.
Despite slightly cooling year over year, inflation rose by 0.1% from July to August, with food and shelter prices continuing to climb. But thanks to decreasing energy prices, including gas, inflation dipped 8.3% year over year, down from June's record high 9.1% reading, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report.
The Fed is expected to raise rates by another 75 basis points, according to a Reuters poll of economists, after it wraps up its two-day meeting tomorrow.
""We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measures necessary to return inflation to our 2% longer run goal,"" Powell said during July's press conference. ""This process is likely to involve a period of below-trend economic growth, and some softening in labor market conditions. But such outcomes are likely necessary to restore price stability and to set the stage for maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.""
Raising interest rates is the main action the Fed can take to try to counter high inflation. When it costs more to borrow -- as with credit cards, mortgages and other loans -- consumers have less spending power and will buy fewer items, decreasing the ""demand"" side of the supply-demand equation, theoretically helping to lower prices.
Many worry that further increases to the cost of borrowing money could contract the economy too much, sending us into a recession: a shrinking, rather than growing, economy. The Fed acknowledges the adverse effects of this restrictive monetary policy.
Here's everything you need to know about what's causing this record high inflation and how the Fed hopes to bring levels back down.
What's happening with inflation?
In August, inflation increased to 8.3% over the previous year, though it has declined slightly from July's 8.5% reading and June's record high 9.1% yearly increase, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Gas prices declined significantly by 10.6% in August -- marking a two-month trend -- but that was offset by increasing prices of food and shelter.
During periods of high inflation, your dollar has less purchasing power, making everything you buy more expensive, even though you're likely not getting paid more. In fact, more Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and wages aren't keeping up with inflation rates.
Why is inflation so high right now?
In short, a lot of this can be attributed to the pandemic. In March 2020, the onset of COVID-19 caused the US economy to shut down. Millions of employees were laid off, many businesses had to close their doors and the global supply chain was abruptly put on pause. This caused the flow of goods produced and manufactured abroad and shipped to the US to cease for at least two weeks, and in many cases, for months, according to Pete Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research.
But the reduction in supply was met with increased demand as Americans started purchasing durable goods to replace the services they used prior to the pandemic, said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. ""The pandemic put distortions on both the demand and supply side of the US economy,"" Bivens said.
Though the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on the US economy are easing, labor disruptions and supply-and-demand imbalances persist, including shortages in microchips, steel, equipment and other goods, causing ongoing slowdowns in manufacturing and construction. Unanticipated shocks to the global economy have made things worse -- particularly subsequent COVID-19 variants, lockdowns in China (which restrict the availability of goods in the US) and the war in Ukraine (which is affecting gas and food prices), according to the World Bank.
Powell confirmed the World Bank's findings at the Fed's June meeting, calling these external factors challenging because they are outside of the central bank's control.
Some lawmakers have also accused corporations of seizing on inflation as an excuse to increase prices more than necessary, a form of price gouging.
Why is the Federal Reserve raising rates?
With inflation hitting record highs, the Fed is under a great deal of pressure from policymakers and consumers to get the situation under control. One of the Fed's primary objectives is to promote price stability and maintain inflation at a rate of 2%.
By raising interest rates, the Fed aims to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive. In turn, consumers, investors and businesses pause on making investments and purchases with credit, which leads to reduced economic demand, theoretically reeling in prices and balancing the scales of supply and demand.
The Fed raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March, followed by a half of a percentage point in May and three-quarters of a percentage point in mid-June. In July, the Fed raised rates by another three-quarters of a percentage point. This week, it's expected to raise rates again.
The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other for borrowing and lending. And there's a trickle-down effect: When it costs banks more to borrow from one another, they offset it by raising rates on their consumer loan products. That's how the Fed effectively drives up interest rates in the US economy.
The federal funds rate now sits at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. But the Fed thinks this needs to go up significantly to see progress on inflation, likely into the 3.5% to 4% range, according to Powell. The Fed's latest estimate is that, by the end of this year, the federal funds rate will sit at a range of 3.25% to 3.50%.
However, hiking interest rates can only reduce inflationary pressures so much, especially when the current factors are largely on the supply side -- and are worldwide. A growing number of economists say that the situation is more complicated to get under control, and that the Fed's monetary policy alone is not enough.
Could rising interest rates spark a recession?
We can't yet determine how these policy moves will broadly affect prices and wages. But with more rate hikes projected this year, there's concern that the Fed will overreact by raising rates too aggressively, which could spark a more painful economic downturn or create a recession.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, which hasn't yet officially determined if the US is in a recession, defines a recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months."" That means a declining gross domestic product, or GDP, alongside diminishing production and retail sales, as well as shrinking incomes and lower employment.
Pushing up rates too quickly might reduce consumer demand too much and unduly stifle economic growth, leading businesses to lay off workers or stop hiring. That would drive up unemployment, leading to another problem for the Fed, as it's also tasked with maintaining maximum employment.
In a general sense, inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship. When more people are working, they have the means to spend, leading to an increase in demand and elevated prices. However, when inflation is low, joblessness tends to be higher. But with prices remaining sky-high, many investors are increasingly worried about a coming period of stagflation -- the toxic combination of slow economic growth with high unemployment and inflation.
Here's what higher interest rates mean for you
For the past two years, interest rates had been at historic lows, partially because the Fed slashed rates in 2020 to keep the US economy afloat in the face of lockdowns. The Fed kept interest rates near zero, a move made only once before, during the financial crisis of 2008.
For the average consumer, increased interest rates means buying a car or a home will get more expensive, since you'll pay more in interest. Higher rates could make it more expensive to refinance your mortgage or student loans. Moreover, the Fed hikes will drive up interest rates on credit cards, meaning that your debt on outstanding balances will go up.
Securities and crypto markets could also be negatively impacted by the Fed's decisions to raise rates. When interest rates go up, money is more expensive to borrow, leading to less liquidity in both the crypto and stock markets. Investor psychology can also cause markets to slide, as cautious investors may move their money out of stocks or crypto into more conservative investments, such as government bonds.
On the flip side, rising interest rates could mean a slightly better return on your savings accounts. Interest rates on savings deposits are directly affected by the federal funds rate. Several banks have already increased annual percentage yields, or APYs, on their savings accounts and certificates of deposit in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes.

13,The Fed Just Made a ‘Jumbo’ Interest Rate Hike of 0.75%,2022-09-21T14:04:23Z,"The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by 0.75%, increasing the cost of debt for credit cards, auto financing and other loans.","To reduce persistently high inflation, the Federal Reserve announced a third consecutive ""jumbo"" interest hike of 0.75% Wednesday, further increasing the cost of debt for credit cards, vehicle financing and other loans.
The fifth-straight increase to the federal funds rate brings it to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest it's been since 2008. Typically, rate increases come in 0.25% increments, but the Fed has been using supersized hikes to curb the rate of inflation, which is currently up 8.3% year over year — well above its benchmark target of 2%.
By increasing its key interest rate, the central bank discourages spending, which can reduce inflation for the prices for goods and services. However, the downside to each rate hike is increased monthly debt costs for Americans.
Here are four things that will likely get more expensive.

1. Credit cards
Fed rate hikes affect your credit card's annual percentage rate (APR), which determines how much interest you pay for any outstanding debt not paid off by the end of the month.
When the rate hikes began in early 2022, average APRs were close to 16% and have since climbed to just over 18%. With today's increase, the average credit card APR could reach closer to 19%, according to financial services site Bankrate.com.
In that case, for a credit card balance of $5,000 with an APR of 19%, you'd pay an additional $1,197 in interest costs compared to an APR of 16%, if you only made the minimum payment each month.
2. Auto financing
Federal funds rate hikes don't affect fixed-rate car loans already in place. However, they do increase interest costs for new auto loans, or those with variable-rate financing.
At the start of 2022, the average interest rate on a 60-month new car loan was 3.85%. But with today's increase, the interest rate could nudge up closer to 5.5% to 5.75%, says Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride. That works out to about an extra $31 per month in auto financing payments, for a $35,000 new car.
3. Mortgages
If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, rising interest rates will have no impact on your loan. However, if you get a new mortgage or have a variable-rate mortgage, your monthly payments could increase.
Mortgage rates tend to rise with rate hikes, but they are more directly influenced by the bond market. Since early 2022, mortgage rates have climbed from 3% to over 6%, increasing the monthly costs on a 30-year fixed-rate $400,000 mortgage with a 20% down payment by a whopping $569.
The one silver lining is that today's widely anticipated rate increase might already be baked into current mortgage rates, meaning they might not climb much further based on today's announcement. Mortgage rate forecasts for the remainder of the year are a mixed bag, with many suggesting that rates will level off.
4. Other variable-rate loans
Expect increased costs for variable-rate loans like personal loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).
In early 2022, HELOC interest rates were averaging more than 4%, but that rate has since climbed to 6.51%, per Bankrate.com. With the rate hike, the average rate could increase to something closer to 7.25%, says McBride.
Home equity loans were 5.96% at the beginning of the year, and are now at about 7.01%, but they could nudge up closer to 8% with today's interest hike, says McBride.
How much you'll pay vary widely based on your lender, the size of the loan and your credit score.

Everything from mortgages and credit cards to student and car loans will be impacted by another major rate hike.
Here’s what it could mean for your monthly expenses.
The Federal Reserve raised the target federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row, in an effort to cool down unrelenting inflation.
Fed officials have raised the benchmark short-term borrowing rate a total of five times this year, including 75-basis point increases in June and July, marking an unprecedented pace.

""The Fed has been delivering a 'tough love' message that interest rates will be higher, and for longer, than expected,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

How persistent high inflation may affect your tax bracket
These steps can help you tackle stressful credit card debt
What the federal funds rate means to you
The federal funds rate, which is set by the U.S. central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and saving rates they see every day.
This rate hike will correspond with a rise in the prime rate and immediately send financing costs higher for many forms of consumer borrowing. ""You are peddling into a progressively stiffer headwind as interest rates rise,"" McBride said.
""Credit card rates are the highest since 1996, mortgage rates are the highest since 2008, and auto loans are the highest since 2012.""
On the flip side, higher interest rates also mean savers will earn more money on their deposits and, already, ""high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit are at levels last seen in 2009,"" McBride noted.
What borrowers should know about higher rates
• Your credit card rate will rise. Since most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. As the federal funds rate rises, the prime rate does, as well, and your credit card rate follows suit within one or two billing cycles.
That means anyone who carries a balance on their credit card will soon have to shell out even more just to cover the interest charges.
Because of this rate hike, consumers with credit card debt will spend an additional $5.3 billion on interest, according to an analysis by WalletHub. Factoring in the rate hikes from from March, May, June, July and September, credit card users will wind up paying around $20.9 billion more in 2022 than they would have otherwise, WalletHub found.
As rates rise, the best thing you can do is pay down high-cost debt — ""2022 has been a pretty brutal year for folks with credit card debt, and unfortunately it is likely to get worse before it gets better,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.
""A 0% balance transfer credit card may be your best weapon in the battle against credit card debt and rising interest rates,"" he advised.
Otherwise, consolidate and pay off high-interest credit cards with a lower-interest home equity loan or personal loan, Schulz said.
""You won't get the 0% rate that you might find with a credit card, but a personal loan can be a good option for refinancing and consolidating loans as rates continue to climb.""
• Mortgage rates are already higher. Adjustable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit are also pegged to the prime rate, but 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the economy. As a result, ""today's rates are at their highest levels since the Great Recession,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.
Along with the central bank's vow to stay tough on inflation, the average interest rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 6%, nearly double what it was at the end of 2021.
On a $300,000 loan, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at December's rate of 3.11% would have meant a monthly payment of about $1,283. Today's rate of 6.02% brings the monthly payment to $1,803. That's an extra $520 a month or $6,240 more a year, and $187,200 more over the lifetime of the loan, according to LendingTree.
If you are house shopping, ""you shouldn't worry too much about whether or not rates could eventually come down,"" Channel advised.
If rates do fall over the coming years, you may get an opportunity to refinance, he noted. ""In other words, you shouldn't feel like you'll be locked into today's rates forever if you decide to buy a home in the near future.""
• Auto loans are more expensive. Even though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because the price for all cars is rising along with the interest rates on new loans, so if you are planning to buy a car, you'll shell out more in the months ahead.
The Fed's latest move could push up the average interest rate on a new car loan past 6%, although consumers with higher credit scores may be able to secure better loan terms.
Paying an annual percentage rate of 6% instead of 5% would cost consumers $1,348 more in interest over the course of a $40,000, 72-month car loan, according to data from Edmunds.
""Auto purchases are large-ticket items where interest rates matter,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director of insights. ""They can make or break a deal, and rapidly rising interest rates could easily push many consumers past their comfort zone for monthly payments.""
• Student loans vary by type. Federal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers won't be impacted immediately by a rate hike. But if you are about to borrow money for college, the interest rate on federal student loans taken out for the 2022-2023 academic year already rose to 4.99%, up from 3.73% last year and 2.75% in 2020-2021.
If you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark.
Currently, average private student loan fixed rates can range from 3.22% to 13.95% and 1.29% to 12.99% for variable rates, according to Bankrate. As with auto loans, they also vary widely based on your credit score.
Of course, anyone with existing education debt should check whether they are eligible for federal student loan forgiveness.
What savers should know about higher rates
• Savers have to shop around to benefit. The good news is that the interest rates on savings accounts are finally higher after several consecutive rate hikes.
While the Fed has no direct influence on deposit rates, they tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate, and the savings account rates at some of the largest retail banks, which have been near rock bottom during most of the Covid pandemic, are currently up to 0.13%, on average.
Thanks, in part, to lower overhead expenses, top-yielding online savings account rates are as high as 2.5%, much higher than the average rate from a traditional, brick-and-mortar bank.
As the central bank continues its rate-hiking cycle, these yields will continue to rise, as well. However, they may not increase as much as you would expect, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com.
""Many banks are still flush with deposits and aren't aggressively raising deposit rates,"" Tumin said. In fact, savings account rates today are lower than they were in early 2019 when the federal funds rate was the same, he noted.
Still, because the inflation rate is now higher than all of these rates, any money in savings loses purchasing power over time.
""Know your dollar will not pay for as much as it did before,"" said Natalia Brown, the chief client operations officer at National Debt Relief.
""If you are already having trouble keeping your head above water, it's an opportunity to reassess your finances,"" Brown said. But ""before taking any additional credit, seek help,"" she added.

15,Why the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates,2022-09-21T14:00:11Z,The current rate-tightening cycle is far from over.,"The current rate-tightening cycle is far from over.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting body, will again raise rates aggressively, almost certainly by 75 basis points. Equally important, in its statement accompanying the rate-setting decision on Wednesday afternoon, the FOMC will likely signal that it will hike by an additional 75 basis points at its early November meeting, just a handful of days before the midterm elections.
The FOMC statement accompanying the rate hiking decision will contain few changes from the statement made in July when the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points. In July, the Fed said consumption and production ""have softened"" but that employment is robust and resilient. This time, the FOMC is likely to state explicitly that ""inflation remains elevated.""
Critics of the Fed’s policy of continuing to raise rates aggressively note that headline inflation has peaked. These critics fret that aggressive Fed action raises significantly the risk of a deep recession where unemployment would rise substantially. But the Fed’s critics, economists identified with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, are silent about the sticky components of inflation: wage inflation, up over 6% , shelter inflation, which the Dallas Fed said it sees peaking in the late spring, and services inflation, which the Dallas Fed said will continue to put upward pressure on overall inflation. The Dallas Fed explained that the tight labor market exerts upward pressure on demand for services, which tend to be labor-intensive. Finally, on the sticky components of inflation, the Dallas Fed said healthcare inflation is only now emerging. It noted that the pace of wage increases for healthcare workers is rising above 2%. The Dallas Fed said wage growth among hospital workers leads to PCE hospital services inflation and PCE healthcare inflation ""by about one year."" The Dallas Fed further explained that healthcare inflation has a “disproportionate impact on PCE inflation,” the Fed’s preferred inflation metric.
It should be clear that Larry Summers and Jason Furman, two economists associated with the Democratic Party, are correct : The Fed must keep raising rates aggressively. Inflation is far from defeated . Summers went so far as to say that the Fed must keep raising rates until the Fed funds rate is above core inflation, which is running somewhere around 4.5-5%. And he opined that Fed policy must push the unemployment rate from its current very low level of 3.7% to over 5%. Such an increase would inflict pain on the economy.
In order to maintain its inflation-fighting credibility, the Fed must continue to raise rates, probably by another 250 basis points: 75 basis points this afternoon, another 75 in November, and an additional 100 basis points at the post-November Fed meetings. Hard economic times are coming, especially for the rate-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and for low-skill workers in the labor-intensive services sector.
High inflation distorts not only consumer behavior but also business behavior . Economic distortions cause productivity-sapping behavior. Consumers hoard, and business investment suffers.
The Fed will be aggressive until the labor market cracks. The Democratic Party better bundle up this winter.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
U.S. stock futures are modestly higher Wednesday ahead of a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve as it continues to cool the worst inflation in 40 years.
Futures for the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 each rose 0.4%.
It is no longer a question of if the Fed will raise rates Wednesday, but how high at the conclusion of the central bank's two-day meeting.
Bond yields mostly edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.56% from 3.52% from late Monday and is trading at its highest levels since 2011.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Fed action, held steady at 3.96%, hovering around its highest levels since 2007.
Stocks have slumped and Treasury yields have taken off as the Fed raises the cost of borrowing money to cool the economy.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell bluntly warned in a speech last month that the rate hikes would “bring some pain.”
In Europe, markets mostly rebounded at midday from earlier losses, with France's CAC 40 up 0.2%, Germany's DAX inching into positive territory and Britain's FTSE 100 up 0.9%.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.4% to finish at 27,313.13. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 6,700.20. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.9% to 2,347.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.8% to 18,444.62, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2% to 3,117.18.
Global tensions are adding to uncertainties. Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plans to start voting this week to become integral parts of Russia.
The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently blasted what he described as U.S. efforts to preserve its global domination and ordered officials to boost weapons production.
The war has killed thousands of people, driven up food prices worldwide and caused energy costs to soar. Natural gas futures are up 5% Wednesday after Putin's televised speech and stock in natural gas producers are among the biggest gainers on the S&P.
Later Wednesday, the Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third time. That would lift its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years, and up from zero at the start of the year.
The language used by Powell is read as closely as the decision on rate hikes, with markets seeking any clue as to how the Fed views the health of the U.S. economy.
Central banks worldwide are in the same dilemma, attempting to cool red-hot economies without tipping them into recession.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day monetary policy meeting Wednesday, although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy. Rate decisions from Norway, Switzerland and the Bank of England are next. Sweden surprised economists this week with a full point hike.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.57 to $86.02 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.5% Tuesday, weighing down energy stocks. Brent crude, the international standard, added $2.11 to $92.73 a barrel.
The average price for a gallon of gas went up for the first time in more than three months, rising to to $3.681 from $3.674, according to motor club AAA.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
U.S. stock futures are modestly higher Wednesday ahead of a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve as it continues to cool the worst inflation in 40 years.
Futures for the Dow Jones industrials and S&P 500 each rose 0.4%.
It is no longer a question of if the Fed will raise rates Wednesday, but how high at the conclusion of the central bank's two-day meeting.
Bond yields mostly edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.56% from 3.52% from late Monday and is trading at its highest levels since 2011.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Fed action, held steady at 3.96%, hovering around its highest levels since 2007.
Stocks have slumped and Treasury yields have taken off as the Fed raises the cost of borrowing money to cool the economy.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell bluntly warned in a speech last month that the rate hikes would “bring some pain.”
In Europe, markets mostly rebounded at midday from earlier losses, with France's CAC 40 up 0.2%, Germany's DAX inching into positive territory and Britain's FTSE 100 up 0.9%.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.4% to finish at 27,313.13. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 6,700.20. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.9% to 2,347.21. Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.8% to 18,444.62, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2% to 3,117.18.
Global tensions are adding to uncertainties. Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plans to start voting this week to become integral parts of Russia.
The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently blasted what he described as U.S. efforts to preserve its global domination and ordered officials to boost weapons production.
The war has killed thousands of people, driven up food prices worldwide and caused energy costs to soar. Natural gas futures are up 5% Wednesday after Putin's televised speech and stock in natural gas producers are among the biggest gainers on the S&P.
Later Wednesday, the Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third time. That would lift its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years, and up from zero at the start of the year.
The language used by Powell is read as closely as the decision on rate hikes, with markets seeking any clue as to how the Fed views the health of the U.S. economy.
Central banks worldwide are in the same dilemma, attempting to cool red-hot economies without tipping them into recession.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day monetary policy meeting Wednesday, although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy. Rate decisions from Norway, Switzerland and the Bank of England are next. Sweden surprised economists this week with a full point hike.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.57 to $86.02 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.5% Tuesday, weighing down energy stocks. Brent crude, the international standard, added $2.11 to $92.73 a barrel.
The average price for a gallon of gas went up for the first time in more than three months, rising to to $3.681 from $3.674, according to motor club AAA.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to 144.04 Japanese yen from 143.74 yen. The euro fell to 99.09 cents from 99.73 cents.

22,"Fed rate hike could add $2.1 trillion to federal deficits, new analysis finds",2022-09-21T13:44:13Z,"On top of everything else, the ongoing Federal Reserve campaign to tame inflation by raising interest rates is set to explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead.","The Federal Reserve's widely expected move to hike interest rates on Wednesday aims to tame inflation, but it could have other side effects — including a possible recession. It turns out a rate hike could also explode federal deficits even further in the years ahead.
A new analysis from the budget hawks at The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) predicts this week’s expected rate hike by three-quarters of a percentage point will — by itself — add $2.1 trillion to government deficits over the next decade.
That’s on top of a series of hikes we’ve already seen this year that have already added trillions more in costs. The central bank is concluding its two-day policy meeting Wednesday with more rate hikes likely to come in the months ahead.
To be sure, the deficit impact is far from the most pressing concern for policymakers focused on inflation. It nonetheless is a significant factor likely to challenge the Federal Reserve and fiscal policymakers as they try to navigate a “soft landing” that brings down the inflation rate without triggering a recession.
“The irresponsible fiscal policy [of recent years] has made the job of the Federal Reserve many times more difficult,"" Maya MacGuineas, the president of the CRFB, told Yahoo Finance this week. This challenge, she added, “makes the chance of a recession even more likely.”

The national debt — the total amount of money the U.S. government owes — sits at nearly $31 trillion. Meanwhile, the U.S. has a $1 trillion annual budget deficit, which is the amount of money the U.S. must borrow each year to pay for its expenses. Interest payments on the debt itself are projected to be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget in the years ahead.
“It's as though they're now walking on two different tight ropes at once,” MacGuineas says of the Federal Reserve’s challenges to curb inflation without inflaming the debt even further.
A range of other economists weighed in this week on Yahoo Finance on the chances of a soft landing for the economy on the eve of the Fed’s latest decision. Vanguard Senior International Economist Andrew Patterson said Tuesday that a Fed-induced recession could be hard to avoid in 2023 but the coming downturn “is, based on the data, likely to be somewhat more mild in nature.”
Story continues
Citi U.S. Wealth Management Head of Investment Strategy Shawn Snyder added that if the economy sees signs of recession, such as consecutive monthly job losses, in coming months that could put the Fed ""in a more difficult place, and I think that will put them in perhaps a holding pattern.""
The federal funds rate and the national debt
Back in the early 1980s, then-Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker led the charge against inflation. While the central bank’s benchmark interest rate had soared to the teens back then, Volcker had an advantage because the government debt then constituted just around 30% of GDP.
Today, the total debt has ballooned to around 120% of GDP.
On Wednesday, officials are expected to raise the federal funds rate to a range of 3.0% to 3.25% as part of an effort to bring inflation down from its current level of 8.3%. The move would mark the third-straight 75-basis-point rate hike since June and bring rates to their highest level since 2008.
In June, the CRFB analyzed the rate hikes up to that point and projected that annual interest costs will triple by 2032, up from nearly $400 billion now to $1.2 trillion next decade. The total costs were projected to be $8.1 trillion over the next decade. ""In reality, however, interest rates — and in turn interest costs — could be even higher,"" the authors added.
Economic observers will watch closely for hints from the Fed of how high it will raise interest rates in the months ahead, either from current Chair Jerome Powell’s comments or when the Fed releases a summary of interest rate expectations known as the “dot plot.”
‘Two very reckless periods of excess borrowing’
Speaking to Yahoo Finance, MacGuineas blamed the debt situation on spending binges from lawmakers in both parties. She acknowledged the importance of spending trillions spent to combat COVID. But, she added, “That was sandwiched in between two very reckless periods of excess borrowing when we shouldn't have.”
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 signed by then-President Trump and more recent spending from the Biden administration have both driven current record-breaking deficits, she said. Her group has recently criticized Biden’s executive order to forgive student loans, projecting it will add around half a trillion dollars to the already sky-high deficits.

In recent years, policymakers in both parties have downplayed debt concerns. Republicans have long argued that the 2017 tax cuts would pay for themselves, though that has not proven to be the case. Meanwhile, Democrats contend that deficits don’t matter; some cite the unorthodox economic principle known as Modern Monetary Theory, which posits the government can avoid the consequences of debt because it can print more money.
“All of these arguments seduce politicians into believing they don't have to pay for things,” MacGuineas said. These theories, she added, have ""given a permission slip to politicians who are all too eager to grab it.”

23,How big will it be? Investors brace for super-sized Federal Reserve rate hike,2022-09-21T13:39:25Z,US central bank expected to raise rates by at least 0.75% in next round of fight against inflation,"I nvestors from London to New York and beyond are looking to Washington for an interest rate decision that will reverberate around the world and offer fresh insight into the next rounds in the global fight against inflation.
The biggest central bank of them all – The Federal Reserve – will announce its decision on US interest rates at 7 p.m. UK time. The only doubt is how big a hike it will approve: the 0.75% established at its last two meetings, or a super-sized 1% move, as some experts in the City and Wall Street have predicted.
Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has repeatedly signalled his determination to tame inflation. Relatively robust economic data looks to give him more room for further aggressive action, while the latest reading of the US consumer price index (CPI) rose again last week, failing to meet hopes that it would show the first decline since May 2020.
Analysts say the lack of a clear sign that the Fed’s anti-inflation medicine has started to work in the last CPI opens the way for an even bigger rise.
But into the start of trade on Wednesday, the CME’s Fedwatch tool put an 84% chance on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sticking with a hike of 0.75%. That has helped New York stock markets rise in opening trade, with the S&P 500 up just over 20 points at 3879.30 on Wall Street, where there has been much talk of a bigger move, which would be likely to spark volatility on stock markets.
Greg Anderson, Director, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal, said: “We don’t think that Powell will push back against current market pricing, which basically has another 0.75% rate hike priced in.
“We would assign a lower probability to the Fed hiking by 1% than the 20% that is priced into money market curves.”
The dollar was stronger in the run up to the announcement, with the index tracking it against a range of other currencies up 0.5%. The pound was at fresh lows not seen since the 1980s, back under $1.14, as the dollar rose. Futures trade indicated an opening gain of over 20 points for the S&P 500 stock index.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The direction of interest rates is seen as vitally important to how investors allocate their capital between different asset classes, such as bonds, shares, property, commodities and cash. The return available on cash, and by extension the risk-free rate available on Government benchmark bonds, sets the reference point by which the attractiveness or otherwise of all asset classes will be judged,” he said.
“Markets are pricing in a peak of around 4.50% by the FOMC meeting of May 2023, before the first cuts come in the second half of next year,” Mould added.
The Fed adopted the 0.75% hike in June, for the first time since 1994. That came as a relief to stock market investors, where rising rates cause volatility and can improve the returns on offer from investment that are less risky than shares.
The Fed has lifted rates at every single one of its meetings since March, taking the range of its target rates to 3% to 3.25%, the highest since 2008 in what has become the biggest rate tightening cycle since the 1980s. In 2020, CPI inflation was at 1.4%. It reached 7% in 2021.",https://www.standard.co.uk/business/how-big-will-it-be-supersized-federal-reserve-rate-hike-0-75-or-1-markets-dollar-shares-pound-wall-street-open-b1027144.html

General Mills (GIS) was a mover Wednesday, with shares rising more than 2% in early morning trade after strong earnings results, though sales missed estimates. Homebuilders KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) will report after the close.
Micron Technology (MU) fell more than 2% after Mizuho downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.
Elsewhere, electric-vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) traded 0.5% lower Wednesday. Among the Dow Jones industrials, tech titans Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were mixed ahead of today's stock market open.
Top stocks to watch amid the market's recent weakness include Continental Resources (CLR), DoubleVerify (DV) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) — as well as Dow Jones stocks Chevron (CVX) and Merck (MRK). Keep in mind the new stock market correction is a good reason for investors to be mostly, if not entirely, on the sidelines.
DoubleVerify is an IBD Leaderboard stock, but its position size was trimmed during last week's losses. Tesla was featured in this week's Stocks Near A Buy Zone column.
Dow Jones Today: Treasury Yields, Oil Prices, Fed Meeting
Ahead of Wednesday's opening bell, Dow Jones futures were up 0.5% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures moved up 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% above fair value in morning action. Remember that overnight activity in Dow Jones futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.
Among exchange-traded funds, the Nasdaq 100 tracker Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.55%, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rose 0.6% in early trade.
The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 3.54% Wednesday, easing from this week's new high. Meanwhile, U.S. oil and natural gas prices surged. Oil prices rose more than 2%, putting West Texas Intermediate futures above $86 a barrel.
The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting will conclude Wednesday, with an interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. Markets show expectations at 82% that the central bank will raise rates by 75 basis points and an 18% probability of a 100 basis-point hike. Investors will be looking for hints at the pace of future rate hikes, and how high the central bank will eventually go.
Adding it all up, markets expect the Federal Reserve's key policy rate to end this year with a target range of either 4%-4.25% or, a bit more likely, 4.25%-4.5%. And that may not be all. Odds have nosed above 50% for one further quarter-point hike to a range of 4.5%-4.75% next March or May, according to CME Group's FedWatch page.
Stock Market Correction
On Tuesday, the stock market posted another disappointing performance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1%, while the S&P 500 declined 1.1%, both undercutting their Friday lows.
Tuesday's The Big Picture column commented, ""Amid expectations for a hawkish statement, the stock market may not like what the Fed has to say Wednesday. A tradable rally could ultimately lift the Nasdaq back to the 12,000 level. But it's still a market under distribution, so a trip to the June lows could also be in the cards.""
To prepare for a new stock market rally, investors should be waiting for a follow-through day. When the market is in a correction, look for at least one major index to attempt a bottom.
The first day the index closes higher counts as Day 1 of its attempted rally. The action on Day 2 and Day 3 is irrelevant as long as the index doesn't undercut its latest low. If that low is undercut, the rally try is done and the market needs to try again.
On Day 4 and later, you are looking for the Nasdaq or S&P 500 to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session. That's a follow-through day. It gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct buy points. It should put your portfolio and mindset in sync with the stock market action by gradually committing capital to leading stocks.
During stock market correction, don't tune out. Instead, create watchlists to find emerging stock market leadership by using the relative strength line. The RS line measures a stock's price performance vs. the S&P 500. If the stock is outperforming the broader market, the RS line angles upward. If a stock lags the broad market, the line will point lower.
Five Dow Jones Stocks To Watch Now

26,How big will it be? Investors brace for super-sized Federal Reserve rate hike,2022-09-21T13:03:08Z,US central bank expected to raise rates by at least 0.75% in next round of fight against inflation,"I nvestors from London to New York and beyond are looking to Washington for an interest rate decision that will reverberate around the world and offer fresh insight into the next rounds in the global fight against inflation.
The biggest central bank of them all – The Federal Reserve – will announce its decision on US interest rates at 7 p.m. UK time. The only doubt is how big a hike it will approve: the 0.75% established at its last two meetings, or a super-sized 1% move, as some experts in the City and Wall Street have predicted.
Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has repeatedly signalled his determination to tame inflation. Relatively robust economic data looks to give him more room for further aggressive action, while the latest reading of the US consumer price index (CPI) rose again last week, failing to meet hopes that it would show the first decline since May 2020.
Analysts say the lack of a clear sign that the Fed’s anti-inflation medicine has started to work in the last CPI opens the way for an even bigger rise.
But into the start of trade on Wednesday, the CME’s Fedwatch tool put an 84% chance on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sticking with a hike of 0.75%. That helped futures trade point to positive start to trade on Wall Street, where there has been much talk of a bigger move, which would be likely to spark volatility on stock markets.
Greg Anderson, Director, global head of FX strategy at the Bank of Montreal, said: “We don’t think that Powell will push back against current market pricing, which basically has another 0.75% rate hike priced in.
“We would assign a lower probability to the Fed hiking by 1% than the 20% that is priced into money market curves.”
The dollar was stronger in the run up to the announcement, with the index tracking it against a range of other currencies up 0.5%. The pound was at fresh lows not seen since the 1980s, back under $1.14, as the dollar rose. Futures trade indicated an opening gain of over 20 points for the S&P 500 stock index.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The direction of interest rates is seen as vitally important to how investors allocate their capital between different asset classes, such as bonds, shares, property, commodities and cash. The return available on cash, and by extension the risk-free rate available on Government benchmark bonds, sets the reference point by which the attractiveness or otherwise of all asset classes will be judged,” he said.
“Markets are pricing in a peak of around 4.50% by the FOMC meeting of May 2023, before the first cuts come in the second half of next year,” Mould added.
The Fed adopted the 0.75% hike in June, for the first time since 1994. That came as a relief to stock market investors, where rising rates cause volatility and can improve the returns on offer from investment that are less risky than shares.
The Fed has lifted rates at every single one of its meetings since March in what has become the biggest rate tightening cycle since the 1980s. In 2020, CPI inflation was at 1.4%. It reached 7% in 2021.",https://www.standard.co.uk/business/how-big-will-it-be-ir-supersized-federal-reserve-rate-hike-0-75-or-1-markets-dollar-shares-pound-b1027144.html
27,Dollar index highest in 20 years,2022-09-21T12:40:27Z,This comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve preparing a third rate hike to combat decades-high inflation in the country,"Londres, United Kingdom: European stock markets recovered from initial falls Wednesday, as traders awaited another hefty US interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The dollar reached the highest level in 20 years against a basket of major rival currencies with investors seeking safety as Russia escalates operations over Ukraine.
The Dollar index, which compares the US unit against currencies including the euro, pound and yen, jumped to 110.87 points, also as the Fed prepares a third successive jumbo rate hike to combat decades-high inflation.
The British pound hit a new 37-year low at $1.1305, even as the Bank of England prepares to announce its own large interest rate hike Thursday.
“The Fed is having to be cruel in order to restore price stability,” noted Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
“Higher rates will cause pain to households and businesses, with the jobs market being closely watched for signs of redundancies and hiring freezes.”
Most analysts are predicting that the Fed will announce another 75 basis-point lift, though some have tipped a full percentage-point move.
In the event of no surprises, the US central bank’s forecast and post-meeting comments from boss Jerome Powell will be the main attraction for investors.
“Volumes remain light and the mood cautious, with few looking to take on large positions before hearing what the Fed says,” according to Fiona Cincotta at City Index trading group.
Other central banks are meeting this week. On Tuesday, officials in Sweden surprised markets by unveiling a one percentage-point hike.
Adding to the cautious mood was Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation” as Russia’s president upped the ante in his battle against Ukraine.
Putin said he would annex the territories his forces had occupied and backed referendums in four regions in Russian-held parts of Ukraine.
“We will definitely use all means available” to protect Russian territory, he warned, adding: “That’s not a bluff.”
The moves mark an escalation in the seven-month war, which has roiled markets and sparked an energy crisis.
Oil prices surged nearly three per cent Wednesday, having wilted in recent months on weaker demand expectations fuelled by recession fears.
Putin’s announcement and possible escalation in the war “raises a whole new set of uncertainties”, Rabobank’s Jane Foley said.
Asian stock markets closed lower Wednesday, reversing Tuesday’s bounce.

Eccles Federal Reserve Building, photographed on Wednesday, July 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images
There's not a lot of mystery surrounding Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with markets widely expecting the central bank to approve its third consecutive three-quarter point interest rate hike. That doesn't mean there isn't considerable intrigue, though. related investing news There's one number that could be key to how markets trade right after the Fed meets With inflation still high, the Fed may be a long way from where it can stop hiking While the Fed almost certainly will deliver what the market has ordered, it has plenty of other items on its docket that will catch Wall Street's attention. Here's a quick rundown of what to expect from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting: Rates: In its continuing quest to tackle runaway inflation, the Fed almost certainly will approve a 0.75 percentage point hike that will take its benchmark rate up to a target range of 3%-3.25%. That's the highest the fed funds rate has been since early 2008. Markets are pricing in a slight chance for a full 1 percentage point hike, something the Fed has never done since it started using the fed funds rate as its primary policy tool in 1990. Economic outlook: Part of this week's meeting will see Fed officials issue their quarterly update of their interest rate and economic outlook. While the Summary of Economic Projections is not an official forecast, it does provide insight into where policymakers see various metrics and interest rates heading. The SEP includes estimates for GDP, unemployment and inflation as gauged by the personal consumption expenditures price index.
watch now
The ""dot plot"" and the ""terminal rate"": Investors will be most closely watching the so-called dot-plot of individual members' rate projections for the rest of 2022 and subsequent years, with this meeting's version extending for the first time into 2025. Included in that will be the projection for the ""terminal rate,"" or the point where officials think they can stop raising rates, which could be the most market-moving event of the meeting. In June, the committee put the terminal rate at 3.8%; it's likely to be at least half a percentage point higher following this week's meeting. Powell presser: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold his usual news conference following the conclusion of the two-day meeting. In his most notable remarks since the last meeting in July, Powell delivered a short, sharp address at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium in late August emphasizing his commitment to bringing down inflation and in particular his willingness to inflict ""some pain"" on the economy to make that happen. New kids on the block: One slight wrinkle at this meeting is the input of three relatively new members: Governor Michael S. Barr and regional presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Susan Collins of Boston.
Collins and Barr attended the previous meeting in July, but this will be their first SEP and dot plot. While individual names are not attached to projections, it will be interesting to see whether the new members are on board with the direction of Fed policy.
The big picture
Put it all together, and what investors will be watching most closely will be the meeting's tone – specifically how far the Fed is willing to go to tackle inflation and whether it is concerned about doing too much and taking the economy into a steeper recession. Judging by recent market action and commentary, the expectation is for a hawkish hardline. ""Fighting inflation is job-one,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. ""The consequences of not fighting inflation are greater than the consequences of fighting it. If that means recession, then that's what it means."" Winograd expects Powell and the Fed to stick to the Jackson Hole script that financial and economic stability are wholly dependent on price stability. In recent days, markets have begun to relinquish the belief that the Fed will only hike through this year then start cutting possibly by early or mid-2023. ""If inflation is really stubborn and stays high, they may just have to grit their teeth and have a recession that lasts for a while,"" said Bill English, a professor at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed economist. ""It's a very tough time to be a central banker right now, and they'll do their best. But it's hard."" The Fed has accomplished some of its goals toward tightening financial conditions, with stocks in retreat, the housing market slumping to the point of a recession and Treasury yields surging to highs not seen since the early days of the financial crisis. Household net worth fell more than 4% in the second quarter to $143.8 trillion, due largely to a decline in the valuation of stock market holdings, according to Fed data released earlier in September. However, the labor market has stayed strong and worker pay continues to rise, creating worries over a wage-price spiral even with gasoline costs at the pump in retreat. In recent days, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs conceded that the Fed may have to raise rates into 2023 to bring down prices. ""The kind of door that the Fed is trying to get through, where they slow things down enough to get inflation down but not so much that they case a recession is a very narrow door and I think it has gotten narrower,"" English said. There's a corresponding scenario where inflation stays stubbornly high and the Fed has to keep raising, which he said is ""a very bad alternative down the road.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-is-expected-to-do-today.html

30,The Fed's credibility is still on the line,2022-09-21T12:10:38Z,"The Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement represents a critical moment, as Wall Street waits to see how hard the central bank will go in its campaign to bring down stubbornly high inflation.","A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter.

London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement represents a critical moment, as Wall Street waits to see how hard the central bank will go in its campaign to bring down stubbornly high inflation.
What's happening: The Fed is expected to raise its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday to a range of 3% to 3.25%. But investors see some room for an even bigger hike.
They're putting an 18% probability on a dramatic full-point increase, a move that would shock markets and bolster the narrative that the Fed will do whatever it takes to get inflation under control.
Arguments could be made for both options. One on hand, inflation remains uncomfortably elevated, with consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 8.3% in August . That indicates borrowing costs may need to head higher to bring down demand and stave off more trouble ahead.
Yet the Fed also knows it takes a while for past rate hikes to feed through the system. And if its playbook is too tough, it could trigger a damaging recession and widespread economic pain, as well as reduce its options for future meetings.
""The faster the Fed hikes rates, the more likely they are to make a mistake,"" Gennadiy Goldberg, senior US rates strategist at TD Securities, told me.
A larger question also looms: Can the central bank retain confidence that it will successfully bring inflation to heel, a primary reason for its existence?
Faith in the Fed was rocked by Chair Jerome Powell's mistaken emphasis that inflation was ""transitory."" That incorrect assessment meant the Fed was delayed in addressing the problem and has to be more aggressive now.
Since then, some credibility has been restored. Bond market expectations for longer-term inflation have come down sharply in recent months, a sign these investors think the Fed is doing its job.
Take a look: Compare the yield on standard US Treasury bonds with those protected against inflation. The difference — known as the breakeven rate — tells you how much inflation investors foresee.
The five-year breakeven rate stands at 2.48%, down significantly from a high of 3.59% in March and not far off from the Fed's 2% target. The 10-year breakeven inflation rate sits at 2.4%.
""A lot of that has had to do with the Fed's very hawkish tone and their promise to keep hiking rates until inflation is back under control,"" Goldberg said.
Still, he warned it's way too soon to ""declare mission accomplished.""
""It's a very tenuous restoration of that confidence and of that faith in the Fed,"" Goldberg said. ""The difficulty now is the Fed has to follow through. It's easy to promise to be hawkish or to be very aggressive in the pace of tightening policy, but you're really forced to deliver that tightening at the end of the day.""
Dollar reaches new 20-year high as Putin escalates war
The latest: In a televised national address Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin announced an immediate partial mobilization of Russian citizens and threatened to use ""all the means at our disposal"" to defend Russia ""and our people."" He also referenced the potential use of nuclear weapons.
The speech pushed the greenback up 0.4% against a basket of major currencies to its strongest level since 2002. Investors often seek safe haven in US dollar assets during times of geopolitical tension.
Oil prices also jumped. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, gained more than 2%, rising to just below $93 per barrel.
The war has added to stress for investors, since it makes it harder to predict when inflation will ease and could push central banks to maintain an aggressive tack for longer.
It's also added to uncertainty around energy supplies. While gas reserves in Germany have been filled to 90% capacity, concerns remain.
Robert Habeck, Germany's minister for economic affairs, said that the country could ""get through winter well"" without Russian gas, but warned of ""really empty"" supply levels in the period thereafter.
And costs are rising. Germany nationalized its gas giant Uniper on Wednesday after an attempted bailout failed to prop up the utility.
On the radar: Kremlin-backed authorities in eastern and southern Ukraine have announced they will hold referendums on joining Russia this week. That could mark another pivotal point in the conflict.
The 'SPAC king' loses his crown
Chamath Palihapitiya built his brand boosting SPACs , the ""blank check"" companies that go public and then hunt for takeover targets. They exploded in popularity during the recovery from the pandemic, but have since fallen out of favor.
Now, even the outspoken venture capitalist is dealing with the consequences.
Palihapitiya announced on Tuesday that he would wind down two SPACs after they failed to find firms to merge with. Any funds raised will be returned to shareholders.
""Ultimately, to get a deal done would have required us stretching on price or buying an inferior asset — neither were things we felt comfortable doing,"" Palihapitiya said. He also said he saw ""resistance from management teams who either weren't prepared for or didn't want to face the public markets in the face of current volatility.""
Step back: Palihapitiya was one of the main proponents of SPACs and built a cult following among everyday investors. Yet his approach to investing has taken a knock this year as markets have been battered, a sign of how quickly fortunes on Wall Street have changed.
Virgin Galactic SPCE Stock inand SoFi Technologies, previous companies he helped take public, are down 62% and 63% in 2022, respectively.

31,Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates at September meeting,2022-09-21T11:55:45Z,The Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates at its September meeting Wednesday in order to fight high inflation,"The Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time.
WASHINGTON -- Last month, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he issued a blunt warning: The Fed's drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates, he said, would ""bring some pain"" for Americans.
When the Fed ends its latest meeting Wednesday and Powell holds a news conference, Americans will likely get a better idea of how much pain could be in store.
The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time. Another hike that large would boost its benchmark rate - which affects many consumer and business loans - to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years.
Many Fed watchers, though, will be paying particular attention to Powell's words at a news conference afterward. His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months - or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it's convinced that inflation is on its way down.
In a further sign of the Fed's deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year's end than it had forecast three months ago - and to keep them higher for longer. Economists expect Fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4% before the new year. They're also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%.
Short-term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures. Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.
The economy hasn't seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed's goal is to achieve a ""soft landing,"" by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession.
By last week, though, that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported that inflation over the past year was a painful 8.3%. Even worse, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose much faster than expected.
The inflation report also documented just how broadly inflation has spread through the economy, complicating the the Fed's task. Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers' steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession.
""They're going try to avoid recession,"" said William Dudley, formerly the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""The problem is that the room to do that is virtually non-existent at this point.""
The Fed's rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world's second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government's repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
At his news conference Wednesday, Powell isn't likely to drop any hints that the central bank will ease up on its credit tightening campaign. Most economists expect the Fed to stop raising rates in early 2023. But for now, they expect Powell to reinforce his hard-line anti-inflation stance.
""It's going to end up being a hard landing,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics.
""He's not going to say that,"" Bostjancic said. But, referring to the most recent Fed meeting in July, when Powell raised hopes for an eventual pullback on rate hikes, she added: ""He also wants to make sure that the markets don't come away and rally. That's what happened last time.""
Indeed, investors responded then by bidding up stock prices and buying bonds, which lowered rates on securities like the benchmark the 10-year Treasury. Higher stock prices and lower bond yields generally boost the economy - the opposite of what the Fed wants.
The central bank has already engaged in the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s. Yet some economists - and some Fed officials - argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the 12 officials who will vote on the Fed's decision Wednesday, said she thinks it will be necessary to raise the Fed's rate to ""somewhat above 4% by early next year and hold it there.""
""I do not anticipate the Fed cutting"" rates next year, Mester added, dispelling the expectations of many investors on Wall Street who had hoped for such a reversal. Comments like Mester's contributed to a sharp fall in stock prices last month that began after Powell's stern anti-inflation speech at the conference in Jackson Hole.
""Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,"" Powell said then - a remark widely interpreted to mean that the Fed will fight inflation even if it requires deep job losses and a recession.
Many economists sound convinced that a recession and widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.
Only a downturn that harsh would reduce wage growth and consumer spending enough to cool inflation, according to the a paper by Johns Hopkins University economist Laurence Ball and two economists at the International Monetary Fund.",https://abc7.com/fed-interest-rate-decision-today-hike-federal-reserve-meeting-inflation/12246316/
32,U.S. Federal Reserve set for big rate hike as waters get choppy for world’s central banks,2022-09-21T11:46:00Z,The decision will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world’s economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks,"U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington, on July 27.MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images
The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.
The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world’s economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.
While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00 per cent-3.25 per cent range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement.
Those projections will show where Fed policymakers think interest rates are heading, how long it will take inflation to fall, and how much “pain” is likely to be inflicted on U.S. employment and economic growth along the way.
If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4 per cent by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4 per cent that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment.
“With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed’s commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,” Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week. “They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.”
Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. central bank to eventually need to raise its policy rate to around 5.00 per cent, a level approaching the peak of 5.25 per cent seen from mid-2006 to 2007 when Fed policymakers were concerned about a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and one that could amplify stress across the global financial system.
Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to elaborate on the latest policy decision, and his tone will shape whether it is interpreted as a hawkish next step with more of the same ahead, or as a final bit of rate-hike “front-loading” before the Fed reverts to more conventional rate increases of 50 or 25 basis points as it feel its way to a stopping point.
Powell has had to correct himself in real time about the Fed’s likely path twice this year. In June, after he largely ruled out hiking rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, a surprise jump in inflation unnerved the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee and pushed its members towards the larger increase. In July, Powell’s comment that the Fed might move to smaller incremental rate increases was read as indicating an imminent policy pivot.
The Fed chief’s tone since then has become ardently hawkish, and, with the central bank’s preferred measure of inflation running more than three times its 2 per cent target, another dose of tough talk is anticipated.
“Risks still skew toward higher terminal policy rates and we expect a relatively hawkish FOMC meeting,” Citi economists wrote on Tuesday.
The hawkish stance has become the norm globally as central bankers dial up interest rate moves not seen since the 1990s, at the tail end of a fight in the developed world against inflation that had become entrenched in the 1970s.
The European Central Bank, following the Fed, earlier this month raised its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the first time ever; Sweden’s central bank this week approved its first full-percentage-point increase in 30 years.
The Bank of England and the central banks of Switzerland and Norway will meet this week, with markets expecting them to announce large rate hikes.
Such increases in borrowing costs can feed off each other, changing currency, price and trade dynamics in ways that prompt other central banks to react, particularly in emerging markets where exchange rate fluctuations and rising dollar interest rates can cause unexpected financial shocks.
Led by the Fed’s intensifying focus on fighting inflation, the tightening has become so pronounced that some have begun worrying about overkill.
“Central banks nearly everywhere feel accused of being on the back foot,” in failing to anticipate to prevent the jump of inflation in 2021, Maurice Obstfeld, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an essay last week published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The present danger, however, is not so much that current and planned moves will fail eventually to quell inflation. It is that they collectively go too far and drive the world economy into an unnecessarily harsh contraction.”
Between the aftershocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Bank President David Malpass warned last week that the global economy could be approaching “a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.”",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-us-federal-reserve-set-for-big-rate-hike-as-waters-get-choppy-for/

Equities around the world have been clattered by fears of a recession in major economies as central banks ramp up borrowing costs to combat the highest inflation in decades, which has been compounded by the Ukraine war and supply chain snarls.
In Washington, the Fed is due to conclude its latest policy meeting, with most analysts predicting it will announce another 75 basis-point lift, though some have tipped a full percentage-point move.
However, while the hike has largely been priced into the markets, the US central bank’s forecast and post-meeting comments from boss Jerome Powell are the main attraction for investors.
“Volumes remain light and the mood cautious, with few looking to take on large positions before hearing what the Fed says and where policy makers see rates going by the end of the hiking cycle,” Fiona Cincotta, at City Index, said.
“This is what will drive the markets, not the rate hike… but what the Fed plans to do next.”
Fed officials have for months stuck to the mantra that they will only ease up on their hawkish drive when inflation comes down and remains subdued.
This has led many to warn that rates are unlikely to come down anytime soon, possibly as late as 2024, with a recession more than likely in the United States as well as other major economies.
Other central banks are also meeting this week. On Tuesday, officials in Sweden surprised markets by unveiling a one percentage-point hike, while the United Kingdom and Switzerland are expected to announce more increases.
Asian markets were back in the red, reversing Tuesday’s bounce.
Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney were all down more than one percent, while there were also losses in Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei, Mumbai and Jakarta.
Adding to the dour mood was Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilization” as he upped the ante in his battle against Ukraine after his forces were routed from several cities in recent weeks.
He added that he would annex the territories his forces have already occupied and backed weekend referendums in four regions in Russian-held parts of Ukraine.
“We will definitely use all means available” to protect Russian territory, he warned, adding: “That’s not a bluff.” With AFP

34,Fed set to raise interest rates as recession fears mount,2022-09-21T11:35:00Z,"WASHINGTON, United States—The Federal Reserve is poised to roll out another big increase in interest rates Wednesday as it tries to cool the economy to tamp down the highest inflation in 40 years, but recession fears are rising.","WASHINGTON, United States—The Federal Reserve is poised to roll out another big increase in interest rates Wednesday as it tries to cool the economy to tamp down the highest inflation in 40 years, but recession fears are rising.
Soaring prices that are putting the squeeze on American families and businesses have already become a political liability for President Joe Biden, as he faces midterm congressional elections in early November.
But a contraction of the world’s largest economy would be a more damaging blow to Biden, to the Fed’s credibility and the world at large.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear that officials will continue to act aggressively to cool the economy and avoid a repeat of the 1970s and early 1980s, the last time US inflation got out of control.
It took tough action—and a recession—to finally bring prices down in the 1980s, and the Fed is unwilling to give up its hard-won, inflation-fighting credibility.

Many economists are expecting a third straight three-quarter point rate hike when the meeting concludes Wednesday, which would be an unprecedented action since that era. But there is a chance the Fed could opt for a full point increase.
Powell and other central bankers have been sending the same message: a downturn is better than continued high inflation given the pain that would inflict, especially on those least able to withstand it.
“Since inflation began to accelerate in early 2021, Fed officials have been overly optimistic that it would quickly recede to the central bank’s 2% target,” economists Mickey Levy and Andrew Levin wrote in The Wall Street Journal.
“The economy now faces a serious risk of persistent high inflation.”
The Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to announce its decision at 1600 GMT Wednesday.
Powell’s press conference after the meeting will be closely scrutinized for clues on how much more he thinks the Fed will have to do before it declares victory in the inflation fight.
Inflation is a global phenomenon amid the Russian war in Ukraine on top of global supply chain snarls and COVID lockdowns in China, and other major central banks are taking action as well.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said Tuesday that more increases will be needed to stop inflation from taking hold.
US policymakers have the luxury of a strong job market, and low unemployment, which gives it some leeway to tackle high prices.
Even so, many economists say at least a short period of negative GDP in the first half of 2023 will be needed before inflation starts coming down.

35,Another big interest rate hike expected today,2022-09-21T11:20:00Z,The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time.,"The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time.
WASHINGTON — Last month, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he issued a blunt warning: The Fed’s drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates, he said, would “bring some pain"" for Americans.
When the Fed ends its latest meeting Wednesday and Powell holds a news conference, Americans will likely get a better idea of how much pain could be in store.
The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time. Another hike that large would boost its benchmark rate — which affects many consumer and business loans — to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years.
Many Fed watchers, though, will be paying particular attention to Powell's words at a news conference afterward. His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months — or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it's convinced that inflation is on its way down.
In a further sign of the Fed's deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year's end than it had forecast three months ago — and to keep them higher for longer. Economists expect Fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4% before the new year. They're also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%.
Short-term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures. Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.
The economy hasn't seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed's goal is to achieve a “soft landing,"" by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession.
By last week, though, that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported that inflation over the past year was a painful 8.3%. Even worse, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose much faster than expected.
The inflation report also documented just how broadly inflation has spread through the economy, complicating the the Fed's task. Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers' steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession.
“They’re going try to avoid recession,” said William Dudley, formerly the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “The problem is that the room to do that is virtually non-existent at this point.”
The Fed’s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world’s second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government’s repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
At his news conference Wednesday, Powell isn't likely to drop any hints that the central bank will ease up on its credit tightening campaign. Most economists expect the Fed to stop raising rates in early 2023. But for now, they expect Powell to reinforce his hard-line anti-inflation stance.
“It's going to end up being a hard landing,” said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics.
“He’s not going to say that,"" Bostjancic said. But, referring to the most recent Fed meeting in July, when Powell raised hopes for an eventual pullback on rate hikes, she added: ""He also wants to make sure that the markets don’t come away and rally. That’s what happened last time.”
Indeed, investors responded then by bidding up stock prices and buying bonds, which lowered rates on securities like the benchmark the 10-year Treasury. Higher stock prices and lower bond yields generally boost the economy — the opposite of what the Fed wants.
The central bank has already engaged in the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s. Yet some economists — and some Fed officials — argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the 12 officials who will vote on the Fed's decision Wednesday, said she thinks it will be necessary to raise the Fed's rate to “somewhat above 4% by early next year and hold it there.""
“I do not anticipate the Fed cutting” rates next year, Mester added, dispelling the expectations of many investors on Wall Street who had hoped for such a reversal. Comments like Mester's contributed to a sharp fall in stock prices last month that began after Powell's stern anti-inflation speech at the conference in Jackson Hole.
“Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,” Powell said then — a remark widely interpreted to mean that the Fed will fight inflation even if it requires deep job losses and a recession.
Many economists sound convinced that a recession and widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.",https://www.wltx.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-reserve-meeting/507-be94b489-533a-4d3d-8ab4-f02a8a0170bb
36,How much 'pain' is the Fed willing to inflict? Wednesday's rate hike will offer clues,2022-09-21T11:00:56Z,The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation.,"Washington, DC CNN Business —
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third consecutive time in an aggressive move to tackle white-hot inflation that is plaguing the economy, frustrating consumers and stifling the Biden administration.
Imposing another massive hike would mark the central bank’s toughest policy move in its fight against inflation since the 1980s — another period of sky-high prices. It would also likely cause economic pain for millions of American businesses and households by pushing up the cost of borrowing for homes, cars and other loans.
The Fed’s anticipated actions would increase the rate that banks charge each other for overnight borrowing to 3-3.25%, the highest since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged the economic pain this rapid tightening regime may cause.
“We must keep at it until the job is done,” he said at an August central bankers’ forum in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he warned.
Investors and economists will be eagerly awaiting clarity on what that “pain” entails. So far, the Fed’s series of aggressive rate hikes mean that consumers are currently being charged the highest credit card rates since 1996, mortgage rates have topped 6%, and auto loans are the highest since 2012, noted Greg McBride, chief analyst at Bankrate.
Powell’s Jackson Hole comments also preceded new economic data that shows inflation, as measured by the latest Consumer Price Index report, is still elevated at 8.3% for the year ended in August. Moreover, the monthly reading from July to August showed that headline inflation crept up by 0.1%, when most economists expected it to slow. Core CPI, (which strips out volatile components like food and gas) rose twice as much as economists were expecting. That triggered a meltdown on Wall Street.
The higher prices mean that consumers are spending around $460 more per month on groceries than they were this time last year, according to Moody’s Analytics. Still, the job market remains strong, as does consumer spending. Housing prices remain high in many areas, even though there has been a substantial spike in mortgage rates. That means the Fed may feel that the economy can swallow more aggressive rate hikes.
A larger hike is possible, but unlikely
Some economists even expect the Fed to implement a massive — and historic — full-point rate hike on Wednesday. While that would be a considerable surprise at this point, August inflation data led to calls for the massive move.
Economists at brokerage Nomura Securities, for example, changed their forecast from 75 basis points to 100 basis points last week. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said he doesn’t think gradual increases in interest rates have been working to tamp down high prices: The Fed has hiked rates four times already this year, and inflation remains near 40-year highs, he pointed out.
But it’s unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by a full percentage point. The consensus amongst economists and Wall Street analysts is still for a 75 basis point hike, with just 18% projecting the larger hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Bad for markets, good for the Fed
Whichever path the Fed chooses, these are massive rate hikes that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago — and markets don’t often take kindly to interest rate hikes, which can negatively impact earnings and stock prices.
That may be what the Fed wants. Some economists think shocking markets is a good thing, and at least one Fed official agrees.
Neel Kashari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said last month that he was happy markets tanked after Powell warned of pain ahead. It meant that people understood the seriousness of the Fed’s commitment to getting inflation rates back down to 2%, he said.
The Fed wants “a weaker stock market. They want higher bond yields,” former New York Federal Reserve President Bill Dudley told CNN back in May. “The stock market I think is finally catching on to that.”
Investors may be hoping for a dovish pivot, but Powell is aiming to end the market’s “addiction to Fed easing when stocks decline,” said Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence.
What else investors are watching: The Federal Reserve will on Wednesday afternoon also release quarterly forecasts for inflation, the economy, and the future path of interest rates. Investors will study the central bank’s projections to try and predict future rate hikes and to gauge how policy officials expect their actions to impact the economy.
“Expect a broad-based uptick in unemployment projections for next year as the Fed further explains what it means by necessary ‘pain’ for the economy,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial.
The Federal Reserve announces its rate hike decision Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting. That will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Powell at 2:30 p.m.",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/21/economy/fed-rate-hike-september/index.html

The projections from the 19 policymakers, to be published in tandem with the announcement of what is likely to be the Fed's third straight 75-basis-point interest-rate hike, are not expected to coalesce around a massive jump in unemployment or a contraction of the economy.
Those were the outcomes the last time the Fed, under Paul Volcker's leadership, battled super-high inflation in the 1980s.

Earlier this month Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he believes that this time around the Fed can avoid such ""very high social costs"" in part because households and businesses haven't internalized the kind of inflationary mindset that back then required double-digit interest rates to vanquish.
At the same time, he said, Americans are in for ""some pain"" ahead as the Fed works to end inflation and prevent what would otherwise be even worse outcomes.
""While the Fed is still likely to view a soft landing as a modal outcome, the window appears to be narrowing,"" Bank of America economists wrote. ""Recent Fed communications have acknowledged this, in part, by leaning more strongly in the direction of needing to slow labor markets and accepting the risks to activity that come with it.""
UNEMPLOYMENT FORECAST IN FOCUS
And while the new quarterly summary of policymaker projections may appear to rule out a Volcker-style ""hard"" landing, it is widely expected to point to notably higher unemployment and slower economic growth in the coming year that by at least one well-known benchmark could signal a recession of some stripe.
That benchmark, known as the Sahm Rule after former Fed staffer Claudia Sahm who identified and formalized it, says the U.S. economy is typically in recession once the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the rate's lowest three-month average over the preceding 12 months. That low currently is around 3.56%.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.1% by the second quarter of 2023 and to 4.3% by the fourth quarter - far lower than the 14.7% reached in the pandemic crisis or the 10.8% peak during the Volcker recession - but high enough to meet the Sahm Rule test.
Historically once the unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point, it continues to rise another point or two, if not more.

Policymaker projections for the economy hinge on their views of the appropriate setting of monetary policy, a window into which will also be published on Wednesday as part of the Fed's quarterly summary of economic projections, or SEPs.
This week's decision is expected to take the Fed policy rate to a range of 3%-3.25% from the current 2.25%-2.50%. The so-called ""dot plot"" incorporated in the SEPs will indicate each policymaker's view of where rates should be at the end of each year through 2025.
""We expect the dot plot to show a peak fed funds rate of 4.4% next year, which will push the unemployment rate to near 4.5% over the forecast horizon,"" wrote economists at Deutsche Bank.
In the most recent forecasts issued in June, the fed funds rate was seen peaking at 3.8% in 2023, with the jobless rate climbing to 4.1% the following year.
RECESSION AHEAD?
Since the dot plot's advent in 2012, only one policymaker has ever forecast rates to rise that high, and that forecast - in late 2012 and early 2013, for end-of-year 2015 rates to reach 4.5% - turned out to be spectacularly wrong. The Fed instead kept the policy rate at near zero until December 2015, when it lifted it by just a quarter of a percentage point.
This time around, though, financial markets are pricing in a top Fed funds rate of 4.5% next year, with a rate cut or two seen as more than likely toward the second half of 2023.
Wednesday's projections will also give a read on how quickly Fed policymakers expect their actions to take a bite out of inflation and how much the economy is likely to slow.
In June, inflation was seen remaining above the Fed's 2% target through 2024, while not even the most pessimistic policymaker expected the economy to contract in coming quarters. Most penciled in gross domestic product growth of between 1.3% and 2% for each of the next three years.
""The new economic projections will highlight the Fed’s pain tolerance with real GDP growth likely to be revised significantly lower,"" wrote EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco, adding that the forecast for next year's unemployment rate could very well exceed 4.5%.
Inflation projections, however, could stick close to those laid out in June, he said, amid ""dueling forces from inflation persistence and a more aggressive Fed stance and likely recession.""

LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped to a new two-decade high on Wednesday, as a decision by Russia's President Vladimir Putin to mobilise more troops for the conflict in Ukraine rattled markets just before another expected aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike.
Putin on Wednesday called up 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine and said Moscow would respond with the might of all its vast arsenal if the West pursued what he called its ""nuclear blackmail"" over the conflict there. read more

Dollar index at two-decade high ahead of Fed
European currencies bore the brunt of selling in foreign exchange markets as Putin's comments exacerbated concern about the economic outlook for a region already hit hard by Russia's squeeze on gas supplies to Europe.
The euro fell to a two-week low of $0.9885 , within sight of two-decade lows hit earlier this month. It was last down 0.4% at $0.9930.
Sterling, which was down 0.3%, fell to a fresh 37-year low of $1.1304 .
""The Russia headlines are stealing the thunder from the Fed at least for now,"" said Societe Generale currency strategist Kenneth Broux.
""A concern about an escalation in the conflict is hurting European currencies. And if the Fed is also hawkish tonight then you could see the losses snowball.""
Later on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame inflation. read more
The policy decision, due at 1800 GMT, will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.
The dollar index is up almost 16% this year and set for its biggest annual surge since 1981.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars meanwhile hit multi-year lows. The Aussie hit a trough of $0.6655, its lowest since June 2020, while the kiwi fell to $0.5877, its lowest since April 2020.
Against the battered yen, the dollar was up just 0.12% at 143.89, holding off recent 24-year peaks
""It was interesting to me that dollar/yen dipped on the news of the announcement, potentially indicating a return of the yen's safe-haven credentials which have been absent for much of the year,"" said Colin Asher, a senior economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.

Global tensions are adding to uncertainties. Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plans to start voting this week to become integral parts of Russia.
The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war against Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently blasted what he described as US efforts to preserve its global domination and ordered officials to boost weapons production.
“Asian equities traded in a defensive mode on Wednesday. There were some geopolitical tensions concerning Russia and Ukraine, where the separatists are to hold a referendum in some regions, and traders were expecting an update from Putin,” Anderson Alves at ActivTrades said in a commentary.
Traders are focused on how high the Fed will raise interest rates at its meeting that ends on Wednesday, not on whether it will happen.
Bond yields mostly edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.56 per cent from 3.52 per cent from late Monday and is trading at its highest levels since 2011.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Fed action, held steady at 3.95 per cent, hovering around its highest levels since 2007.
Stocks have been slumping and Treasury yields rising as the Fed raises the cost of borrowing money in hopes of slowing down the hottest inflation in four decades.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell bluntly warned in a speech last month that the rate hikes would “bring some pain”.
The Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third time. That would lift its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent, the highest level in 14 years, and up from zero at the start of the year.
Beyond that, investors will be focused on what Powell has to say, both in the Fed's latest interest rate policy statement and during an afternoon press conference, for clues as to whether the central bank remains primarily focused on lowering inflation, or if there's a hint the Fed is giving more consideration to the impact of higher rates on the economy.
Wall Street is worried that the rate hikes could go too far in slowing economic growth and push the economy into a recession.
The US isn't alone in suffering from hot inflation or dealing with the impact of efforts to fight high prices.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy. Rate decisions from Norway, Switzerland and the Bank of England are next.
In energy trading, benchmark US crude rose USD 2.22 to USD 86.16 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Home sales look poised to decline further in the coming months, economists say, as mortgage rates recently topped 6% for the first time since 2008, when the U.S. was in a recession. Many first-time buyers have been priced out of the market, and existing homeowners are opting to stay put rather than give up their current low rates.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/existing-home-sales-prices-mortgage-rates-housing-market-august-2022-11663711368

NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.00%-3.25% on Wednesday and signaled more large increases to come in new projections showing its policy rate rising to 4.40% by the end of this year before topping out at 4.60% in 2023 to battle continued strong inflation.
The U.S. central bank's quarterly economic projections, meanwhile, showed the economy slowing to a crawl in 2022, with year-end growth at 0.2%, rising to 1.2% in 2023, well below the economy's potential. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 3.8% this year and 4.4% in 2023. Inflation is seen slowly returning to the Fed's 2% target in 2025.

COMMENTS:
MATT STUCKY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT COMPANY, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN
""The big takeaway here is not so much the decision to raise by 75 basis points. In terms of discussion in the statement, we have been thinking about the Federal Reserve policy as moving in one direction but increasingly, as they've moved into hawkish territory as markets have started to pencil in a terminal fed funds rate in 2023 approaching four and a half percent, that we might start to get at least an acknowledgement that the risks are becoming two-sided in terms of monetary policy stance. Certainly there are risks of inflation, but the opposite side of that is there are risks to the overall economy...there continues to be, at least so far, not any kind of concrete acknowledgement that risks are growing to the forward economic outlook... The Fed remains singularly focused on fighting inflation. So this is a pretty hawkish 75 basis point increase when it comes to how the text reads.""
LINDSEY BELL, CHIEF MARKETS & MONEY STRATEGIST, ALLY
""The 75 basis points increase was expected. What the market is reacting to is the update to expectations for rates for the out-years. They moved significantly higher ... The market would've liked to see the number come down in 2023. What it's telling us is that the Fed is expecting to rates to continue to move higher into 2023.""
""The silver lining is that six members think rates are going to stay steady and one thinks they can come down in 2023.""
""Now the question is what is the market is going to price in here. What do we really believe will happen? There's a camp that says whatever the Fed guides to has typically been the floor and not the ceiling. This communication is basically signaling that the Fed's going to continue to be aggressive and remain hawkish. That's going to continue to put pressure on stocks. It doesn't leave a lot of room to the upside for investors going into the end of the year.""
""Right now it doesn't feel great because the Fed's going to stay hawkish. They're not backing down. Where we end the day is going to be predicated on Powell's speech.""
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
“The unusual has become usual. Not only did the Fed hike another unusually large 75 bps today, it is basically saying it will do it again in November. Thinking that these types of hikes aren’t going to cause pain down the road is the triumph of hope over experience.”
ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
“The stock market is taking this in stride, it did go down a little bit but it’s not too dramatic. The updated statement of economic projections suggest that the Fed is reluctantly, slowly, catching up to reality in terms of their anticipation for everything – for inflation, for core inflation, for GDP. You look at the difference between December, to march, to June, to now, in all of those metrics and what they are projecting and they are finally catching up with what the market has already known for quite some time. So perhaps the equity market was a little bit optimistic they might soften the language, which they did not do, but in general most of this was priced into the equity market.
""A lot of times you see (the market) do something on the day of and then something else the next day, investors might want to reserve judgment until tomorrow.”
THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NYC
“This is as hawkish as it gets and the only way to back off it is in the press conference if Powell says we're going to remain data dependent.”
“As we found through history, the initial knee jerk reaction tends to be wrong. But markets really do want to see Powell signal some flexibility moving forward in order to kind of stabilize the market. So I think you want to hear him say 'data dependent,' 'flexible,' but at the same time stand firm in terms of their commitment to bring inflation down.”
RYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CARSON GROUP, OMAHA
“It was a rather hawkish 75 basis point hike, and (the Fed) left the door wide open for even more rate hikes before the end of the year.”
“The dot plots confirm more hikes are coming than were previously expected.
“The Fed is willing to produce a good deal of pain to the economy, and potentially to the stock market in order to rein in the runaway inflation we’ve been seeing this year.”
“The economic expectations from the Fed are quite disappointing. The economy is quickly slowing.”
“Yields and the dollar both moved higher on the hawkish Fed stance, pressuring stocks once again.”
""The Fed is willing to produce a good deal of pain to the economy and potentially the stock market in order to rein in the runaway inflation we’ve been seeing this year.""
The economic expectations from the Fed are quite disappointing, the economy is quickly slowing. The Fed is okay with this with their hawkish stance in order to slow inflation.
The Powell press conference is coming up. He will continue to pull his inner Paul Volcker and stress how important it is to bring inflation under control, even if it potentially slows the economy and causes pain for most consumers.”

44,How the Car Market Is Shedding Light on a Key Inflation Question,2022-09-21T09:00:24Z,How easily companies give up swollen profits could determine how easily the Federal Reserve can cool inflation. Dealerships offer clues.,"The Fed could raise rates so much that it snuffs out demand, but given how much pent-up car-buying appetite exists, Mr. Murphy thinks it would take a lot.
“You probably would have to go farther on rates than they have so far, or even than they are expected to go,” he said. “There may be a point at which you have enough pain that you see a pause on demand.”
If demand continues to outstrip new-car supply and dealers continue to reap big profits, that could limit how quickly inflation will ease. If the mismatch is large enough for sellers to keep pushing up prices without losing customers, it could even continue to fuel inflation.
While the car market is just one industry, the uncertainty of its return to normal holds a few lessons for the Fed. For one thing, new-car production makes it clear that supply chain disruptions are improving but not gone.
More hopefully, the car industry could offer evidence that the laws of economics are likely to reassert themselves eventually. Used-car prices have at least stopped their ascent as inventory has grown, and experts say discounting is likely around the corner. If that happens, it could be evidence that companies won’t be able to keep prices and profits high indefinitely once supply catches up with demand.
But cars reinforce the prospect that the readjustment period could last a while.
Automakers are flirting with the idea of keeping production lower so there are fewer cars in the market and price cuts are less common. Mr. Smoke is skeptical that they will hold that line once it means ceding market share to competitors — but the process could take months or years.
“I’m hesitant to say that we won’t have discounting again,” Mr. Smoke said. “But it’s going to take a while to get back to that world.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/business/economy/inflation-car-market.html

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine peso continued to weaken against the greenback, as investors anticipated another massive interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.
On Wednesday, September 21, the peso closed at P58 against the US dollar, a new low.
The dollar is at its strongest in over two decades.
Analysts expect a Fed rate hike of 75 basis points for the third straight time since June, which would bring rates to their highest level since 2008. Some rate futures traders even anticipate a 100-basis-point tightening.
The Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday evening (early Thursday, September 22, Manila time).
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is also set to announce its monetary policy stance on Thursday, with most analysts bracing for a hike of 50 basis points.
BSP Governor Felipe Medalla earlier said they have done enough, adding that there is no peso problem but “a dollar problem.”

46,Treasury yields fall ahead of Federal Reserve interest rate decision,2022-09-21T08:29:59Z,"Treasury yields stumbled on Wednesday, coming off recent highs as traders await the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate hikes.","The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was last at 3.5279%, down by 4 basis points. Meanwhile, the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury declined by 2 basis points and was last at 3.9418%. Both Treasury notes had reached highs on Tuesday, rising to levels last seen in 2011 and 2007 respectively.
The Federal Reserve is expected to announce interest rate hikes aiming to control inflation on Wednesday as its September meeting comes to a close. Analysts are broadly expecting a 75 basis point hike, but some think the central bank will go beyond this to 100 basis points. That would mark the largest interest rate hike in 40 years.
But even that may not be enough, Michael Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, told CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" explaining that while he is expecting a 75 basis point hike, he would argue for a 150 basis point hike as he believes rates are headed higher still.
Treasuries could also be a source of safety for investors, he added. ""Relative safety I would look at the front-end of the U.S. Treasury curve. You've got the 2-year treasury yielding just about 4%. It's gone up enormously,"" he said. ""If you think about the real yield, which a lot of people in the bond market focus on, it's probably not a bad place to hide out.""

Under the latest version of the bill, it would be illegal to issue or create new “endogenously collateralised stablecoins,” according to a copy sighted by Bloomberg. The definition would kick in for stablecoins marketed as being able to be converted, redeemed or repurchased for a fixed amount of monetary value, and that rely solely on the value of another digital asset from the same creator to maintain their fixed price.
TerraUSD, also known as UST, was designed to maintain a one-to-one peg to the US dollar through an algorithm and trading in a sister token called Luna. That experiment failed spectacularly when UST crashed in May, resulting in billions of dollar of losses and prompting policymakers to take renewed interest in stablecoins.
The collapse of stablecoin terra and the terra ecosystem, and the tokens Luna and UST, will go down as one of the most painful and devastating chapters in the brief history of cryptocurrencies. Bloomberg
The draft legislation would mandate a study on terra-like tokens from US Treasury in consultation with the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Maxine Waters and ranking member Patrick McHenry have been working to reach an agreement on the stablecoin legislation, though people familiar with the discussions said it’s unclear if Mr McHenry, a Republican, has approved the latest draft.

The continent-wide STOXX 600 index dropped 0.3%, with most of its sub-sectors lower. Rate-sensitive technology sector index fell 1.2%, while energy stocks gained 1% amid a rise in oil prices following the news of mobilisation. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of its 2 million-strong military reserves, in a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. This is Moscow's first mobilisation since World War Two.
The Fed is seen raising its benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points (bps) later in the day, continuing its aggressive fight against persistently high inflation.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly declined Wednesday as investors looked ahead to a widely expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve as it works to squash the highest inflation in decades.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.4% to finish at 27,313.13. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.6% to 6,700.20. South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.9% to 2,347.21. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1.7% to 18,460.71, while the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2% to 3,117.18.
Global tensions are adding to uncertainties. Russian-controlled regions of eastern and southern Ukraine have announced plans to start voting this week to become integral parts of Russia.
The Kremlin-backed efforts to swallow up four regions could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently blasted what he described as U.S. efforts to preserve its global domination and ordered officials to boost weapons production.

“Asian equities traded in a defensive mode on Wednesday. There were some geopolitical tensions concerning Russia and Ukraine, where the separatists are to hold a referendum in some regions, and traders were expecting an update from Putin,” Anderson Alves at ActivTrades said in a commentary.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 index fell 1.1% on Tuesday to 3,855.93, as more than 90% of stocks and every sector in the benchmark index lost ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% to 30,706.23. The Nasdaq composite also fell 1%, to 11,425.05.
The selling came as traders waited to see how high the Fed will raise interest rates at its meeting that ends Wednesday.
Smaller company stocks fell more than the broader market. The Russell 2000 index gave up 1.4% to 1,787.50.
“The market is certainly bracing for the worst and you’re seeing a little bit of selling pressure coming in,” said Paul Kim, CEO of Simplify ETFs.
Bond yields mostly edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.56% from 3.52% from late Monday and is trading at its highest levels since 2011.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tends to follow expectations for Fed action, held steady at 3.95%, hovering around its highest levels since 2007.
Stocks have been slumping and Treasury yields rising as the Fed raises the cost of borrowing money in hopes of slowing down the hottest inflation in four decades.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell bluntly warned in a speech last month that the rate hikes would “bring some pain.”
The Fed is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third time at its meeting on Wednesday. That would lift its benchmark rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years, and up from zero at the start of the year.
Beyond that, investors will be focused on what Powell has to say, both in the Fed’s latest interest rate policy statement and during an afternoon press conference, for clues as to whether the central bank remains primarily focused on lowering inflation, or if there’s a hint the Fed is giving more consideration to the impact of higher rates on the economy.

Wall Street is worried that the rate hikes could go too far in slowing economic growth and push the economy into a recession.
The U.S. isn’t alone in suffering from hot inflation or dealing with the impact of efforts to fight high prices.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day monetary policy meeting Wednesday, although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy. Rate decisions from Norway, Switzerland and the Bank of England are next.
In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude rose $1.95 to $85.89 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.5% Tuesday, weighing down energy stocks. Brent crude, the international standard, added $2.09 to $92.71 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched down to 143.53 Japanese yen from 143.74 yen. The euro fell to 99.64 cents from 99.73 cents.

Beyond that, investors will be focused on what Powell has to say, both in the Fed's latest interest rate policy statement and during an afternoon press conference, for clues as to whether the central bank remains primarily focused on lowering inflation, or if there's a hint the Fed is giving more consideration to the impact of higher rates on the economy.
Wall Street is worried that the rate hikes could go too far in slowing economic growth and push the economy into a recession.
The U.S. isn't alone in suffering from hot inflation or dealing with the impact of efforts to fight high prices.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day monetary policy meeting Wednesday, although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy. Rate decisions from Norway, Switzerland and the Bank of England are next.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose $2.22 to $86.16 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 1.5% Tuesday, weighing down energy stocks. Brent crude, the international standard, added $2.34 to $92.96 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar inched up to 143.81 Japanese yen from 143.74 yen. The euro fell to 99.01 cents from 99.73 cents.

51,"The Canadian dollar just fell below75 cents U.S., its lowest level in two years - here’s why",2022-09-21T07:00:00Z,The weakening Canadian dollar is tied to the U.S. federal reserve continuously hiking its key overnight lending rate to curb inflation.,"The Canadian dollar fell to its lowest level in almost two years Tuesday — closing at 74.82 cents U.S. — as the economy struggles to absorb high inflation and faces a possible global recession.
The weakening Canadian dollar is tied to the U.S. federal reserve continuously hiking its key overnight lending rate to curb inflation. Relentlessly high inflation in the U.S. has the country’s central bank raising rates aggressively, with a three-quarter percentage point hike expected on Sept. 21.
The U.S.’s policy interest rate, which allows the central bank to influence short-term interest rates, could rise to at least 3.25 per cent with some analysts expecting the policy rate to reach 4.5 per cent next year. This is higher than where the Bank of Canada is expected to take rates, widening the gap between the two country’s currencies.
“The catalyst for the weakening Canadian dollar is core inflationary pressure that we’re seeing in the U.S.,” said Bipan Rai, foreign exchange analyst with CIBC. “We’re expecting at least an increase of 75 basis points from the federal reserve tomorrow, with hikes continuing to an uncertain date. Because of the economic uncertainty the hikes are creating, the Canadian dollar will be impacted.”
Over the last year, the Canadian dollar has been gradually sliding in comparison to a “very strong” U.S. dollar, said Shaun Osborne, foreign exchange analyst with Scotiabank.
Generally, higher interest rates cause a country’s currency to rise attracting foreign investment and heightening the demand for a country’s currency. Because of this, the U.S. is a “currency haven” often one of the strongest currencies globally, Osborne said. While positive for the U.S., Canada ends up living in its neighbour’s shadow. Also comparatively the Canadian economy is much smaller, he added.
Unlike the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar is tied more to commodities such as oil. Typically, when oil prices rise the Canadian dollar strengthens — the dollar is reliant on the sale of crude oil to the U.S. However, this year, when oil prices skyrocketed to more than $100 a barrel, the Canadian dollar continued to slip.
The reason isn’t fully known, said Osborne, but less investment in the oil sector and the greenification of the country’s economy could both be factors.
Because the Canadian dollar is also tied to economic growth, the impending global recession paints a less rosy picture for the country’s currency, said Adam Button, chief currency analyst with foreign exchange firm ForexLive.
“Our currency is growth sensitive, and is closely tied to our resources which we export,” he said. “If the global economy weakens and underperforms that’s reflected in our currency.”
While the Canadian dollar has dropped, it’s done comparatively well compared to the euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. For example, in the last year, the Japanese yen dropped by almost 25 per cent making the currency much weaker, whereas the Canadian dollar dropped by four per cent during the same time period.
“The Canadian dollar has held up relatively well as the Bank of Canada has been more aggressive in it’s rate hikes compared to Japan and Europe,” said Scotiabank’s Osborne. “They’ve come late to the rate tightening party.”
Since 2015, the Canadian dollar has ranged from 68 cents U.S. to 83 cents U.S. and it’s now drifting back to the middle of that range, Osborne said.
Right now, analysts aren’t concerned about the Canadian dollar’s drop as its in line with historical trends. But if the federal reserve keeps hiking rates, beyond Bank of Canada rate hikes, more money will pour into the U.S. which could result in a weaker Canadian dollar, dipping below 73 cents U.S. by the end of the year, Button said.
Canada’s economy will take a hit when trading with the U.S. as exported goods will be less expensive for the U.S. to sell and Canadian importers will struggle as prices are pushed upward.
For now, Canadians won’t feel the pinch of a weaker exchange, accept when travelling to the U.S.
“It will be cheaper to go to the eurozone for the next few months instead,” Osborne said.

Article content Just two weeks ago, Bank Governor Tiff Macklem announced a Canadian rate hike of 75 basis points. But he signaled that it wouldn’t be the last such move this year. Consumers are scrambling to figure out what this means for them. The objective of the central bankers is to cool inflation. So, fingers crossed, this means that in the near future the price of groceries and other goods won’t be rising so aggressively or even begin to cool. That’s the good news. The bad news is that anyone exposed to current rates will really feel the pain soon. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

53,U.S. Federal Reserve escalates its inflation fight with another big rate hike,2022-09-21T07:00:00Z,"The Fed’s move boosted its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent, the highest level since early 2008","WASHINGTON — Intensifying its fight against high inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate Wednesday by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a third straight time and signalled more large rate hikes to come — an aggressive pace that will heighten the risk of an eventual recession.
The Fed’s move boosted its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent, the highest level since early 2008.
The officials also forecast that they will further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4.4 per cent by year’s end, a full percentage point higher than they had forecast as recently as June. And they expect to raise the rate further next year, to about 4.6 per cent. That would be the highest level since 2007.
The central bank’s action Wednesday followed a government report last week that showed high costs spreading more broadly through the economy. By raising borrowing rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan. Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the economy and slowing inflation.
Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said that before Fed officials would consider halting their rate hikes, they would “want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down” to their 2% inflation target. He noted that the strength of the job market is fuelling wage gains that are helping drive up inflation.
Fed officials have said they are seeking a “soft landing,” by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession. Yet most economists say they think the Fed’s steep rate hikes will lead, over time, to job cuts, rising unemployment and a full-blown recession late this year or early next year.
“No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession, or if so, how significant that recession would be,” Powell said at his news conference. “That’s going to depend on how quickly we bring down inflation.”
In their updated economic forecasts, the Fed’s policymakers project that economic growth will remain weak for the next few years, with rising unemployment. It expects the jobless rate to reach 4.4 per cent by the end of 2023, up from its current level of 3.7 per cent. Historically, economists say, any time the unemployment rate has risen by a half-point over several months, a recession has always followed.
Fed officials now see the economy expanding just 0.2% this year, sharply lower than its forecast of 1.7 per cent growth just three months ago. And it expects sluggish growth below 2 per cent from 2023 through 2025.
And even with the steep rate hikes the Fed foresees, it still expects core inflation — which excludes the volatile food and gas categories — to be 3.1% at the end of next year, well above its 2% target.
Powell acknowledged in a speech last month that the Fed’s moves will “bring some pain” to households and businesses. And he added that the central bank’s commitment to bringing inflation back down to its 2 per cent target was “unconditional.”
Falling gas prices have slightly lowered headline inflation, which was a still-painful 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier. Declining gas prices might have contributed to a recent rise in President Joe Biden’s public approval ratings, which Democrats hope will boost their prospects in the November midterm elections.
Short-term rates at a level the Fed is now envisioning would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. The economy hasn’t seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Inflation now appears increasingly fuelled by higher wages and by consumers’ steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedevilled the economy during the pandemic recession. On Sunday, though, Biden said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that he believed a soft landing for the economy was still possible, suggesting that his administration’s recent energy and health care legislation would lower prices for pharmaceuticals and health care.
Some economists are beginning to express concern that the Fed’s rapid rate hikes — the fastest since the early 1980s — will cause more economic damage than necessary to tame inflation. Mike Konczal, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, noted that the economy is already slowing and that wage increases — a key driver of inflation — are levelling off and by some measures even declining a bit.
Surveys also show that Americans are expecting inflation to ease significantly over the next five years. That is an important trend because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect inflation to ease, some will feel less pressure to accelerate their purchases. Less spending would then help moderate price increases.
Konczal said there is a case to be made for the Fed to slow its rate hikes over the next two meetings.
“Given the cooling that’s coming,” he said, “you don’t want to rush into this.”
The Fed’s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world’s second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government’s repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
Even at the Fed’s accelerated pace of rate hikes, some economists — and some Fed officials — argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Many economists sound convinced that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.

The prospect of another aggressive rates rise kept up the pressure on Wall Street shares ahead of tonight’s decision by the US Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1% last night and is at its lowest level in two months, a performance matched by the S&P 500 and tech-focused Nasdaq.
The declines reflected fears of a hard landing for the US economy if there’s another increase of at least 0.75% in the Fed funds rate later today.
The FTSE 100 index finished 0.6% lower last night and the FTSE 250 fell by 1.4%, with a pause in the selling pressure expected today as investors stay on the sidelines ahead of the decision and subsequent comments by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “There are some voices calling for 100 basis points. However this could well come across as knee jerk and suggest that the Fed is panicking and could send completely the wrong message to markets.
“The Fed needs to show it is in control of events and raise rates by 75 basis points but also indicate that further substantial rate rises would be forthcoming until there is clear evidence that inflation is starting to come down at a sustainable rate.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/business/ftse-100-live-21-september-us-interest-rates-us-federal-reserve-meeting-uk-public-finances-government-debt-interest-b1027015.html
56,Federal Reserve warns of ‘pain’ ahead as inflation surges,2022-09-21T06:00:22Z,The US central bank is expected to announce a sharp rise in interest rates on Wednesday in an attempt to tackle the cost of living crisis,"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned last month that there would be “pain” ahead as the US central bank struggles to contain a surge in inflation unseen in 40 years. Powell will offer some indication of how much pain he expects on Wednesday.
The Fed is expected to announce another sharp rise in interest rates on Wednesday afternoon after the conclusion of its latest meeting. It will also update its economic forecasts for the US economy.
Economists are predicting the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months.
The hike comes as central banks around the world are increasing rates to tackle a soaring cost of living crisis. The Bank of England is expected to announce its largest rate rise in 25 years this week and the European Central Bank raised interest rates across the eurozone by a record margin earlier this month as inflation reached double figures in some of its 19 member countries.
Last year the Fed dismissed inflation as a “transitory” issue triggered by the pandemic and supply chain issues, but consumer prices have remained stubbornly high and have remained so despite a change in the Fed’s view and its aggressive rate rises.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced last week that prices were 8.3% higher last month compared with August last year. The Fed’s target rate for inflation is 2% annually.
That news has led some to speculate that the Fed could increase rates by a full percentage point, a drastic move for an institution that usually moves rates cautiously up and down by a quarter percentage point.
The sharp rise in interest rates are aimed at slowing the economy and bringing down prices. Higher rates have fed through to the housing market, where ​​rates for a 30-year mortgage have now passed the 6% mark for the first time in 14 years.
But rate rises take time to filter through to the wider economy and so far they have done little to tamp down inflation, nor has it impacted the jobs market. Last month the US added 315,00 new jobs and the unemployment rate, at 3.7%, remains close to a 50-year low.
Until recently Powell had suggested a “soft landing” was possible for the economy, in which rising rates would bring down prices without causing a severe financial downturn.
But at the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last month Powell acknowledged that economic distress was a price the Fed was willing to pay to control inflation. “While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” he said. “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.”
Ellen Zentner, chief US economist at Morgan Stanley, said the Fed had yet to see the “pain” it believes is necessary to tame inflation.
“Thus far, higher rates have inflicted little widespread pain on the real economy, so the Fed has room to continue hiking into restrictive territory. Consider that so far, a housing correction is under way, if you squint really hard you can see net job gains slowing, and we’ve seen some deceleration in consumer spending, but this isn’t enough to produce the sustained below-potential growth that the chair is looking for,” Zentner wrote in a note to investors. “Bottom line is that the Fed needs more evidence that its actions are taking a bite out of the real economy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/21/federal-reserve-inflation-rate-forecast-economy

Consumer inflation in the US declined marginally in August to 8.3 per cent from 8.5 per cent in July but is way above the 2 per cent goal. Several senior top bankers recently said that another interest rate hike is imminent. Raising interest rates is a monetary policy instrument that typically helps suppress demand in the economy, thereby enabling the inflation rate to decline.
The US central bank is expected to raise the rates by another 50-75 basis points. Already it has increased rates by 150 basis points. The US Federal Reserve will be single-mindedly focused on inflation until it is lowered closer to the 2 per cent target on a sustained basis, said global business intelligence solution firm S&P Global Market Intelligence. It is expected to raise the rates by another 75 basis points to a range of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent -- which would be the third consecutive increase of that magnitude.
US Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller recently gave a hint the decision at the monetary policy meeting will be ""straightforward"" and the central bank will continue to fight inflation aggressively. Meanwhile, RBI too will sit for a monetary policy review later this month and further rate hikes are highly expected. Morgan Stanley expects a 50 basis points hike by the RBI.
As per schedule, the next three-day monetary policy meeting will be held during September 28-30. (ANI)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Last month, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he issued a blunt warning: The Fed’s drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates, he said, would “bring some pain” for Americans.
When the Fed ends its latest meeting Wednesday and Powell holds a news conference, Americans will likely get a better idea of how much pain could be in store.
The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time . Another hike that large would boost its benchmark rate — which affects many consumer and business loans — to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years.
Many Fed watchers, though, will be paying particular attention to Powell’s words at a news conference afterward. His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months — or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it’s convinced that inflation is on its way down.

In a further sign of the Fed’s deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year’s end than it had forecast three months ago — and to keep them higher for longer. Economists expect Fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4% before the new year. They’re also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%.
Short-term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans . The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures. Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.
The economy hasn’t seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6% , its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.

Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed’s goal is to achieve a “soft landing,” by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession.
By last week, though, that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported that inflation over the past year was a painful 8.3% . Even worse, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose much faster than expected.
The inflation report also documented just how broadly inflation has spread through the economy, complicating the the Fed’s task. Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers’ steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession.
“They’re going try to avoid recession,” said William Dudley, formerly the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “The problem is that the room to do that is virtually non-existent at this point.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Fed’s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world’s second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government’s repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
At his news conference Wednesday, Powell isn’t likely to drop any hints that the central bank will ease up on its credit tightening campaign. Most economists expect the Fed to stop raising rates in early 2023. But for now, they expect Powell to reinforce his hard-line anti-inflation stance.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s going to end up being a hard landing,” said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics.
“He’s not going to say that,” Bostjancic said. But, referring to the most recent Fed meeting in July, when Powell raised hopes for an eventual pullback on rate hikes, she added: “He also wants to make sure that the markets don’t come away and rally. That’s what happened last time.”
Indeed, investors responded then by bidding up stock prices and buying bonds, which lowered rates on securities like the benchmark the 10-year Treasury. Higher stock prices and lower bond yields generally boost the economy — the opposite of what the Fed wants.
The central bank has already engaged in the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s. Yet some economists — and some Fed officials — argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the 12 officials who will vote on the Fed’s decision Wednesday, said she thinks it will be necessary to raise the Fed’s rate to “somewhat above 4% by early next year and hold it there.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“I do not anticipate the Fed cutting” rates next year, Mester added, dispelling the expectations of many investors on Wall Street who had hoped for such a reversal. Comments like Mester’s contributed to a sharp fall in stock prices last month that began after Powell’s stern anti-inflation speech at the conference in Jackson Hole.
“Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,” Powell said then — a remark widely interpreted to mean that the Fed will fight inflation even if it requires deep job losses and a recession.
Many economists sound convinced that a recession and widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.

The Fed’s move boosted its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level since early 2008.
The officials also forecast that they will further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4.4% by year’s end, a full point higher than they had envisioned as recently as June. And they expect to raise the rate again next year, to about 4.6%. That would be the highest level since 2007.
By raising borrowing rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan. Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the economy and slowing inflation.

Falling gas prices have slightly lowered headline inflation, which was a still-painful 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier. Those declining prices at the gas pump might have contributed to a recent rise in President Joe Biden’s public approval ratings, which Democrats hope will boost their prospects in the November midterm elections.
Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said that before Fed officials would consider halting their rate hikes, they would “want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down” to their 2% target. He noted that the strength of the job market is fueling pay gains that are helping drive up inflation.
And he stressed his belief that curbing inflation is vital to ensuring the long-term health of the job market.
“If we want to light the way to another period of a very strong labor market,” Powell said, “we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there was painless way to do that. There isn’t.”
Fed officials have said they are seeking a “soft landing,” by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession. Yet most economists are skeptical. They say they think the Fed’s steep rate hikes will lead, over time, to job cuts, rising unemployment and a full-blown recession late this year or early next year.
“No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession, or if so, how significant that recession would be,” Powell said at his news conference. “That’s going to depend on how quickly we bring down inflation.”
In their updated economic forecasts, the Fed’s policymakers project that economic growth will remain weak for the next few years, with rising unemployment. They expect the jobless rate to reach 4.4% by the end of 2023, up from its current level of 3.7%. Historically, economists say, any time unemployment has risen by a half-point over several months, a recession has always followed.
Fed officials now foresee the economy expanding just 0.2% this year, sharply lower than their forecast of 1.7% growth just three months ago. And they envision sluggish growth below 2% from 2023 through 2025.
Even with the steep rate hikes the Fed foresees, it still expects core inflation — which excludes the volatile food and gas categories — to be 3.1% at the end of next year, well above its 2% target.
Powell acknowledged in a speech last month that the Fed’s moves will “bring some pain” to households and businesses. And he added that the central bank’s commitment to bringing inflation back down to its 2% target was “unconditional.”
Short-term rates at a level the Fed is now envisioning would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years, which helps explain why home sales have tumbled. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers’ steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession. On Sunday, Biden said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that he believed a soft landing for the economy was still possible, suggesting that his administration’s recent energy and health care legislation would lower prices for pharmaceuticals and health care.
The law may help lower prescription drug prices, but outside analyses suggest it will do little to immediately bring down overall inflation. Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office judged it would have a “negligible” effect on prices through 2023. The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model went even further to say “the impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero” over the next decade.
Even so, some economists are beginning to express concern that the Fed’s rapid rate hikes — the fastest since the early 1980s — will cause more economic damage than necessary to tame inflation. Mike Konczal, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, noted that the economy is already slowing and that wage increases — a key driver of inflation — are levelling off and by some measures even declining a bit.
Surveys also show that Americans are expecting inflation to ease significantly over the next five years. That is an important trend because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect inflation to ease, some will feel less pressure to accelerate their purchases. Less spending would then help moderate price increases.
The Fed’s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world’s second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government’s repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
Even at the Fed’s accelerated pace of rate hikes, some economists — and some Fed officials — argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Many economists sound convinced that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.
“The risk is that the Fed acts more aggressively in its mission to return inflation back to its 2% objective, pushing the funds rate higher than previously expected and keeping it higher for longer,’’ Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said Wednesday after the Fed’s meeting.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday again authorized one of the biggest interest rate hikes in 28 years as part of its effort to combat the quickest surge in prices in four decades—doubling down on a series of rate increases that is making a slew of debt offerings, including new mortgages, credit cards and some student loans, more expensive.

Key Facts
“Now is the time to aggressively pay down high-cost credit cards,” says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride, pointing out nearly all credit cards come with variable interest rates that fluctuate in tandem with the federal funds rate determined by the Fed. Fueled by the Fed’s hikes, mortgage rates have surged to the highest level since the Great Recession—climbing from nearly 3.8% at the beginning of the year to more than 6%, and pushing the average monthly mortgage payment up about $750, or 83%, compared to before the pandemic, according to Zillow. Many mortgage lending businesses have started suffering from sinking demand, and Marty Green, a principal with mortgage law firm Polunsky Beitel Green, notes the combination of higher home prices, increased interest rates and inflationary pressures has ""created an environment too uncertain for many borrowers to move forward in buying a home."" Nearly immediately after the Fed’s announcement on Wednesday, major banks—including Truist, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan—raised their prime interest rates, which are used to calculate loan costs, to 6.25%, compared to roughly 3.25% two years prior. Though federal student loans are doled out with fixed rates (meaning existing loans won’t be affected), private loans—which represent about 8% of the market with some $131 billion in loans outstanding—often come with variable rates that tick up after Fed hikes. One bright spot? “The outlook for savers is getting better,” says McBride, pointing out high-yielding savings accounts and certificates of deposit will raise payouts even though most banks “are likely to be stingy about passing along higher rates.”
Crucial Quote
“Rising interest rates mean borrowing costs more, and eventually savings will earn more,” says McBride, adding that households should be taking steps to “stabilize their finances,” including paying down costly credit cards and other variable-rate debt, and boosting emergency savings. “Both will enable you to better weather rising interest rates and whatever might come next economically.”
News Peg
At the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting Wednesday afternoon, Fed officials said the central bank would raise the federal funds rate, which is the target interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend reserves, by 75 basis points for the third month in a row—pushing the cost of borrowing up to the highest level since 2008.
Big Number
$16.2 trillion. That’s how much debt American households held at the end of the second quarter—the highest amount ever, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Though most of it is contained in fixed-rate housing debt, the overall figure has climbed at the quickest pace in 14 years as fast-rising home and auto prices helped tack more more than $1 trillion in debt over the past year.

In an attempt to rein in too-hot inflation, the Fed has tried to signal to investors and the financial markets its plans for tackling rapid price growth. In order for monetary policy and interest-rate hikes to work, the markets have to clearly grasp the Fed's goals and fall in line with those objectives. But recent communications from Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have been confused at best — and you only need to look at the market's considerable shifts over the summer to see that missteps have been made.
This is a problem not only for Powell and the Fed but for the economy. If investors stop listening to the Federal Reserve, even perfect decision-making by the Federal Open Market Committee — the Fed's main interest-rate-setting committee — can create a tragic misstep that is either too hawkish or too dovish. To actually deliver the desired amount of tightening and bring down inflation without losing control of the process, the Federal Reserve needs to clean up how it communicates with markets.
Playing the expectations game
Markets are by nature forward-looking, anticipating the future of a company or the next few years of economic growth. To move the economy toward the outcome it wants, the Fed plays on this future-focused nature by steering financial conditions. As economic conditions change, markets take into account what the Fed and other central banks will do next. By signaling future interest-rate cuts, the Fed hopes to send a signal that leads businesses to hire and invest while households spend more — boosting the economy. In signaling that interest-rate hikes are coming, the Fed is hoping to slow asset-price growth and sap confidence, lowering spending by consumers and businesses.
Using financial conditions to modulate the economy has proved supremely useful for the Fed in the past. After the global financial crisis, interest rates were already at zero, so there were limits to how much more the Fed could boost the economy. One solution was to telegraph the intention to keep interest rates low until the economy got on steadier footing, a strategy called forward guidance. Forward guidance meant markets could price in low rates long into the future, helping keep the stock market strong and mortgage rates low even though the Fed couldn't lower interest rates any further.
Other times, this signaling hasn't gone as well. When the Fed began hiking rates in 2004, private-sector debt costs actually got looser. From June 2004 to September 2005, both corporate bond yields and mortgage rates fell about half a percentage point while the Fed's main interest rate increased to 3.75% from 1%. The markets failed to get the picture, and as a result, the Fed's efforts to slow the economy and make the 2000s expansion more sustainable were a failure. That failure arguably made the global-financial-crisis recession much worse than it otherwise would have been.
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Nowadays the Fed and other central banks around the globe are trying to tell markets that they intend to tighten policy to get inflation under control. The result, in theory, is a cooling economy and lower prices. But instead of guiding the markets with clarity or useful ambiguity, the Fed has given them a heaping helping of confusion and contradiction this summer. Powell and other members of the FOMC have made statements that are mutually exclusive or wildly different from previous communications. That has allowed a dangerous wedge to form between what the Fed wants and what markets are expecting. Even grading on a curve, this summer has seen some remarkable communications errors that suggest a need for reflection about the communications approach.
Take, for instance, the June FOMC meeting: Despite the Fed signaling for weeks that they planned to raise rates by 0.50%, The Wall Street Journal reported days before the meeting that the FOMC was planning to raise rates by 0.75% instead — the biggest hike in rates at one meeting since 1994. In explaining the sudden shift, Powell pointed to a single survey that suggested Americans' expectations for future inflation were too high for comfort. But this survey had a sample of just a few hundred people and was later revised down, proving to be a false alarm.
Powell has flip-flopped on which measure of inflation the Fed is most closely watching: headline inflation, which includes goods that have volatile price changes like energy and food, or core inflation, which strips those categories out in an attempt to measure underlying price pressures. At the June meeting, Powell responded to a question about which type of inflation the Fed was targeting with a definitive ""inflation means headline inflation."" But a month later, as gas prices and food prices started to come back down, Powell pivoted and said that ""core is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward"" — the opposite of the stance he'd taken at the previous meeting.
Grizzled market watchers will probably roll their eyes at anyone who's disappointed when Fed officials talk out of either side of their mouths. But those same grizzled market watchers were likely confused by Powell's prepared remarks from the July FOMC meeting, when he said that ""it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases"" in interest rates. It's a logical statement of fact that the fastest pace of tightening in decades will not continue indefinitely. But by explicitly saying that, Powell gave markets an opening to assume much more.
These flip-flops have caused chaos for markets. Stock prices plunged after the mid-June meeting but soared after the subsequent meeting seemed to signal that the most intense rate hikes were over. The yield difference between risky and low-risk bonds also collapsed. That sounds like good news, but it actually represents a breakdown in the way monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy.
To correct the market's assumption that the worst of the rate hikes was in the past, Powell and other FOMC members spent weeks trying to convince investors that they were still committed to hiking rates to get inflation under control. At the annual economic-policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August, the chairman tried to reverse the jubilant market action of late July and early August by sternly reminding his audience that lowering inflation would require the Fed to ""bring some pain"" to the economy.
This isn't to say all markets haven't picked up on the Fed's path. Two-year note yields, which roughly proxy the market's pricing of the fed funds policy rate 12 months ahead, have risen steadily. While there have been fits and starts, the move from a rate of less than 0.75% at the end of last year to almost 4% today has been remarkably smooth and steady. But the orderly move in Treasury bonds compared with the back-and-forth chaos in stocks and corporate bonds only underlines the Fed's inability to lay out its plans.
The good news is that the bond market is confident the FOMC will succeed in bringing down inflation, and surveys of consumers and businesses suggest inflation expectations have dropped with gas prices over the past few months. The Fed is credible in the long run, but the FOMC is making its own life much harder by changing its script.
Clarity above all
There is one clear lesson for the FOMC from this summer: Communications are not working correctly. Explicit forecasts or specific focus points are being
punished by volatility and imbalanced positioning. Less communication in general would serve the Fed well.
Since I began tracking all publicly available comments from FOMC members in June 2017, a Fed speaker has talked in public more than once a day on average — and that excludes Fed minutes and policy decisions or similar press releases. Powell has also started giving eight interest-rate press conferences per year, twice as many as there were in 2018. If FOMC members said much less, it would offer much less room for confusion.
The Fed was served well by repeatedly and publicly discussing its policy approach when it was not under pressure to tighten rapidly. As the economy has shifted, so too has the Fed's communications imperative. Less is now more — and will be plenty to meet the goal of informing markets and the public without causing confusion.

WASHINGTON — Intensifying its fight against high inflation, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate Wednesday by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a third straight time and signaled more large rate hikes to come — an aggressive pace that will heighten the risk of an eventual recession.

On Wall Street, stock prices fell and bond yields rose in response to the Fed’s projection of further steep rate hikes ahead.
The central bank’s action Wednesday followed a government report last week that showed high costs spreading more broadly through the economy, with price spikes for rents and other services worsening even though some previous drivers of inflation, such as gas prices, have eased. By raising borrowing rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan. Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the economy and slowing inflation.
Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said that before Fed officials would consider halting their rate hikes, they would “want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down” to their 2 percent inflation target. He noted that the strength of the job market is fueling wage gains that are helping drive up inflation.
Fed officials have said they are seeking a “soft landing,” by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession. Yet economists increasingly say they think the Fed’s steep rate hikes will lead, over time, to job cuts, rising unemployment and a full-blown recession late this year or early next year.

In their updated economic forecasts, the Fed’s policymakers project that economic growth will remain weak for the next few years, with rising unemployment. It expects the jobless rate to reach 4.4 percent by the end of 2023, up from its current level of 3.7 percent. Historically, economists say, any time the unemployment rate has risen by a half-point over several months, a recession has always followed.
Fed officials now see the economy expanding just 0.2 percent this year, sharply lower than its forecast of 1.7 percent growth just three months ago. And it expects sluggish growth below 2 percent from 2023 through 2025.
And even with the steep rate hikes the Fed foresees, it still expects core inflation — which excludes the volatile food and gas categories — to be 3.1 percent at the end of next year, well above its 2 percent target.
Powell acknowledged in a speech last month that the Fed’s moves will “bring some pain” to households and businesses. And he added that the central bank’s commitment to bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent target was “unconditional.”
Falling gas prices have slightly lowered headline inflation, which was a still-painful 8.3 percent in August compared with a year earlier. Declining gas prices might have contributed to a recent rise in President Joe Biden’s public approval ratings, which Democrats hope will boost their prospects in the November midterm elections.

Short-term rates at a level the Fed is now envisioning would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. The economy hasn’t seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6 percent, its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers’ steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession. On Sunday, though, Biden said on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that he believed a soft landing for the economy was still possible, suggesting that his administration’s recent energy and health care legislation would lower prices for pharmaceuticals and health care.
Some economists are beginning to express concern that the Fed’s rapid rate hikes — the fastest since the early 1980s — will cause more economic damage than necessary to tame inflation. Mike Konczal, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, noted that the economy is already slowing and that wage increases – a key driver of inflation — are levelling off and by some measures even declining a bit.

Surveys also show that Americans are expecting inflation to ease significantly over the next five years. That is an important trend because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect inflation to ease, some will feel less pressure to accelerate their purchases. Less spending would then help moderate price increases.
Konczal said there is a case to be made for the Fed to slow its rate hikes over the next two meetings.
“Given the cooling that’s coming,” he said, “you don’t want to rush into this.”

WASHINGTON — Intensifying its fight against chronically high inflation, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate Wednesday by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a third straight time, an aggressive pace that is heightening the risk of an eventual recession.
Fed officials have said they’re seeking a “soft landing,” by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession. Yet economists increasingly say they think the Fed’s steep rate hikes will lead, over time, to job cuts, rising unemployment and a full-blown recession late this year or early next year.

68,The Fed wants you to lose your job,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,"Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, is wrongly insisting that aggressively raising interest rates will stop inflation, and he doesn’t seem to mind if that puts millions of people out of work.","“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation,” he said of the prospect of millions of people getting pink-slipped. And that’s indeed the likely outcome of his aggressive approach to tackling inflation by sharply raising interest rates, as the Fed did — yet again — Wednesday afternoon. With its latest announcement of the third consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike, the Fed is increasing interest rates at the fastest rate since the 1980s.
If there’s one good thing about this economy, it’s the labor market. Wages are rising, unemployment is down to near-historic lows , and workers have more leverage over their employers than they’re used to. But Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has had enough of that, and it seems he’d like to see you out of a job.

Let’s be clear: Unemployment is not an unintended byproduct of raising interest rates; it’s Powell’s goal. As the Fed’s main tool to fight inflation, higher interest rates help cool the economy because they make credit more expensive. That means people and companies are less likely to borrow money and spend it, leading to a dip in investment and overall demand for goods and services. And as companies anticipate, or eventually deal with, this decline in business, they start to reduce their overhead costs by laying workers off.

The more unemployment there is, the less money people will have to spend. Powell is presumably hoping that reducing demand this way would lead to lower prices. And that is generally how it works — the less demand there is for a given product, the less businesses can charge for it. But the problem in Powell’s calculus is that it assumes the supply of that product will remain constant, and given the current, extremely uncertain state of global supply chains, that is a bad assumption to make.
Advertisement
That’s why aggressively raising interest rates in this particular economy is the wrong course of action. While high demand is certainly contributing to inflation, so too are supply shocks. And no matter what Powell does, there is nothing he can do to ease supply chain bottlenecks. What that means is that even if there is a spike in unemployment — and a consequent drop in aggregate demand — that won’t necessarily lead to lower inflation. In fact, it means that the United States could enter a prolonged period of high unemployment and high inflation, the worst possible combination for middle- and low-income households.
And yet Powell is acting as if interest rates are like an efficient central air conditioner — just dial up the thermostat and instantly feel the temperature change. But raising interest rates in this economy is more like having Powell turn on a single dinky old window unit and expecting it to cool his entire house. (Oh, and by the way, that old window unit could blow a fuse and cause a power outage at any moment. The Fed, in other words, could help trigger a global recession, as the World Bank has warned.)
Powell should know this, which is why it’s mind boggling that he is insisting to go down this road. It’s true that maintaining price stability is part of the Fed’s mandate, but so is maximum employment. It’s clear that Powell prioritizes the former, so much so that he is willing to accept job losses in the bargain. And that’s unfortunate because as bad as it is, the inflation Americans are currently experiencing is still far more manageable and less painful than high unemployment.

So what should the Fed do? Raising interest rates is a fine step, but it has to be done much more incrementally in order to reduce the risks of catastrophic unemployment. More importantly, Powell must accept that his goal of keeping the inflation rate at 2 percent is unrealistic in the near term. That has long been the Fed’s inflation target, but current circumstances call for some degree of tolerance for higher prices — not permanently, to be sure, but until the global economy, supply chains, and energy prices become more stable. Maintaining a strong labor market is well worth it.
This is not to say that the Fed ought to be complacent. And if the inflation rate rises significantly, then obviously Powell could adjust his posture accordingly. But so long as that’s not the case, there’s no reason for him to be overly proactive, especially since there have been signs, albeit mixed, that inflation might be easing. Until there is more clarity on how inflation is trending, it’s safe to assume that Powell knows that his actions might unnecessarily cost you your job. He just doesn’t seem to care.

69,Fed Attacks Inflation with Another Big Hike and Expects More,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a third straight time and signaled more large rate hikes to come.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Intensifying its fight against high inflation, the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate Wednesday by a substantial three-quarters of a point for a third straight time and signaled more large rate hikes to come — an aggressive pace that will heighten the risk of an eventual recession.
The Fed’s move boosted its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level since early 2008.
The officials also forecast that they will further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4.4% by year’s end, a full percentage point higher than they had forecast as recently as June. And they expect to raise the rate further next year, to about 4.6%. That would be the highest level since 2007.
The central bank’s action Wednesday followed a government report last week that showed high costs spreading more broadly through the economy. By raising borrowing rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan. Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the economy and slowing inflation.
Speaking at a news conference, Chair Jerome Powell said that before Fed officials would consider halting their rate hikes, they would “want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down” to their 2% inflation target. He noted that the strength of the job market is fueling wage gains that are helping drive up inflation.
Fed officials have said they are seeking a “soft landing,” by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession. Yet most economists say they think the Fed’s steep rate hikes will lead, over time, to job cuts, rising unemployment and a full-blown recession late this year or early next year.
“No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession, or if so, how significant that recession would be,” Powell said at his news conference. “That’s going to depend on how quickly we bring down inflation.”
In their updated economic forecasts, the Fed’s policymakers project that economic growth will remain weak for the next few years, with rising unemployment. It expects the jobless rate to reach 4.4% by the end of 2023, up from its current level of 3.7%. Historically, economists say, any time the unemployment rate has risen by a half-point over several months, a recession has always followed.
Fed officials now see the economy expanding just 0.2% this year, sharply lower than its forecast of 1.7% growth just three months ago. And it expects sluggish growth below 2% from 2023 through 2025.
And even with the steep rate hikes the Fed foresees, it still expects core inflation — which excludes the volatile food and gas categories — to be 3.1% at the end of next year, well above its 2% target.

73,How to Invest While Federal Reserve Interest Rates Remain High,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri says the Fed won't cut interest rates until 2024 at earliest. Here's how to invest in a market rocked by rate hikes.,"All eyes are on the Federal Reserve to see how high Jerome Powell raises interest rates.
BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri expects a 75 basis-point hike, and thinks rates won't be cut until 2024.
She says investors should buy high-quality stocks in defensive sectors, plus inflation-linked bonds.
From enduring supply chain bottlenecks to the collapse of tech stocks to a mounting European energy crisis, the market has faced its fair share of disruptions in 2022. But so far, none of these headwinds have quite matched the trail of devastation left in the wake of raging inflation.
That's according to Gargi Chaudhuri, head of investment strategy at BlackRock's iShares Americas unit, which currently manages around $2.13 trillion in assets. ""Inflation will continue to be front and center of what's driving markets,"" she told Insider in a recent interview.
With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubling down on his resolve to tame inflation at last month's Jackson Hole meeting, Chaudhuri believes that a 75-basis point rate hike looks likely at the September FOMC meeting. Although some investors have priced in a 100-basis point hike, raising rates any higher than 75 basis points could agitate the market rather than convey the intended signal of assurance.
""They want to sound resolute but not panicked,"" she explained, also highlighting that the Federal Reserve wants to allow for the lag in time it generally takes for its policy actions to trickle down throughout the economy. This means that the full extent of the central bank's monetary tightening actions — including its current balance sheet reduction — and their effects on potentially slowing consumer demand or inducing a recession won't be felt for at least several months to come.
Don't expect rate cuts until at least 2024
Given the central bank's hardline hawkish stance, Chaudhuri thinks that there's virtually no chance that rates will be cut anytime in 2023.
""In the past, easing policy too quickly after raising it hasn't been the right course of action,"" she explained.
""Then when and if the economy slows down — and we'll obviously begin to see signs of that in the data — that's when they begin to cut rates, and I would imagine that the dot plot shows that taking place in 2024,"" Chaudhuri continued, adding that she expects a rate cut of at least 50 basis points to be priced in by 2025.
Buy high-quality defensive stocks and front-end bonds
As higher rates endure for at least the next year, Chaudhuri believes investors will continue to see certain ""pockets of weakness"" in the real economy.
""I think that becomes harder for certain parts of the market — especially certain sectors of the equity market — but it also creates pockets of value for the fixed income market,"" she said. In the coming months, she urged investors to prioritize keeping their portfolios safe from increased volatility.
Within fixed income, Chaudhuri emphasized that attractive opportunities for investors lie within shorter duration bonds, which currently have a high carry, meaning that investors will earn an attractive return simply for buying and holding onto these front-end assets. Because the yield curve remains inverted at the moment, investors can actually earn higher yields on shorter-term bonds than those with longer maturities, while simultaneously taking on less exposure to interest rate risks.
Specifically, Chaudhuri recommended investors consider short-duration bonds like 1, 2, and 3-year US Treasuries, 1 through 5-year investment-grade corporate bonds, and front-end inflation-linked bonds.
As for equity allocations, Chaudhuri advised investors to position defensively by buying high quality assets that are more resilient to a recession. ""Low or minimum volatility stocks give you more downside protection, which reduces your risk in the portfolio,"" she explained.
Sector-wise, the highest-quality assets fall into the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, since both are traditionally more resistant to economic downturns and have strong power to generate cash flows. Chaudhuri recommended these two industries rather than consumer staples, a sector that traditionally fares well during recessions but may not necessarily outperform in this particular high-inflation environment, which she said might cut into company profit margins.
""Healthcare is more attractively priced and will still give you that quality, which means that those companies are likely to do a little bit better even if inflation continues to be persistent into next year,"" said Chaudhuri.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-interest-rates-how-to-invest-stock-market-blackrock-2022-9
74,Federal Reserve interest rate hike: Highest level in 14 years expected,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,The Fed is expected to raise its short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for the third straight time.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Last month, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he issued a blunt warning: The Fed’s drive to curb inflation by aggressively raising interest rates, he said, would “bring some pain” for Americans.
When the Fed ends its latest meeting Wednesday and Powell holds a news conference, Americans will likely get a better idea of how much pain could be in store.
The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate by a substantial three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time. Another hike that large would boost its benchmark rate — which affects many consumer and business loans — to a range of 3% to 3.25%, the highest level in 14 years.
Many Fed watchers, though, will be paying particular attention to Powell’s words at a news conference afterward. His remarks will be parsed for any hint of whether the Fed expects to moderate its rate hikes in the coming months — or instead to continue tightening credit significantly until it’s convinced that inflation is on its way down.
In a further sign of the Fed’s deepening concern about inflation, it will also likely signal Wednesday that it plans to raise rates much higher by year’s end than it had forecast three months ago — and to keep them higher for longer. Economists expect Fed officials to forecast that their key rate could go as high as 4% before the new year. They’re also likely to signal additional hikes in 2023, perhaps to as high as roughly 4.5%.
Short-term rates at that level would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages, car loans and business loans. The Fed intends those higher borrowing costs to slow growth by cooling a still-robust job market to cap wage growth and other inflation pressures. Yet the risk is growing that the Fed may weaken the economy so much as to cause a downturn that would produce heavy job losses.
The economy hasn’t seen rates as high as the Fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6%, its highest point in 14 years. Credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com.
Powell and other Fed officials still say the Fed’s goal is to achieve a “soft landing,” by which they would slow the economy enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession.
By last week, though, that goal appeared further out of reach after the government reported that inflation over the past year was a painful 8.3%. Even worse, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose much faster than expected.
The inflation report also documented just how broadly inflation has spread through the economy, complicating the the Fed’s task. Inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers’ steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession.
“They’re going try to avoid recession,” said William Dudley, formerly the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “The problem is that the room to do that is virtually non-existent at this point.”
The Fed’s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking, contributing to concerns about a potential global recession. The European Central Bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point. The Bank of England, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks.
And in China, the world’s second-largest economy, growth is already suffering from the government’s repeated COVID lockdowns. If recession sweeps through most large economies, that could derail the U.S. economy, too.
At his news conference Wednesday, Powell isn’t likely to drop any hints that the central bank will ease up on its credit tightening campaign. Most economists expect the Fed to stop raising rates in early 2023. But for now, they expect Powell to reinforce his hard-line anti-inflation stance.
“It’s going to end up being a hard landing,” said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics.
“He’s not going to say that,” Bostjancic said. But, referring to the most recent Fed meeting in July, when Powell raised hopes for an eventual pullback on rate hikes, she added: “He also wants to make sure that the markets don’t come away and rally. That’s what happened last time.”
Indeed, investors responded then by bidding up stock prices and buying bonds, which lowered rates on securities like the benchmark the 10-year Treasury. Higher stock prices and lower bond yields generally boost the economy — the opposite of what the Fed wants.
The central bank has already engaged in the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s. Yet some economists — and some Fed officials — argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth.
Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank, and one of the 12 officials who will vote on the Fed’s decision Wednesday, said she thinks it will be necessary to raise the Fed’s rate to “somewhat above 4% by early next year and hold it there.”
“I do not anticipate the Fed cutting” rates next year, Mester added, dispelling the expectations of many investors on Wall Street who had hoped for such a reversal. Comments like Mester’s contributed to a sharp fall in stock prices last month that began after Powell’s stern anti-inflation speech at the conference in Jackson Hole.
“Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,” Powell said then — a remark widely interpreted to mean that the Fed will fight inflation even if it requires deep job losses and a recession.
Many economists sound convinced that a recession and widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. Research published earlier this month under the auspices of the Brookings Institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7.5% to get inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.
Only a downturn that harsh would reduce wage growth and consumer spending enough to cool inflation, according to the a paper by Johns Hopkins University economist Laurence Ball and two economists at the International Monetary Fund.",https://fortune.com/2022/09/21/how-high-federal-reserve-interest-rate-hikes-jerome-powell-three-quarters-75-basis-points/
75,Fed interest rate hikes hurt first-time homebuyers,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,The Federal Reserve raising interest rates to combat inflation and slow down the economy could be a blow to first-time homebuyers.,"First-time home buyers are working against all odds to land their dream home amid skyrocketing housing prices, low availability, fierce competition, and ever-increasing mortgage interest rates.
Today’s news won’t help. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by another 0.75% Wednesday, the fifth hike this year, in an attempt to ease inflation. That will affect adjustable-rate mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and potentially boost mortgage rates for 15- and 30-year fixed loans indirectly.
“Inflation is still running hot and is not easing as fast as expected,” Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said in a statement.
The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped to 6.47% this week. That’s the highest since 2008, and is more than double the average rate from a year ago.
Housing, especially rent, is one of the largest drivers of the inflation increase, which hit 8.3% in August compared to a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While price increases for things like gasoline and airfares are slowing, housing costs are actually increasing at an accelerating rate.
This is especially harmful for home buyers because inflation and high mortgage rates are working to dwindle their purchasing power. When rates rise, the same home will cost buyers more than it would have at a lower interest rate, forcing first-time buyers to rejigger their budgets, says John Cooper, a certified financial planner and former mortgage lender in South Carolina.
Some are priced out completely, while others lose their mortgage eligibility when they can no longer meet lenders’ strict debt-to-income ratios.
For instance, a 30-year mortgage rate of 3% on a $350,000 house with a 3.5% down payment has a monthly mortgage payment of $1,423, not including taxes and fees. All else the same, a 6.5% mortgage rate increases your monthly payment to $2,134, equating to an additional $255,960 over the life of the loan, according to Bankrate.
First-time homebuyers with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans are also facing higher rates. The 30-year fixed rate mortgages backed by the FHA—which are intended to help low- and moderate-income first-time buyers by lowering down payments and closing costs—increased from 5.61% last week to 5.71%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s weekly survey.
All this said, buyers dropping out of the market could be a boon for first-time buyers who can afford to keep shopping the limited inventory.
What first-time homebuyers can do now
This monthly price difference has many potential buyers questioning whether they should try to buy now—or wait for lower rates. No one can time the market, but things may get better for buyers, if they can afford rising rents.
“My belief is that mortgage rates will be lower in 12 to 24 months,” says Cooper. “If a homebuyer is willing to wait, the mortgage environment most likely will improve, meaning lower interest rates, during that time.”
Since first-time buyers don’t have equity from a home sale to compete with repeat buyers, they can also use this time as an opportunity to save up a larger down payment. If they can save 20% of the purchase amount, buyers can avoid taking out private mortgage insurance which could save the buyer hundreds of dollars each month, says Cooper.
While today’s news might seem like more discouragement for first-time buyers in an already stressful market, those still set on purchasing their dream home should consider applying for a mortgage pre-approval to show that they are a serious and prepared buyer, says Tom Goyda, senior vice president of consumer lending for Wells Fargo.
A pre-approval can also give the buyer a more accurate idea of their potential loan amount, monthly payment, and interest rate so they can begin budgeting for their monthly expenses.
Overall, the most important thing a buyer can do is make sure they can comfortably afford their monthly mortgage payments.",https://fortune.com/2022/09/21/fed-september-interest-rate-hike-first-time-homebuyers/

77,Dollar Hits 20-Year High After Putin Mobilizes Troops And Threatens Nuclear War,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is also expected to hike interest rates later on Wednesday, which could further rattle markets.","Topline
The U.S. dollar leapt to a new 20-year high on Wednesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin drafted 300,000 reservists to bolster his flagging invasion of Ukraine and threatened to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia’s interests, a major escalation that has rocked markets as Moscow prepares to annex swathes of occupied territory.

Key Facts
The Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar’s value against six other major currencies, jumped nearly 0.6% to 110.87 following the news on Wednesday, its highest level since 2002. European currencies fared less well, however, with Britain’s pound sterling falling as much as 0.7% against the dollar and dropping to a 37-year low. The euro, which fell below parity with the dollar this summer, fell 0.7% to a two-week low. Safe haven assets also jumped following the news, with the Japanese yen adding 0.3% against the dollar and gold jumping 0.6%.
What To Watch For
The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a sharp hike in interest rates on Wednesday in an attempt to contain soaring inflation. It is also expected to announce further plans to hike the rate in coming months, in line with central banks around the world that are also fighting rising inflation and a mounting cost of living crisis.
News Peg
Putin announced plans for “partial mobilization” of army reserves in a televised address on Wednesday morning, doubling down on the invasion after weeks of setbacks and successful counter offensives from Ukrainian forces. It is Russia’s first mobilization effort since World War 2 and a clear sign from the Kremlin that the invasion is not going according to plan. It follows reports of heavy losses, stunning retreats, swathes of lost territory and serious supply chain issues as global sanctions bite down on the Russian economy. Putin framed the invasion as a fight pitting Russia against the West and set the stage to formally annex parts of Ukraine. He acknowledged a series of upcoming referendums in occupied territories to join Russia as legitimate, contrary to Kyiv and Western allies, who have suggested they will not recognize any vote or annexation stemming from them. Putin reiterated threats that Moscow would defend its interests by any means, including with nuclear weapons, stating that he was not bluffing and that Russia has “lots of weapons” with which to respond to threats.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Wednesday, bouncing after the previous session’s losses, as investors await another jumbo interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve and clues to the future path of monetary tightening.
At 07:00 ET (11:00 GMT), the contract was up 100 points, or 0.3%, traded 10 points, or 0.3% higher, and climbed 10 points, or 0.1%.

“The release of the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ will be key in determining the market reaction on Wednesday, with investors to pay close attention to the median dot for 2022, and the bank’s expectation for the terminal rate,” said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury. “We expect both to be shifted relatively markedly higher.”

79,Mohamed El-Erian: odds of a ‘soft landing’ for the U.S. economy are now ‘uncomfortably low’,2022-09-21T04:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve is stuck in a no-win situation, and the public will see “significant collateral damage and unintended adverse consequences” as a result, El-Erian says.","Mohamed El-Erian has spent the past two years criticizing the Federal Reserve for what he calls a series of missteps that have put the U.S. economy in a no-win scenario.
The economist says that by downplaying inflation as “transitory” and maintaining near-zero interest rates even after the economy recovered from the pandemic, the Fed has let price increases become entrenched.
This has left Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t” situation, El-Erian, who is president of Queens’ College at Cambridge University and chief economic advisor at Allianz, argued in a CNN op-ed on Wednesday.
The Fed can either continue raising interest rates to fight inflation, even as the economy slows, thereby increasing the odds of an outright recession. Or, it can choose to ease its fight against inflation in hopes of avoiding a recession, raising the chances that consumers are stuck with higher prices for the foreseeable future.
In either scenario, El-Erian argues there will be “significant collateral damage and unintended adverse consequences” for the public.
And he isn’t the only Wall Street veteran to claim the Fed is playing catch-up after making mistakes last year.
“The Fed was late to recognize inflation, late to start raising interest rates, and late to start unwinding bond purchases. They’ve been playing catch-up ever since. And they’re not done yet,” Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, told Fortune.
All of this means that the likelihood of the U.S. economy avoiding a recession is falling fast, El-Erian said.
“Unfortunately the probability of a ‘soft landing’ — that is, reducing inflation without much damage to growth — has become uncomfortably low,” he told Fortune.
Backing up El-Erian’s point, Morning Consult’s chief economist, John Leer, noted that Fed officials this week “significantly increased” their projections for inflation and unemployment over the next two years, while simultaneously lowering their economic growth forecasts.
“Even the Fed is growing less confident in its ability to achieve a soft landing,” he told Fortune.
A global growth slowdown
El-Erian’s argument for why the U.S. economy is unlikely to achieve a soft landing is based not only on the Fed’s need to raise interest rates aggressively to combat inflation, but also on the idea that the entire global economy is experiencing a slowdown.
He points to the fact that all three of the world’s largest economies are struggling, and developing countries like Sri Lanka and Argentina are experiencing unsustainable inflation rates.
“Among the three most systemically-important economies, Europe is facing the near-certainty of a recession, China is growing well below historical averages, and the U.S. risks being tipped into recession by a late Federal Reserve. This is likely to add fuel to the little fires already burning in some developing countries,” El-Erian told Fortune.
To his point, Europe’s energy crisis has deteriorated in recent weeks, leading Deutsche Bank to argue the bloc is now headed for a severe recession.
And at the same time, investment banks have repeatedly slashed their forecasts for economic growth in China, as the country copes with a property crisis while its zero-COVID policies continue to shutter factories and hinder consumer spending.
On top of that, China faced a record heatwave over the summer and is still dealing with a drought that has crippled its supply chains.
Growth isn’t just falling in China and Europe, however. Economists at major institutions like the World Bank and Bank of America have cut their forecasts for global economic growth substantially in recent months.
And sinking growth in every major economy coupled with central banks simultaneously raising interest rates is a recipe for disaster, according to El-Erian.
The economist’s comments echo statements made by World Bank Vice President Ayhan Kose earlier this week after the organization released a new study about the rising potential for a global recession.
Kose argued that because central banks worldwide are hiking interest rates simultaneously, the effects could be “mutually compounding.” That means a “global growth slowdown” is all but guaranteed, and a “global recession” is a growing possibility.",https://fortune.com/2022/09/21/top-economist-mohamed-el-erian-recession-likely-soft-landing-uncomfortably-low/

83,One number could be the key to how markets trade right after Fed meets,2022-09-21T02:19:07Z,The bond market is waiting for Federal Reserve officials to reveal how high they think interest rates will ultimately go.,"The bond market is waiting for Federal Reserve officials to reveal how high they think interest rates will go. The reaction to that forecast will also have a profound impact on stocks, which have struggled as rates have risen in anticipation of a more aggressive Fed. The latest Fed forecast for a terminal rate — or high water mark in interest rates — will be unveiled in quarterly economic projections released at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. That is when the Fed is expected to announce that will it will raise its target fed funds rate by 75 basis points, though there is some speculation it could move as much as a full percentage point. (A basis point equals 0.01 of a percent) Besides the rate hike, the market is intently focused on the terminal rate. That projection is included in the Fed's interest rate forecast. Currently, the Fed has its end rate at about 3.8% for 2023, based on its June projections. Those forecasts are shaped by the collective estimates of Fed officials, which are kept anonymous. On Tuesday, the futures market was pricing in a 4.5% terminal rate by next April, but economists' views are widely varied on where the Fed's interest rate campaign might peak. Some expect closer to a 4% end rate, while others expect it to be as high as 5%. With a three-quarters point hike Wednesday, the fed funds rate range will move up to 3% to 3.25%. ""If we find that 4.25% is the terminal rate for the fed funds rate, I think investors will breath a sigh of relief because it could have been much worse,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The terminal rate has become a keen focus of investors, particularly since a report on hotter-than-expected August consumer inflation upended views of how aggressive the Fed will have to be. That report sent bond yields sharply higher, and that in turn hurt stocks. The consumer price index showed that inflation continued to rise in August, while economists expected it to decline slightly. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 3.55% Tuesday afternoon, after touching a high of 3.6%. The 2-year yield was at 3.96%, after rising as high as 4%. Expectations for the Fed's terminal rate also soared. Before the August CPI report, the futures market was pricing in a terminal rate at just about 4% for next April. As rates jumped, stocks have fallen since the Sept. 13 report. Fed dance ""If you could call this a Fed dance, the bond market is leading,"" said Stovall. ""The Fed is the tempo of the music. If the Fed sounds more aggressive, they're speeding it up and that could, I think, cause the markets and the economy to fall out of step."" Yields on both the 2- and 10-year notes moved lower after the last three Fed rate hikes — in May, June and July — according to Wells Fargo's Michael Schumacher. At the March meeting where the Fed first raised rates from zero, yields rose slightly. Yields move opposite to price, and a lower yield is viewed as better for stocks. Stocks moved higher after every Fed hike this year, going back to March, when the Fed first raised interest rates, according to data from Bespoke. ""I think bonds are driving stocks right now,"" said Schumacher. He pointed to the jump in bond yields after the hot CPI report. In the futures market, ""the terminal rate went up 40 basis points in 24 hours,"" he said. ""Stocks just got bludgeoned."" Higher for longer Schumacher said Powell is likely to stress that the Fed will hold rates higher for longer, and not reverse course by cutting rates later next year, as some in the market expect. That's important because higher for longer means the economy will be facing rates at the terminal level for longer, not the lower yields many expect. There is also a risk that Powell veers to the dovish side, by offering scenarios where the Fed could slow down interest rate hikes, said Schumacher. ""The Fed will clarify...that we're going to go up into the 4s [on fed funds] and stay there. But are they going to pound the idea of a hard landing?"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""And do they think they need much slower growth or is it going to be more of, do [they] slow down and become more cautious as we move into more restrictive territory?"" Strategists say the Fed may forecast a terminal rate, but that rate will probably not be where its cycle ends since the outlook for inflation and the economy are unclear. The end rate could be either higher or lower. Tipp said there's about a 50% chance the Fed will never raise rates above 4% because of economic weakness that is already showing up in the housing market. Bond strategists are divided on what this means for the outlook for the benchmark 10-year yield, which influences mortgages, car loans and other lending rates. ""The price action is in anticipation of a hawkish Fed, but it isn't representative of what we're going to see at the end of the week,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. ""We expect the 10-year yield to end lower."" The Fed is likely to clarify a lot of issues, including that it does not intend to raise rates to 5%, as some expect, Lyngen said. ""I think the market is nervous the Fed feels so behind the curve, they're going to do something way outside the box,"" he said. But NatWest Markets expects the Fed could indeed have a terminal rate of 5%. ""I think there's partially recognition that rates are going to have to go up further than we thought and stay there longer than we thought,"" said NatWest's John Briggs. ""What if inflation is stickier?...A 10-year yield at 4% is not that crazy.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/one-number-could-be-the-key-to-how-markets-trade-right-after-fed-meets.html

Rate futures traders are pricing in an 81% chance of a 75-basis-point hike from the Federal Reserve
NEW YORK, USA – Global stocks fell on Tuesday, September 20, while the yield on 2-year US Treasury notes rose to almost a 15-year high as investors prepared for the likelihood of another 75-basis-point (bps) interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The Fed is set to announce its decision on Wednesday, September 21, at the end of a two-day policy meeting. Rate futures traders are pricing in an 81% chance of a 75-bps hike and a 19% probability of 100 bps of tightening.
Britain, Norway, Switzerland, and Japan also have monetary policy meetings this week.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury shot to 3.604% before paring some gains. They were up 8 basis points to 3.569% after topping 3.5% for the first time in 11 years on Monday, September 19.
The Fed and other banks are trying to take an aggressive stance to tackle inflation, but investors have also worried about the impact of higher rates on the global economy.
On Wall Street, investors were cautious of making new bets.
“Investors are just selling the Fed,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “All of the bad that was ignored, we’re getting all of that back. People are pessimistic.”

The dollar index was on track for its fifth weekly gain in six and was last up 0.5% at 110.13. It hit 110.79 this month for the first time since June 2002.
“Traders and investors are taking cover, aware that the dollar is behaving like a force of nature, and unwilling to face its wrath,” said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.
The rate hike by Sweden’s central bank was larger than analysts had expected, causing the Swedish crown to briefly spike against the euro and dollar.
Hikes from the Bank of England and Swiss central bank are expected on Thursday, September 22.

Fed's Powell to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to lift interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for a third straight time and signal how much further and how fast borrowing costs may need to rise to tame a potentially corrosive outbreak of inflation.
The policy decision, due to be announced at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will mark the latest move in a synchronized policy shift by global central banks that is testing the resilience of the world's economy and the ability of countries to manage exchange rate shocks as the value of the dollar soars.
While investors largely expect the Fed to lift its policy rate by 75 basis points to the 3.00%-3.25% range, markets could be unsettled by the updated quarterly economic projections that will be released along with the policy statement.

Those projections will show where Fed policymakers think interest rates are heading, how long it will take inflation to fall, and how much ""pain"" is likely to be inflicted on U.S. employment and economic growth along the way.
If the past few months are any prologue, that rewritten economic script will point to a tougher-than-expected fight ahead, with a federal funds rate that may top 4% by the end of 2022, versus the 3.4% that was expected when the last set of projections were issued in June, and rising unemployment.
""With little evidence in hand that inflation pressures are abating, (Chair Jerome Powell) is likely to re-emphasize the Fed's commitment to do what is necessary to bring inflation to target, even if that means risking a recession,"" Deutsche Bank economists wrote late last week. ""They will ... foresee tighter monetary policy and greater pain in the labor market.""
Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. central bank to eventually need to raise its policy rate to around 5.00%, a level approaching the peak of 5.25% seen from mid-2006 to 2007 when Fed policymakers were concerned about a bubble in the U.S. housing market, and one that could amplify stress across the global financial system.
Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. to elaborate on the latest policy decision, and his tone will shape whether it is interpreted as a hawkish next step with more of the same ahead, or as a final bit of rate-hike ""front-loading"" before the Fed reverts to more conventional rate increases of 50 or 25 basis points as it feel its way to a stopping point.
Powell has had to correct himself in real time about the Fed's likely path twice this year. In June, after he largely ruled out hiking rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, a surprise jump in inflation unnerved the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee and pushed its members towards the larger increase. In July, Powell's comment that the Fed might move to smaller incremental rate increases was read as indicating an imminent policy pivot.
The Fed chief's tone since then has become ardently hawkish, and, with the central bank's preferred measure of inflation running more than three times its 2% target, another dose of tough talk is anticipated.
""Risks still skew toward higher terminal policy rates and we expect a relatively hawkish FOMC meeting,"" Citi economists wrote on Tuesday.

'PRESENT DANGER'
The hawkish stance has become the norm globally as central bankers dial up interest rate moves not seen since the 1990s, at the tail end of a fight in the developed world against inflation that had become entrenched in the 1970s.
The European Central Bank, following the Fed, earlier this month raised its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point for the first time ever; Sweden's central bank this week approved its first full-percentage-point increase in 30 years.
The Bank of England and the central banks of Switzerland and Norway will meet this week, with markets expecting them to announce large rate hikes.
Such increases in borrowing costs can feed off each other, changing currency, price and trade dynamics in ways that prompt other central banks to react, particularly in emerging markets where exchange rate fluctuations and rising dollar interest rates can cause unexpected financial shocks.
Led by the Fed's intensifying focus on fighting inflation, the tightening has become so pronounced that some have begun worrying about overkill.
""Central banks nearly everywhere feel accused of being on the back foot,"" in failing to anticipate to prevent the jump of inflation in 2021, Maurice Obstfeld, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote in an essay last week published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The present danger, however, is not so much that current and planned moves will fail eventually to quell inflation. It is that they collectively go too far and drive the world economy into an unnecessarily harsh contraction.""
Between the aftershocks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Bank President David Malpass warned last week that the global economy could be approaching ""a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.""
