U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in September, suggesting demand for labour remained strong, while a separate measure of private-sector employment showed more expansion in October than economists had previously forecast.
Investors widely expect the Fed to raise rates by another 75 basis points (bps) to 3.75%-4.00%. Money markets show U.S. rates are likely to peak in the first half of 2023 at 4.75-5.00%. The European Central Bank (ECB), meanwhile, just raised rates to 1.5% and is expected to finish its tightening cycle in just under a year, when rates could reach 2.8%. ""We expect the 10-year Bund yield to be at 2.25-2.5% by the end of the year,"" said Rohan Khanna, research strategist at UBS.
""We see the euro area's inflation at around 10% in the next two or three months, which means that the ECB will find it hard to signal a slowdown in its monetary tightening path,"" he added. The U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will issue a statement at 1800 GMT, and Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference half an hour later.
Yields on the German benchmark Bund yield were virtually unchanged on the day at 2.13%, as were those on the two-year Schatz, which held at 1.969%. On the supply front, the German central bank topped up a 10-year ""green"" Bund for an average yield of 2.07%, up from a previous yield of 1.05% and just managed to attract enough bids to cover the auction.
Green debt has struggled this year, as soaring energy prices have knocked climate-friendly investing further down asset managers' agendas, in some cases, and rising interest rates have generally weighed heavily on fixed income. ""That big charge into ESG-type debt has been one of the graveyard trades for this year. A lot of green debt has performed very badly,"" ADM Investor Services chief global economist Marc Ostwald said.
Euro area data on Wednesday painted a bleak picture, after manufacturing activity contracted more sharply than initially estimated in October and pointed to a sector in recession. Italy's 10-year government bond yield also held steady at 4.292%, leaving the premium to German 10-year debt yields at 215 bps.

The PSE index, the 30-company benchmark of the Philippine Stock Exchange, lost 50 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 6,156.11 as four of the six subsectors declined.
The broader all-share index also gave back 19 points, or 0.6 percent, to settle at 3,257.83, on a value turnover of P4.5 billion. Losers outnumbered gainers, 114 to 61, while 37 issues were unchanged.
Four of the 10 most active stocks ended in the green, led by International Container Terminal Services Inc. which climbed 5.8 percent to P172.00 and Semirara Mining and Power Corp. which rose 4.3 percent to P35.35.
The peso also depreciated to 58.80 against the US dollar Thursday, from Wednesday’s 58.47 following the Fed’s announcement. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said it would match the Fed’s 75-basis-point adjustment in its own overnight borrowing rate.

Asian and European markets also sank Thursday. Equities have rallied for more than a week on speculation the US central bank would join others in tamping down its monetary-tightening campaign as the economy showed signs of slowing.
The Fed bank unveiled a fourth straight 75 basis-point increase—the sixth hike this year—and opened the door to a smaller increase at future meetings, giving a boost to Wall Street.
But Powell soon after sent traders scattering when he told a news conference that while it would be appropriate to lessen the size of the hikes, “incoming data since our last meeting suggests that ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected”.
He added that “we still have some ways” until borrowing costs were at the necessary level and that it “is very premature to be thinking about pausing”.
And while there is a building fear that the increasingly tight monetary conditions will send the world’s top economy into a recession, the Fed boss said it would take time for the effects of the measures to kick in.
“The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he warned. “We will stay the course, until the job is done.”
Investors now expect rates to top out at more than five percent, compared with four percent currently.
The comments hammered the narrative that had supported stocks, sending Wall Street’s three main indexes tanking – led by rate-sensitive tech giants—and pushing the dollar up against its peers.
“Every time the market gets a little bit of dovish hope, it gets smacked on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper,” Scott Rundell of Mutual Ltd said. “There’s a lot of volatility still ahead.”
Hong Kong led the losses as the city’s central bank hiked rates in line with the Fed, owing to their policy link via the dollar peg.
Traders gave back a chunk of the previous two days’ gains, which came on the back of speculation China was planning to roll back some of its painful zero-Covid policies. Adding to the selling was confirmation from Beijing’s health authority that it intended to stick to the strategy.

Nov. 2 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve, in an effort to end persistent U.S. inflation, is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday by another 0.75 percentage points, or 75 basis points. ""Interest rates have risen at a whiplash-inducing speed, and we're not done yet,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""It's going to take some time for inflation to come down from these lofty levels, even once we do start to see some improvement."" Advertisement
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will attend a press briefing Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. EDT to discuss the rate hikes and continuing efforts to lower inflation. Wednesday's expected hike would be the fourth consecutive 75-basis-point hike this year and would bring the federal funds rate to the range of 3.74% to 4%, up from zero to 0.25% in March.
Markets are bracing for the rate hike, and according to CNBC, the Fed is expected to signal that it could begin decreasing the size of the interest rate increases in December and end them at 5% in March.
The most recent interest rate hike by the Fed was in September. Powell said then that the central bank was resolved to restore price stability, which is ""the bedrock of our economy.""

A Bureau of Economic Analysis report released last week showed inflation continuing at a high rate in September, with the personal consumption expenditures index rising 6.2% from a year ago.

""So in reality, the market already thinks this is happening, and from my point of view, there's no way the outcome of his press conference is going to be more dovish than that.""

NEW YORK (AP) — Mortgage rates continue to jump, home sales slump and credit cards and auto loans increase. Savings rates are slightly juicier, though.
As the Federal Reserve steadily increases interest rates , many economists say they fear that a recession remains inevitable in the coming months — and with it, job losses that could cause hardship for households already hurt worst by inflation .
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its key short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for a fourth straight time, even as its previous rate increases are being felt by households at all income levels . This would be the sixth rate raise in a row, total.
The Fed’s latest move would raise its benchmark rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%, the highest level in 14 years. Its steady rate increases have already made it increasingly costly for consumers and businesses to borrow — for homes, autos and other purchases. And more hikes are almost surely coming. Fed officials are expected to signal Wednesday that their benchmark rate could reach as high as 4.6% by early next year.

Here’s what to know:
HOW DOES RAISING INTEREST RATES REDUCE INFLATION?
If one definition of inflation is “too much money chasing too few goods,” then by making it more expensive to borrow money, the Fed hopes to reduce the amount of money in circulation, eventually lowering prices.
WHICH CONSUMERS ARE MOST AFFECTED?
Anyone borrowing money to make a large purchase, such as a home, car, or large appliance, will take a hit, according to Scott Hoyt, an analyst with Moody’s Analytics.
“The new rate pretty dramatically increases your monthly payments and your cost,” he said. “It also affects consumers who have a lot of credit card debt — that will hit right away.”
That said, Hoyt noted that household debt payments, as a proportion of income, remain relatively low, though they have risen lately. So even as borrowing rates steadily rise, many households might not feel a much heavier debt burden immediately.
“I’m not sure interest rates are top of mind for most consumers right now,” Hoyt said. “They seem more worried about groceries and what’s going on at the gas pump . Rates can be something tricky for consumers to wrap their minds around.”
ADVERTISEMENT
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT CREDIT CARD RATES?
Even before the Fed’s latest decision, credit card borrowing rates have reached their highest level since 1996, according to Bankrate.com, and these will likely continue to rise.
And with inflation raging, there are signs that Americans are increasingly relying on credit cards to help maintain their spending. Total credit card balances have topped $900 billion, according to the Federal Reserve, a record high, though that amount isn’t adjusted for inflation.
John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult, a survey research firm, said its polling suggests that more Americans are spending down the savings they accumulated during the pandemic and are using credit instead. Eventually, rising rates could make it harder for those households to pay off their debts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Those who don’t qualify for low-rate credit cards because of weak credit scores are already paying significantly higher interest on their balances, and they’ll continue to.
As rates have risen, zero percent loans marketed as “Buy Now, Pay Later” have also become popular with consumers. Yet longer-term loans of more than four payments that these companies offer are subject to the same increased borrowing rates as credit cards.
For people who have home equity lines of credit or other variable-interest debt, rates will increase by roughly the same amount as the Fed hike, usually within one or two billing cycles. That’s because those rates are based in part on banks’ prime rate, which follows the Fed’s.
WHAT IF I WANT TO BUY A CAR?
Since the Federal Reserve began increasing rates in March, the average new vehicle loan has gone up nearly 2 percentage points, from 4.5% to 6.3% in October, according to the Edmunds.com auto site. Used vehicle loans are up 1.5% to 9.6%. For both new and used, loan lengths have gotten slightly longer to just over 70 months on average.
ADVERTISEMENT
Key, though, is the monthly payment, on which most people base their automobile purchases. Edmunds says that since March it’s up $46 to $703 for new vehicles. The payment is up $21 per month for used vehicles to $564.
Edmunds Director of Insights Ivan Drury says the increased payments probably won’t make much of a difference in buying habits, but they’re hitting totals that could stop people from buying. “Now that we’re past $700 per month (on new vehicles) people will drop out of the market,” he said.
HOW ARE SAVERS AFFECTED?
The rising returns on high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have put them at levels not seen since 2009, which means households may want to boost savings wherever possible. You can also now earn more on bonds and other fixed-income investments.
Though savings, CDs, and money market accounts don’t typically track the Fed’s changes, online banks and others that offer high-yield savings accounts can be exceptions. These institutions typically compete aggressively for depositors. (The catch: They sometimes require significantly high deposits.)
ADVERTISEMENT
In general, banks tend to capitalize on a higher-rate environment to boost their profits by imposing higher rates on borrowers, without necessarily offering juicer rates to savers.
WILL THIS AFFECT RENTS? HOME OWNERSHIP?
Last week, the average fixed mortgage rate topped 7% , its highest point in 14 years, meaning that rates on home loans are about twice as expensive as they were a year ago.
Mortgage rates don’t always move perfectly in tandem with the Fed increase, instead tracking the expected yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has reached 4%, its highest level since 2011.
Sales of existing homes have declined for eight straight months as borrowing costs have become too high a hurdle for many Americans already paying more for food, gas and other necessities.
WILL IT BE EASIER TO FIND A HOUSE IF I’M STILL LOOKING TO BUY?
If you’re financially able to proceed with a home purchase, you’re likely to have more options than at any time in the past year.
HOW HAVE THE RATE HIKES INFLUENCED CRYPTO?
Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have dropped in value since the Fed began raising rates. So have many previously high-valued technology stocks. Bitcoin has plunged from a peak of about $68,000 to under $20,000.
Higher rates mean that safe assets like Treasuries have become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased. That makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive, in turn.
Still, bitcoin continues to suffer from problems separate from economic policy. Two major crypto firms have failed, shaking the confidence of crypto investors.
WHAT’S PROMPTING THE RATE INCREASES?
The short answer: Inflation. Over the past year, inflation has clocked in at a painful 8.2%. So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, also rose faster than expected.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned last month that, “our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional” — a remark widely interpreted to mean the Fed will fight inflation with rate increases even if it leads to deep job losses or a recession.
The goal is to slow consumer spending, thereby reducing demand for homes, cars and other goods and services, eventually cooling the economy and lowering prices.
Powell has acknowledged that aggressively raising interest rates would “bring some pain.”
WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?
Some economists argue that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices. One argument is that a tight labor market is fueling wage growth and higher inflation. In August, the economy gained 315,000 jobs. There are roughly two job openings advertised for every unemployed worker.
“Job openings continue to exceed job hires, indicating employers are still struggling to fill vacancies,” said Odeta Kushi, an economist with First American.
WILL THIS AFFECT STUDENT LOANS?
Borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more as as rates increase. The current range for federal loans is between about 5% and 7.5%.
That said, payments on federal student loans are suspended with zero interest until Dec. 31 as part of an emergency measure put in place early in the pandemic. President Joe Biden has also announced some loan forgiveness, of up to $10,000 for most borrowers, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients.
IS THERE A CHANCE THE RATE HIKES WILL BE REVERSED?
Stock prices rose in August based on hopes that the Fed would reverse course. But it looks increasingly unlikely that rates will come down anytime soon. Economists expect Fed officials to signal additional increases in 2023, possibly to nearly 5%.
WILL THERE BE A RECESSION?
Short-term rates at these levels will make a recession likelier by increasing the cost of mortgages, car loans, and business loans. While the Fed hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow growth by cooling the hot job market and capping wage growth, the risk is that the Fed could weaken the economy, causing a recession that would produce significant job losses.

The pick-up in private hiring shown in the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday was concentrated in the services sector, specifically the leisure and hospitality industry. But rapidly rising borrowing costs appeared to weigh on hiring in the goods-producing sector, with factories shedding jobs.
The report followed on the heels of government data on Tuesday showing an unexpected jump in job openings in September.
“A tight labor market and rising wages will complicate things for the Fed and the risk is the labor market could remain tight for quite some time,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. Private employment increased by 239,000 jobs last month. Data for September was revised down to show 192,000 jobs created instead of 208,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 195,000 private jobs.
The services sector added 247,000 jobs, with the leisure and hospitality industry accounting for 210,000 positions. Payrolls in the trade, transportation and utilities industry increased by 84,000 jobs.
But employment decreased in information, financial activities, professional business services as well as education and healthcare industries.
The goods providing sector shed 8,000 jobs as manufacturing lost 20,000 positions. But natural resources and mining added 11,000 jobs while construction payrolls rose by 1,000 positions.
“While we’re seeing early signs of Fed-driven demand destruction, it’s affecting only certain sectors of the labor market,” said Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist.
The report also showed wages for job stayers increased 7.7% in October, in line with recent months. Wage increases for job changers dipped 15.2% from 15.7% in September.
Solid job growth
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for October on Friday. Following recent changes, the jury is still out on whether it offers a reliable signal on the BLS data.
“The figures from recent months have not given us the sense that the ADP report will prove to be a reliable signal about the BLS data in real time,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “Keeping all of that in mind, the October ADP report looks fairly consistent with expectations for Friday’s BLS report, with its headline pointing to October being another strong month for job growth.”
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely rose by 200,000 jobs last month after rising by 288,000 in September. With no job gains expected in the government sector, overall nonfarm payrolls are also forecast to have increased by 200,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September.
Though the Fed’s stiff rate hikes are cooling demand, employers continue to seek workers. There were 10.7 million job openings at the end of September, with roughly 1.9 openings for every unemployed person.",https://nypost.com/2022/11/02/private-sector-added-239000-jobs-in-october-adp/

U.S. Treasury yields were little changed.
The U.S. central bank is expected to announce a fourth three-quarters of a percentage point increase, part of its effort to bring down inflation. The policy statement from the bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in March to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%.
The key question for some market participants is whether the Fed will also signal it could slow additional rate hikes, in a so-called dovish pivot. Analysts said uncertainty over how economic data would pan out meant a dovish pivot could still be some way off.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October. It followed a report on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, also supporting the case for the Fed to remain hawkish. ""The typical calm before the FOMC storm is what we're seeing this morning, across all asset classes really,"" said Michael Brown, head of market intelligence at payments firm Caxton in London. In currencies, the euro was 0.11% higher against the dollar at $0.9885, while against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell 0.8% to 147.03 yen.
A Reuters poll found currency strategists thought the dollar's retreat was temporary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 93.27 points, or 0.29%, to 32,559.93, the S&P 500 lost 17.14 points, or 0.44%, to 3,838.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 71.06 points, or 0.65%, to 10,819.79.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.10% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.21%. Treasury yields were little changed in the hours before the Fed news.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was above 4%, while two-year yields, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was above 4.5%. U.S. crude recently rose 0.44% to $88.76 per barrel and Brent was at $95.03, up 0.4% on the day.
Earlier, upbeat remarks by Chinese regulators about policy support and rising expectations among investors about easing of strict COVID-19 measures boosted sentiment in its market. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday a tweak to the central bank's yield curve control policy, which has contributed to the weakness in the yen, could become a future option.

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Wednesday after data showed private payrolls rose more than expected in October, adding to worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not have enough reason to tone down its aggressive rate hike policy.
With markets already expecting another 75-basis point rate hike later in the day, investors are keenly waiting for any hints from the central bank on smaller increases in December.
However, U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, the ADP National Employment report showed, offering further evidence that the Fed's rapid rate hikes have yet to significantly slow economic growth.
The report showed private payrolls rose by 239,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 195,000 jobs.
It follows a survey on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, which pointed to strong labor demand and doused hopes of a change in the central bank's aggressive policy approach, which helped drive a strong rally for stocks in October.
Still, traders are split on the odds of a 50 bps or 75 bps rate hike in December, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.
The Fed's interest rate decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but focus will be on commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later.
""The Fed has said they're going to be data dependent and that is not good because the inflation numbers are still high and unemployment is low,"" said Fall Ainina, director of research at James Investments.
""The numbers are still not there for the Fed to really pivot.""
The non-farm payrolls report due on Friday will offer further clues on the outlook for interest rates.

S&P 500 futures down 0.3%, Nikkei futures slip
Fed's Powell says nowhere nearing pausing on hikes
Dollar rebounds with Treasury yields
SYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Asian share markets slid on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve laid the groundwork for a protracted tightening campaign that torpedoed market hopes for a pause, sank bonds and lifted the dollar.
Investors were initially cheered that the Fed opened the door to a slowdown in the pace of hikes after raising interest rates 75 basis points to 3.75-4.0%, by noting that policy acted with a lag.
But Chair Jerome Powell soured the mood by saying it was ""very premature"" to think about pausing and that the peak for rates would likely be higher than previously expected.
""The Fed is now more comfortable with taking smaller rate increases for a longer period than delivering larger increases now,"" said Brian Daingerfield, an analyst at NatWest Markets.
""The tightening cycle is officially now a marathon, not a sprint.""
Futures were now split on whether the Fed would move by 50 or 75 basis points in December, and nudged up the top for rates to 5.0-5.25% likely by May next year. They also imply little chance of a rate cut until December 2023.
""Higher for longer"" was not what the equity markets wanted to hear and Wall Street fell sharply after Powell's comments. Early Thursday, S&P 500 futures were off another 0.3%, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.2%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) shed 0.9%, with South Korea (.KS11) down 1.5%.
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) was closed for a holiday, but futures were trading around 350 points below Wednesday's cash close.
Two-year Treasury yields popped up to 4.63% as the curve bear flattened, with the spread to 10-year notes near its most inverted since the turn of the century.
Attention now turns to the U.S. ISM survey of services later Thursday and Friday's payrolls report where any upside surprise will likely reinforce the Fed's hawkish outlook.
BoE TAKES THE STAGE
Also taking centre stage will be the Bank of England where the market is fully priced for a rate hike of 75 basis points to its highest since late 2008 at 3.0%.
""There will be interest in the BoE's new CPI and GDP forecasts, with the latter likely to show a deeper and more protracted recession in 2023 and 2024,"" said Ray Attrill head of FX strategy at NAB.
A gloomy outlook could put more pressure on the pound, which was pinned at $1.1374 after retreating from a top of $1.1564 overnight.
The U.S. dollar was broadly bid on Powell's hawkish take, leaving the dollar index at 112.190 after an overnight bounce from a 110.400 low.
The euro was flat at $0.9810 , having toppled from a high of $0.9976 overnight, while the dollar climbed to 147.87 yen from a trough of 145.68.
The bounce in the dollar and yields was a drag for gold, which was stuck at $1,633 an ounce after being as high as $1,669 at one stage overnight.
Oil prices also disliked the dollar rally with Brent down 88 cents at $95.28 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell $1.02 to $88.98.
In good news for bread lovers, wheat futures plummeted overnight after Russia said it would resume its participation in a deal to export grain from war-torn Ukraine.

11,"U.S. Q3 GDP overshot IMF forecasts, but growth volatile -official",2022-11-02T13:54:53Z,"The International Monetary Fund may need to raise its forecast for U.S. growth after stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP data, a senior IMF official said on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve rate hikes are starting to cool demand, especially in housing.","WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund may need to raise its forecast for U.S. growth after stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP data, a senior IMF official said on Wednesday, but Federal Reserve rate hikes are starting to cool demand, especially in housing.
Nigel Chalk, acting director of the Fund's Western Hemisphere department, told Reuters in an interview that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook forecasts for 1.6% U.S. real GDP growth in 2022 had assumed a lower third-quarter print than the 2.6% annual growth rate reported last week by the Commerce Department.
""It was a strong report. It was definitely a stronger quarter than we had in our forecast in the October WEO so leading from that sense, there's upside,"" Chalk said.
But he said that U.S. GDP has been extremely volatile this year, coming off a 0.6% contraction in the second quarter, with the third-quarter data powered by an unusually large contribution from net exports coupled with a major buildup of inventories.
The IMF in its Oct. 11 World Economic Outlook had cut its U.S. growth forecast by 0.7 percentage point, based on the weak Q2 output earlier in the year. Along with other factors, such as rising food and energy costs prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy, the U.S. reduction offset upside surprises in Europe, leaving the IMF's 2022 global growth forecast unchanged at 3.2%.
But Chalk said the third-quarter data reflected a shift in American consumption patterns that could cause negative spillovers to other countries, namely a shift back to spending on services, including travel, restaurants and healthcare, and away from pandemic-induced demand for imported goods.
""I think this re-composition of demand in the U.S. is a really important feature. Going forward into next year, the U.S. is slowing and that's never good for the global economy,"" Chalk said. ""In addition to slowing, it's shifting away from goods, and that's sort of exacerbating that effect on the global economy.""
U.S. services demand is largely confined within U.S. borders, but demand for imports is falling, he said, adding, ""when U.S. goods demand is declining, that's bad for the rest of the world.""
The IMF has forecast that U.S. growth will decline further to 1.0% in 2023, with global growth falling to 2.7% next year.
But the Fund has also said given the uncertainties over the Ukraine war, energy prices, inflation and China's property sector there was a 25% chance of growth falling below 2% - a phenomenon that has occurred only five times since 1970 - and a more than 10% chance of a global GDP contraction.
Chalk said that the U.S. housing market was already slowing markedly due to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, and the higher rates would likely start to have a bigger effect on U.S. labor markets, wages and inflation in 2023.

12,Stocks open lower on Wall Street ahead of Fed news on rates,2022-11-02T13:45:26Z,NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street ahead of what traders expect will be another big interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are opening modestly lower on Wall Street ahead of what traders expect will be another big interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday that’s expected to produce the sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. The S&P 500 was off 0.4%, as was the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
U.S. futures trading on Wall Street appeared to be in a holding pattern ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase in its attempt to curb inflation.
Futures for the Dow Jones industrials were unchanged and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1%..
The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. It would be the fourth .75 percentage point increase this year.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth while trying not to ignite a recession.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the central bank's fight against inflation would likely come with “some pain."" Powell and his colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs is steadily declining.
In September, America’s employers slowed their hiring but still added 263,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, matching a half-century low. The October jobs report comes this Friday.
In Europe at midday, France's CAC 40 lost 0.2%, Britain's FTSE lost 0.3% and Germany's DAX was essentially flat.
Chinese shares extended gains, driven by speculation Beijing might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade.
“The power of social media and retail investors was evident after stories circled on China’s zero COVID policy and if Beijing is preparing to phase it out,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.
“Despite new lockdowns being announced ... a China reopening is the biggest ticket in town, and it’s better to show up early rather than late to the reopening party,"" he said.
B ullish talk by Chinese regulators who addressed a conference of global financiers in Hong Kong also lifted sentiment.
Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending the meeting to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong. He was among several senior Chinese officials who, speaking in prerecorded video addresses, downplayed risks to the economy due partly to a slump in the real estate sector.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.4% to 15,827.17, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.2% to 3,003.37.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed, declining less than 0.1% to finish at 27,663.39. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.1% to 6,986.70. South Korea’s Kospi added nearly 0.1% to 2,336.87.
South Korea’s export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. Consumer price inflation rose 5.7% on year in October, in line with the market consensus.
“Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after their stellar performance yesterday,” Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said in a report.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 18 cents to $88.55 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 24 cents to $94.89 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 147.05 Japanese yen from 148.23 yen. The euro cost 99 cents, up from 98.78 cents.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9%, while the Russell 2000 rose 0.3%.

The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday that’s expected to produce the sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. The S&P 500 was off 0.4%, as was the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
U.S. futures trading on Wall Street appeared to be in a holding pattern ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase in its attempt to curb inflation.
Futures for the Dow Jones industrials were unchanged and the S&P 500 rose less than 0.1%..
The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point. It would be the fourth .75 percentage point increase this year.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth while trying not to ignite a recession.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the central bank's fight against inflation would likely come with “some pain."" Powell and his colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking committee want to see signs that the abundance of available jobs is steadily declining.
In September, America’s employers slowed their hiring but still added 263,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 3.7% to 3.5%, matching a half-century low. The October jobs report comes this Friday.

Private employment increased by 239,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment report showed on Wednesday. Data for September was revised down to show 192,000 jobs created instead of 208,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 195,000 private jobs.
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics’ more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for October on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely rose by 200,000 jobs last month after rising by 288,000. With no job gains expected in the government sector, overall nonfarm payrolls are also forecast to have increased by 200,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September.
Though the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes are cooling demand, employers continue to seek workers.
The government reported on Tuesday that there were 10.7 million job openings at the end of September, with roughly 1.9 openings for every unemployed person.
The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver a fourth three-quarters of a percentage point interest rate hike on Wednesday as it fights to bring inflation down to its 2 per cent target.

20,Federal Reserve new interest rate hike for November how much,2022-11-02T13:00:33Z,"As it battles inflation that remains at four-decade highs, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike its key interest rate another 0.75% Wednesday.","As it battles inflation that remains at four-decade highs, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike its key interest rate another 0.75% Wednesday.
The Federal Open Market Committee met Tuesday to set the latest rate increase; it is expected to be announced Wednesday afternoon. This interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, affects the cost of borrowing and the pace of investment throughout the economy. Since March, the Fed's rate-hiking has helped make borrowing and investing more expensive, the purpose of which is intended to slow the economy and moderate price increases.
The rate hikes this year have unfolded against the backdrop of a consumer price index that has remained elevated. In September, it clocked in at 8.2% on an annual basis. Food and energy price increases were higher. Even stripped of those two items, whose price swings tend to be more volatile, the index saw its largest increase since 1982.
The rate hike would be the sixth consecutive one this year for the Fed, a cycle not seen since the inflation-fighting days of the early 1980s. The central bank has been bedeviled by stubbornly high inflation readings even as other factors that had been influencing price increases, like higher gas and energy prices, have cooled off.
As a result, some experts believe the Fed must keep raising interest rates, even if it drives unemployment higher. The Fed's dual mandate dictates it must balance inflation and employment. Writing in The Washington Post this week, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to maintain an aggressive stance on rate hikes, even if it causes job losses in the short term.
Summers predicted unemployment would have to rise above 4.4% to get inflation under control. The U.S. unemployment rate currently stands at 3.5%.
""For more than a decade, from 1966 to 1979, policymakers failed to do what was necessary to contain inflation because they shrank from the immediate consequences of restrictive policy,"" Summers wrote. ""History remembers them poorly.""
But debate has been ongoing concerning whether the Fed's posture is now too aggressive, given other signs of weakening in the economy. That includes the fastest deceleration in home price growth on record as mortgage rates soar to more than 7% — the highest in 20 years.
Other interest rates, like those for auto loans and credit cards, are at highs not seen in more than a decade, meaning higher car payments and higher interest fees if you're carrying a balance on your credit card. Another measure of inflation, personal consumption expenditures, has slowed over the past three months, when excluding volatile food and energy prices.
""We doubt Chair Powell’s tone will change significantly this week, but he won’t be able to hold back the tide if the numbers turn,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients Monday.
He said market observers will be keenly focused on Friday's payrolls report, which will show whether average hourly earnings are still growing. Wages have been increasing alongside inflation, though not enough to keep up with the price increases. The average hourly wage in the U.S. is now $32.46 as of September, up from $28.09 in September 2019. While workers may be enjoying higher salaries, the extra money gets eaten up by higher prices paid for goods and services.
""The Fed will not pause — never mind consider easing — as long as wage growth remains much faster than is consistent with the inflation target,"" Shepherdson wrote.
Other economic experts say inflation is steering the ship.
""Despite a rapidly cooling housing market, inflation has shown no signs of letting up, the labor market is still strong, and the economy is resilient,"" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with Bankrate, said in a statement. ""This forces the Fed to continue its aggressive approach on interest rates.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/interest-rate-hike-november-2022-how-much-federal-reserve-rcna54863
21,Federal Reserve meeting: Fed poised to hike rates,2022-11-02T12:52:00Z,Powell is likely to be asked whether the Fed will slow rate hikes designed to fight inflation in the coming months.,"With another three-quarter-point hike expected for the Fed's key short-term rate, watchers are looking for hints on the future.
WASHINGTON — Looming over the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday is a question of intense interest: Just how high will the Fed's inflation-fighters raise interest rates — and might they slow their rate hikes as soon as next month?
The Fed on Wednesday is expected to announce a hefty three-quarter-point hike in its key short-term rate — its fourth straight — which will lead to still-higher loan rates for many businesses and consumers. What many Fed-watchers hope is that Chair Jerome Powell will hint at a news conference that the central bank may ease the pace of its hikes, perhaps to a half-point in December and two quarter-point hikes next year.
Even at that more moderate pace, the central bank's benchmark rate would reach 4.75% to 5%, which would be its highest range since 2007, up from the current 3% to 3.25%. Fed officials have stressed that they need to sharply raise rates to tame inflation, which reached 8.2% in September from 12 months earlier, barely below a 40-year high. Chronic inflation has also become a central point of attack for Republicans against Democrats in the midterm congressional elections.
So far this year, the Fed has raised its key rate five times in an aggressive pace that has sent borrowing rates surging across the economy and heightened the risk of a recession. The home market, in particular, has been badly bruised as a consequence. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, surpassed 7% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months.
One reason the Fed's policymakers might feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.
Still, the job market remains consistently strong, which could make it harder for the Fed to cool the economy and curb inflation. On Tuesday, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply.
A ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers. Those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices, thereby fueling more inflation.
If Powell does signal Wednesday that the Fed may lift its foot slightly off the economic brakes, it could spark a rally in stock and bond prices. Such higher asset prices, though, might then fuel more spending just when the Fed wants to cool things down to throttle inflation.
To offset any potential burst of optimism, the Fed may signal at its next meeting in December that it expects to add at least another rate hike early next year. That would serve to make borrowing even more expensive and would further heighten the risk of a recession.
Ultimately, economists at Goldman Sachs expect the Fed's policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5% by March. That is above what the Fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in September.
For now, many Fed officials have said they see few signs that inflation is easing in any sustainable way. They point, in particular, to so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures.",https://www.wltx.com/article/news/nation-world/fed-rate-hike-november-powell/507-ee350f2a-0928-40c9-89d3-9242cec660b9

23,The two words investors want to hear from Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting,2022-11-02T12:25:03Z,"Investors will be looking to see whether the central bank plans to take a ""step down"" from its monetary policy path.","As markets look for signs that the Federal Reserve is stepping away from its breakneck pace of interest rate hikes, two words from this week's meeting could be crucial. Investors will be looking to see whether the central bank plans to take a ""step down"" from its monetary policy path, an expression used recently by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and adopted multiple times in Wall Street market and economic commentary. No one is expecting the Fed to stop rate hikes, at least for several months. But news that this week could be the end of a string of three-quarter point increases at least would provide some balm for weary financial markets. Investors have been hoping for a Fed ""pivot"" on policy, but likely will take anything they can get at this point, even if it just means a nod to a potential half-point hike in December. ""While it is hard to call hikes of 75 [basis points] and 50 [basis points] a 'pivot,' we think some may try to claim victory, but even here there is difficulty,"" Walls Fargo economists wrote in a recent client note. ""For this to occur, the Fed would need to signal a near-term 'step-down.'"" A basis point is one one-hundredth of one percentage point. Thus far this year, the Fed has r aised its benchmark short-term borrowing rate 3 percentage points, or 300 basis points. Uncertainty ahead Markets have almost completely priced in the 75 basis point move for November, but are split on December between 50 and 75, according to CME Group data. The expectation from there is for a pronounced slowdown, so Wall Street will be watching carefully Wednesday for language in the post-Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement, as well as Chairman Jerome Powell 's news conference thereafter. ""We expect the FOMC to deliver a fourth 75bp rate hike at its November meeting, and indicate that it could soon be appropriate to step down the pace of hikes,"" Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner wrote. ""We continue to expect the Fed to step down to 50bp in December and 25bp in January, reaching a peak rate of 4.625%."" What the ""step down"" language will mean, however, is unclear. Federal Reserve officials are watching the economic data closely, and some of it is not cooperating with the central bank's quest to return inflation to 2%. Consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures releases show inflation still near 40-year highs. The labor market remains extraordinarily tight, evidenced by a release Wednesday showing job openings still outnumber available labor by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Some economists think the Fed will be leery about tipping its hand for future rate moves. If the data continue to show a vibrant labor market and high prices, officials will want the option of continuing down the present path. Even Daly, the San Francisco regional president who talked extensively about the ""step-down"" concept, said she hasn't changed her views about where rates need to go over the long run, only that she'd like to see the intensity of the increases lessened. ""For me, it's really challenging to step down right now when we have inflation printing so high and we have core services inflation rising and we also have the unemployment rate at historical lows,"" Daly said in a public appearance a few weeks ago. ""I make the distinction between when you start talking about it vs. when you start doing it. I think the time is now to start talking about stepping down."" Wall Street expects those to be baby steps down. ""We expect the Fed to remain data dependent and emphasize cumulative policy rate tightening over any step down in pace,"" Bank of America said in a client note. ""The November FOMC meeting is not about the November policy rate decision. Instead, the meeting is about future policy rate guidance and what to expect in December and beyond."" The bank's experts said it expects Powell to be cautious. Possible letdown Markets already have misinterpreted the chair's comments in the past — over the summer, a seemingly innocuous comment from Powell that he expects a day to come when the pace of hikes would diminish set off a feverish rally on Wall Street that was the exact opposite of what the Fed wants as it looks to tighten financial conditions. ""We think the Fed will be reluctant to pre-commit to a smaller rate hike this far in advance. Data still need to cooperate,"" BofA said. ""Committee members may also be reluctant to signal a slower pace of hikes lest financial markets interpret the decision as a 'dovish pivot.'"" On balance, the bank said, investors may be somewhat disappointed as Powell remains noncommittal as ""appropriate policy is now ultimately about the final destination and not the journey."" Even with the step-down hopes from Wednesday's meeting, market expectations are still for a fairly aggressive Fed. Futures pricing points to a ""terminal rate,"" or the point where the Fed stops, at just shy of 5%, or 2 percentage points above the current funds rate level. Fed officials have been steadfast that they plan on holding rates higher, even if it means higher unemployment and a slow-growth economy. ""I'm not sure how much the Fed is going to tip their hand to show how much they're going to do in December,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.

24,U.S. private payrolls beat expectations in October - ADP,2022-11-02T12:03:28Z,"U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, offering more evidence of labor market resilience and suggesting that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while.","WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, offering more evidence of labor market resilience and suggesting that the Federal Reserve could continue to aggressively raise interest rates for a while.
Private employment increased by 239,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment report showed on Wednesday. Data for September was revised down to show 192,000 jobs created instead of 208,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 195,000 private jobs.
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics' more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for October on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely rose by 200,000 jobs last month after rising by 288,000. With no job gains expected in the government sector, overall nonfarm payrolls are also forecast to have increased by 200,000. The economy created 263,000 jobs in September.
Though the Fed's aggressive rate hikes are cooling demand, employers continue to seek workers.
The government reported on Tuesday that there were 10.7 million job openings at the end of September, with roughly 1.9 openings for every unemployed person.
The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver a fourth three-quarters of a percentage point interest rate hike on Wednesday as it fights to bring inflation down to its 2% target. The Fed has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero in March to the current range of 3.00% to 3.25%, the swiftest pace of policy tightening in a generation or more.

25,Mortgage rates fall for first time in months,2022-11-02T11:06:43Z,"Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.","FILE – This is a home in Mount Lebanon, Pa., under contract, Oct. 17, 2022.

(The Hill) — Mortgage rates dipped slightly last week for the first time in more than two months amid the Federal Reserve’s ongoing fight with inflation, according to data released Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).
MBA’s weekly survey shows the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate falling to 7.06 percent, down from 7.16 a week earlier, and applications decreasing for the sixth-straight week. Rates, however, remained near the highest level in two decades.
The share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM’s), which rose recently as mortgage rates surged, declined from the previous week to 11.8 percent of total applications.
Despite the small drop in the 30-year fixed rate, mortgage rates are significantly higher than last year and continue to challenge buyers and the housing market overall.
“Apart from the ARM loan rate, rates for all other loan types were more than three percentage points higher than they were a year ago,” Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist, said in a statement.
“These elevated rates continue to put pressure on both purchase and refinance activity and have added to the ongoing affordability challenges impacting the broader housing market, as seen in the deteriorating trends in housing starts and home sales,” Kan added.
Meanwhile, the share of refinance activity stayed low as homeowners are hesitant to risk losing their low rates.
“With most homeowners locked into significantly lower rates, refinance applications continued to run more than 80 percent below last year’s pace, while the refinance share of applications was 28.6 percent – the fifth straight week below 30 percent,” Kan said.
The drop in mortgage rates follows months of steady increases fueled by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest hikes to curb rising inflation. And experts expect the Fed to increase rates again during the U.S. central bank’s meeting on Wednesday.
Overall, the Fed’s fight with inflation has led to a dramatic cooling of the once red-hot housing market.
Surging rates in recent weeks have led to record home price deceleration and plummeting pending sales. The number of homes under contract fell for the fourth consecutive month in September, declining by 10.2 percent from August, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
And NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun expects high rates to linger.
“The new normal for mortgage rates could be around 7% for a while,” Yun said in a statement last week.
“On a $300,000 loan, that translates to a typical monthly mortgage payment of nearly $2,000, compared to $1,265 just one year ago – a difference of more than $700 per month. Only when inflation is tamed will mortgage rates retreat and boost home purchasing power for buyers,” Yun said.",https://www.wcia.com/news/national/mortgage-rates-fall-for-first-time-in-months/

Brent crude dipped 56 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $94.09 a barrel by 1027 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 53 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $87.84 per barrel.
U.S. crude oil stocks fell about 6.5 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 28, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures.
At the same time, gasoline inventories fell 2.6 million barrels, more than expected. Official data is due at 1430 GMT.
China’s zero-COVID policy has been a key factor in keeping a lid on oil prices as repeated lockdowns have slowed growth and pared oil demand in the world’s second-largest economy.
An unverified note on social media said the Chinese government was going to consider ways to relax COVID-19 rules from next March, potentially boosting demand in the world’s No.2 oil user.
Meanwhile, the dollar fell from Tuesday’s highs as investors braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision at 1800 GMT, with many hoping for signs of a slowdown in future rate hikes.
A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The potential disruption from the European Union embargo on Russian oil that is set to start on Dec. 5 may also be pushing prices higher. The ban, a reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will be followed by a halt on oil product imports in February.
“Despite slowing economies and China’s COVID-19 woes, the odds are that the lack of supply will gain the upper hand over demand concerns in the short term. Therefore, expect oil prices to close out this year heading into triple-digit territory,” PVM analyst Stephen Brennock said.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/article-oil-prices-slip-ahead-of-expected-us-federal-reserve-rate-hike/
27,"Fed set to raise rates by 75 basis points once again, Powell to talk hike path",2022-11-02T10:18:45Z,The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday again by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting as the central bank continues to try to tame multi-decade highs in inflation.,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday again by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight meeting as the central bank continues to try to tame multi-decade highs in inflation.
Four 75-basis-point rate hikes in a row is unprecedented since the Fed explicitly started targeting the federal funds rate to conduct monetary policy in the late 1980s.
That level of rate hike would bring the central bank’s policy rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.75% to 4% — its highest level since the end of 2007— from a current range between 3% and 3.25%.
Recent comments from Fed officials point to the propensity to slow down the pace of rate hikes if inflation data shows a clear downward trend. Investors will be focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell says in his press conference about how quickly and how high rates could go in the coming months.
""We might find ourselves, and the markets have certainly priced this in, with another 75-basis-point increase,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said at a meeting of the University of California, Berkeley's Fisher Center for Real Estate & Urban Economics' Policy Advisory Board last week. ""But I would really recommend people don't take that away and think, well it's 75 forever.""
The Fed will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET followed by Fed Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. This post will be updated.
Recent data appear to point to signs that domestic demand is being pushed down by higher interest rates. Final sales to private domestic purchasers — a measure of consumer and business spending used to assess underlying demand in the economy — inched up at a 0.1% annual rate in the third quarter after rising 0.5% in the second quarter and 2.1% in the first quarter.
The job market is also cooling, with job openings falling sharply in August and the job quits rate trending lower while fewer new jobs being minted on a monthly basis. Economists project that Friday's job report will show that 200,000 nonfarm payrolls were created in October, a result that would be down from the 263,000 jobs created in September and down from the monthly average of 420,000 in 2022.
Story continues
There are also signs below the surface that inflationary pressures are easing. The employment cost index showed private wages and salaries rising by 1.2% in the third quarter, down from 1.6% in the second, pushing the annual growth rate down from 5.7% to 5.2%.

Other measures of inflation aren’t easing as quickly as officials hope. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — the price consumption expenditures index (PCE) excluding volatile food and energy prices — rose by 5.1% in September and 6.2% on a headline basis. That’s down from 7% but still far from the Fed’s 2% inflation target. And the consumer price index — excluding volatile food and energy prices a stickier measure of inflation — rose by 6.6% in September, accelerating from 6.3% in August and 5.9% in July.
“The November FOMC meeting is not about the November policy rate decision,” Bank of America analyst, Michael Gapen, wrote in a research note to clients. “Instead, the meeting is about future policy rate guidance and what to expect in December and beyond.”

28,What to watch for in the Federal Reserve policy announcement,2022-11-02T10:08:55Z,"The Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again on Wednesday, approving a fourth-straight rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point as part of an aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the US economy.","Washington, D.C. CNN —
The Federal Reserve is expected to make history yet again on Wednesday, approving a fourth-straight rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point as part of an aggressive battle to bring down the white-hot inflation that is plaguing the US economy.
The supersized hike would bring the central bank’s benchmark lending rate to a new target range of 3.75% to 4%. That’s the highest the fed funds rate has been since January 2008.
Wednesday’s decision, which comes at the end of a two-day policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, would also mark the Fed’s toughest policy move since the 1980s and will likely deepen the economic pain for millions of American businesses and households by pushing up the cost of borrowing even further. There’s also a chance it could trigger a recession.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell has stressed that persistent, entrenched inflation would bring greater economic suffering than a recession would, he has also acknowledged the economic hardships that result from tightening monetary policy.
“I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn’t,” he said in September.
Here’s what to watch for: According to the CME Fedwatch tool, traders believe there’s nearly a 90% chance of a three-quarter-percentage-point rate hike this month. That means investors have already switched their focus to the December meeting, which they expect will be the point at which the central bank starts to dial back its hawkish policy stance.
They will be closely watching Powell’s post-meeting press conference to see if he lays the groundwork for a step down in the pace of rate hikes. “He could do so by acknowledging the slowdown in the real economy already underway and emphasizing the lags between slowing economic activity and weakening price pressures,” wrote Michael Pearce, senior economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Recent data only underscores the “choose your own adventure” aspect of the US economy: Mortgage rates at levels not seen in almost 20 years are beginning to choke the housing market. Sales of newly constructed homes dropped 10.9% in September from August and were down 17.6% from a year ago.
Yet some inflationary pressures are easing. Wages and salaries rose by 1.2% in the third quarter, down from 1.6% in the second, according to the Employment Cost Index.
And through it all, the job market has remained tight. Job openings unexpectedly surged in September, indicating there are 1.9 job openings for every available worker. Friday’s upcoming jobs report is expected to show the economy added another 205,000 positions in October, down from last month but still historically high.
Looking forward: Wednesday’s policy announcement and the press conference that immediately follows will be closely analyzed for any potential forward guidance by the Fed.
“A 75 basis-point hike from the Fed this week is practically a done deal. The much bigger question is around how the Fed signals its future policy path,” wrote Luke Bartholomew, senior economist at abrdn, in a note.
“The challenge for the Fed is to signal a slowdown without letting the market develop a narrative of the Fed ‘pivoting’ away from its current priority of cooling underlying inflation pressures,” he wrote.",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/02/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-inflation/index.html

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise its key short-term interest rate by 0.75% for a fourth straight time after its two-day meeting concludes at 2:00 p.m. ET.

Treasury yields advanced along with equities. The benchmark 10-year note held above 4%, while the rate-sensitive two-year yields overed around 4.5%.
Investors will assess remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the aftermath of the rate decision, along with economic projections from policymakers and the latest dot plot showing each member’s forecast for the U.S. short-term interest rate.
""The focus will be on what comes next, and we expect Chair Powell to hint that the Federal Open Market Committee will likely slow the pace to 50 basis points in December,"" economists at Goldman Sachs led by Jan Hatzius said in a recent note.
Any signal from the central bank on a potential easing in the pace of tightening will serve as a tailwind for the major indexes, which closed last month higher on expectations of a policy pivot stoked by chatter from some officials suggesting a scale back rate increases and global concerns that tightening may trigger financial instability. But some strategists have pushed back against the notion that a shift in the Fed’s path is imminent, with inflation and payrolls still elevated.
“As of now, the inflation and labor market criteria have not been met, so Mr. Powell can’t pre-announce any intention to shift to slower rate increases without contradicting what he said just six weeks ago,” Pantheon Economics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said in emailed comments. “Evidence of fading pressure in the pipeline is abundant, but it is yet to hit the numbers which the Fed Chair has said clearly on multiple occasions matter most, namely, the actual core inflation data.”

Summary Companies Fed to release policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT)

Fed chief Powell to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the fourth straight time on Wednesday, but open the door to a future slowdown in its policy tightening as it balances the risk of stubbornly high inflation against the economic strains of tighter credit.
The U.S. central bank will announce its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to elaborate on policymakers' thinking in a news conference half an hour later.
The Fed will not release new quarterly economic projections, leaving Powell to finesse what may be a particularly tricky update about the Federal Open Market Committee's expectations for the economy, inflation and interest rates.
Rising prices are a top-of-mind concern cited in public opinion polls and among investors, and have been a centerpiece of Republican criticism of the Biden administration ahead of next week's congressional elections.
Data since the Fed's Sept. 20-21 policy meeting has given little sense that inflation, which has been running at 40-year highs, is easing in a decisive way. The job market remains strong.
Yet some Fed policymakers have begun to worry more openly that lifting borrowing costs too aggressively could drive the economy into a needless recession, noting that some survey and private data show price pressures beginning to ease.
If Powell does set the stage for smaller rate hikes in the future, it will be with language that tries to avoid any commitment and leans heavily on how the economy and inflation behave in coming weeks.
The release on Tuesday of a report showing an unexpected jump in job openings in September ""is another example of data 'not cooperating' with the Fed's desire to slow the pace of rate hikes,"" Citi analysts wrote. ""Resilient data raises further the risk that any slowdown is paired with hawkish communication that policy rates could rise for longer and to higher terminal rates.""
LITTLE CLARITY
The rate hike the Fed is expected to deliver on Wednesday will move the target federal funds rate 75 basis points higher to a level between 3.75% and 4.00%. The policy rate has not been that high since early 2008, and the pace of the Fed's moves this year - 375 basis points of tightening after the expected move on Wednesday - is unmatched since the far stiffer rate increases former Fed Chair Paul Volcker resorted to in the 1980s.
Reuters Graphics
Ahead of the release of Wednesday's policy statement, traders in contracts tied to the federal funds rate were split on whether the Fed would be able to slow the pace of upcoming hikes, or would approve yet another ""unusually large"" three-quarters-of-a-percentage-point increase at the December meeting.
Data since the September meeting has given the central bank little clarity. Separate reports showed consumer prices rising 8.2% in the 12 months through September, and a different index preferred by the Fed still more than triple the central bank's 2% target.
Yet some surveys and private data have showed price pressures at least on the cusp of easing, a fact that Fed officials may rely on to set the stage for more modest rate hikes to come.
Outside critics, including some members of Congress with oversight of the Fed, have also cautioned against pushing rate hikes too far - with the sharp rise in rates on 30-year fixed mortgages cited as a prime example of central bank policy hitting consumers in a meaningful way.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell in late morning trading on Wall Street Wednesday, ahead of what traders expect will be another big interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
Markets will be watching closely to see what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the central bank’s outlook for how long rates will need to stay high to fight inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.5% as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 46 points, or 0.1%, to 32,608 and the Nasdaq fell 1%. Small company stocks lost more ground than the broader market. The Russell 2000 fell 1.3%.
The Fed is due to wrap up a two-day policy meeting later Wednesday that’s expected to produce the sixth interest rate increase of the year. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point.
Investors will be listening closely to Powell’s comments as they try to determine what the central bank’s next move will be at its final meeting of the year in December. Opinions are currently split among investors as to whether the Fed will make another three-quarters point move or dial back to a half-point increase.

The path ahead for the Fed is closely tied to whether inflation cools from its hottest levels in four decades. Wall Street is concerned about inflation squeezing consumers and businesses while worries grow that the Fed could bring on a recession by slowing the economy too much.
“At the end of the day, the markets like certainty and they don’t have certainty from the Fed,” said Ryan Grabinski, managing director of investment strategy at Strategas, a Baird company.
Powell has warned that the central bank’s fight against inflation would likely come with “some pain.”
Wall Street has been closely watching the latest economic data, which is heavy on the employment market this week. It has remained strong despite inflation, which is being taken as a sign that the Fed will have to remain aggressive in its fight against high prices.
The latest jobs data from private payroll company ADP shows that companies added positions at a greater pace than expected in October. The report follows hotter-than-expected data from the government Tuesday on job openings .

“It’s sort of confirming that the Fed still has more work to do,” Grabinski said.
Investors will get more employment data with the government’s weekly unemployment report on Thursday and a broader monthly jobs report on Friday. They have been closely watching the latest round of company earnings to get a better sense of inflation’s impact on corporate profits and outlooks. It’s been a mixed bag so far.

TOKYO – Asian shares were mixed Wednesday while Chinese benchmarks surged ahead of a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on an interest rate increase to curb inflation.
Oil prices rose more than $1 a barrel and U.S. futures were also higher. Stocks ended lower on Wall Street after an unexpectedly strong report on the job market raised concerns the Fed will keep the pressure on inflation with big rate increases.
Chinese shares extended gains after strong advances a day earlier driven by speculation the government might be preparing to gradually relax stringent COVID-19 restrictions. Since that was not followed by any official confirmation, the enthusiasm could quickly fade.
“The power of social media and retail investors was evident after stories circled on China’s zero COVID policy and if Beijing is preparing to phase it out,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.
“Despite new lockdowns being announced ... a China reopening is the biggest ticket in town, and it’s better to show up early rather than late to the reopening party,"" he said.
B ullish talk by Chinese regulators who addressed a conference of global financiers in Hong Kong also lifted sentiment.
Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, urged those attending the meeting to visit China to understand what is happening in the country and urged them not to “bet against” China and Hong Kong. He was among several senior Chinese officials who, speaking in prerecorded video addresses, downplayed risks to the economy due partly to a slump in the real estate sector.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.6% to 15,859.39, while the Shanghai Composite index added 1.7% to 3,018.78.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 declined 0.1% to 27,643.18. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.1% to 6,986.70. South Korea’s Kospi slipped nearly 0.1% to 2,333.67.
South Korea’s export growth fell in October as demand from China fell. Consumer price inflation rose 5.7% on year in October, in line with the market consensus.
“Sentiments in the Asia session could largely hold on to some wait-and-see as well, but eyes will remain on Chinese equities after their stellar performance yesterday,” Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG in Singapore, said in a report.
The Fed was due to begin a two-day policy meeting Wednesday that’s expected to yield its sixth interest rate increase of the year as the central bank fights the worst inflation in four decades. The widespread expectation is for the Fed to push through another increase that’s triple the usual size, or three-quarters of a percentage point.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 3,856.10 after having been up as much as 1% shortly after trading opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to 32,653.20 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.9%, to 10,890.85. The Russell 2000 rose 0.3% to 1,851.39.
Big technology stocks were the biggest weights on the market. Their big valuations give them more heft in pushing the broader market up or down. Also, rising interest rates tend to make the sector look less attractive because of those high valuations. Apple fell 1.8%.
Communication services stocks, retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending also helped drag down the overall S&P 500, keeping gains in banks, energy firms and other sectors of the market in check.
The Labor Department reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in September, suggesting the labor market is not cooling as fast as the Fed hoped for as it tries to slow economic growth.
Earnings remain a big focus for investors this week. Starbucks and Warner Bros. Discovery report earnings on Thursday and Cardinal Health does so on Friday.
Outside of earnings, Abiomed surged 49.9% after health care giant Johnson & Johnson said it will pay $16.6 billion for the heart pump maker. Johnson & Johnson slipped 0.5%.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added $1.32 to $89.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $1.19 to $95.84 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 147.35 Japanese yen from 148.23 yen. The euro cost 98.95 cents, up from 98.78 cents.

41,Powell likely to be pressed on whether Fed will slow hikes,2022-11-02T05:52:00Z,WASHINGTON (AP) — Looming over the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday is a...,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Looming over the Federal Reserve meeting that ends Wednesday is a question of intense interest: Just how high will the Fed's inflation-fighters raise interest rates — and might they slow their rate hikes as soon as next month?
The Fed on Wednesday is expected to announce a hefty three-quarter-point hike in its key short-term rate — its fourth straight — which will lead to still-higher loan rates for many businesses and consumers. What many Fed-watchers hope is that Chair Jerome Powell will hint at a news conference that the central bank may ease the pace of its hikes, perhaps to a half-point in December and two quarter-point hikes next year.
Even at that more moderate pace, the central bank's benchmark rate would reach 4.75% to 5%, which would be its highest range since 2007, up from the current 3% to 3.25%. Fed officials have stressed that they need to sharply raise rates to tame inflation, which reached 8.2% in September from 12 months earlier, barely below a 40-year high. Chronic inflation has also become a central point of attack for Republicans against Democrats in the midterm congressional elections.
So far this year, the Fed has raised its key rate five times in an aggressive pace that has sent borrowing rates surging across the economy and heightened the risk of a recession. The home market, in particular, has been badly bruised as a consequence. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, surpassed 7% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months.
One reason the Fed's policymakers might feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.
Still, the job market remains consistently strong, which could make it harder for the Fed to cool the economy and curb inflation. On Tuesday, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply.
A ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers. Those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices, thereby fueling more inflation.
If Powell does signal Wednesday that the Fed may lift its foot slightly off the economic brakes, it could spark a rally in stock and bond prices. Such higher asset prices, though, might then fuel more spending just when the Fed wants to cool things down to throttle inflation.
To offset any potential burst of optimism, the Fed may signal at its next meeting in December that it expects to add at least another rate hike early next year. That would serve to make borrowing even more expensive and would further heighten the risk of a recession.
Ultimately, economists at Goldman Sachs expect the Fed's policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5% by March. That is above what the Fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in September.
For now, many Fed officials have said they see few signs that inflation is easing in any sustainable way. They point, in particular, to so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures.
“We need to see actual progress in core inflation and services inflation,"" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said recently. “And we are not seeing it yet.”",https://www.bigrapidsnews.com/news/article/Powell-likely-to-be-pressed-on-whether-Fed-will-17551383.php

European markets looked set to extend the cautious optimism, with the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.5%. U.S. S&P 500 futures edged up 0.3% while the Nasdaq futures rose 0.4%. The world's biggest central bank is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, with investors set to closely scrutinise the statement and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell for any signal that policymakers are contemplating tempering rate hikes.
Markets widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) to a range of 3.75% to 4.00%, the fourth such increase in a row. However, traders are split on the size of the hike in December, with futures market pricing in a 44.5% probability of a 50-bps increase, according to CME's Fed tool.
""We suspect Chair Powell will try very hard to avoid saying anything that might be misconstrued as a signal that the inevitable step down in the size of tightening is a pivot toward the end of the tightening cycle,"" said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. ""Given that the inflation-related data have yet to show any signs of any moderation, we lean a bit more toward officials holding off from signalling they are reducing the size of hikes just yet.""
Cummins expects the Fed to step down to a 50 bps hike in December. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.8% after wobbling earlier in the day, with Chinese bluechips and Hong Kong stocks reversing losses on hopes that China will ease its tough zero-COVID restrictions.
An unverified note circulating on social media on Tuesday that China was planning a reopening from strict COVID curbs in March triggered a sharp rebound following last month's savage selling. But quarantines and business disruptions in China are surging again and some analysts expect no major policy shifts until well into next year or even 2024. Hong Kong is holding an investment summit on Wednesday to rebuild the COVID-ravaged city's image as the region's financial hub, with Chief Executive John Lee pledging it would continue working towards lifting COVID curbs.
Chinese policymakers also reaffirmed their support for Hong Kong and welcomed foreign investors to the city. Hang Seng index surged 2.5%, after a whopping 5.2% in the previous session. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.1%.
Overnight, a survey showed U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in September, suggesting that demand for labour remains strong despite rate hikes. That sparked a reversal in Treasury yields and lifted market bets on interest rates to above 5% next year. U.S. stocks closed lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipping 0.24%, the S&P 500 shedding 0.41%and the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.89%.
In the currencies market, the dollar eased 0.2% against a basket of major currencies. It fell 0.5% against the Japanese yen to 147.6 yen amid fears of intervention from authorities and thin liquidity. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday a tweak to the central bank's yield curve control policy, which has contributed to the weakness in the yen, could become a future option.
The safe-haven greenback gave up some of the rapid gains this year in October on speculation the Fed might indicate a slowdown in its aggressive tightening campaign. The dollar's retreat in foreign exchange markets is temporary, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists, who said the greenback still had enough strength left to reclaim or surpass its recent highs and resume its relentless rise.
""In the Fed's view, putting the U.S. into a recession is still a lesser evil than not tackling entrenched price pressures,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. ""My own view is the risks are skewed for a hawkish reaction – USD higher, but I will recognise the moves in rates suggests the market is largely positioned for this outcome.""
U.S. Treasury yields were largely steady on Wednesday after reversing much of the losses overnight on the unexpected strength in the jobs data. The yield on benchmark ten-year notes was little changed at 4.0422% while the yield on two-year notes eased 4 basis points to 4.5157%.
In commodities, oil climbed after industry data showed a surprise drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, suggesting demand is holding up. U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.4% to $89.65 per barrel, while Brent crude futures was up 1.2% at $95.82.
Gold was slightly higher, with spot price trading at $1649.72 per ounce.

Goodwin said in a note that she expected the Fed to hike by 0.75 of a percentage point on Wednesday and half a point in December, but that the slowdown should not be seen as the start of a big shift from the central bank.
""A Fed pause is not the same as a pivot. Certainly, deteriorating economic and credit conditions could cause the Fed to pivot modestly at some point, but a full pivot into accommodative territory is highly unlikely in the next year,"" Goodwin said in a note.
Goodwin pointed out that the first rate hikes should now start to show their impact across the broad economy, instead of just housing. However, the Fed will need several months of data to go its way before changing course.
""At this point, with inflation surprising as much as it has already, the Fed will want to see clear signs of reversal in wage growth before pivoting. Recession should be considered a base case rather than a risk,"" Goodwin said.

So far this year, the Fed has raised its key rate five times in an aggressive pace that has sent borrowing rates surging across the economy and heightened the risk of a recession. The home market, in particular, has been badly bruised as a consequence. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, surpassed 7% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months.
One reason the Fed’s policymakers might feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes is that some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.
Still, the job market remains consistently strong, which could make it harder for the Fed to cool the economy and curb inflation. On Tuesday, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply.

A ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers. Those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices, thereby fueling more inflation.
If Powell does signal Wednesday that the Fed may lift its foot slightly off the economic brakes, it could spark a rally in stock and bond prices. Such higher asset prices, though, might then fuel more spending just when the Fed wants to cool things down to throttle inflation.
To offset any potential burst of optimism, the Fed may signal at its next meeting in December that it expects to add at least another rate hike early next year. That would serve to make borrowing even more expensive and would further heighten the risk of a recession.

Ultimately, economists at Goldman Sachs expect the Fed’s policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5% by March. That is above what the Fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in September.
For now, many Fed officials have said they see few signs that inflation is easing in any sustainable way. They point, in particular, to so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is considered a good reflection of underlying price pressures.
“We need to see actual progress in core inflation and services inflation,” Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said recently. “And we are not seeing it yet.”",https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-jerome-powell-government-and-politics-875599570f2b3bfc132963010a404f09

The Federal Reserve has yet again hiked interest rates — and now the US economy needs to wait and see how much longer the increases will keep coming.
On Wednesday, the central bank decided during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that it would raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, the fourth consecutive time the Fed has raised rates at this scale. These aggressive hikes are part of the Fed's strategy to lower inflation levels by slowing down the economy, and despite concerns that acting too aggressively could prompt a recession, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stood by the strategy during Wednesday remarks.
""Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run,"" Powell said. ""The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.""
But, as he said, it might soon be time to slow the rate of those increases.
""It will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal,"" Powell said. ""So that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that, no decision has been made,"" he added.
Despite suggesting moving back to smaller hikes as soon as next month, Powell also noted that the Fed would continue raising rates until inflation is tamed. ""Incoming data since our last meeting suggests that ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected,"" he also said.
These hikes have already made borrowing more expensive for Americans — 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen to 7%, credit card rates will soon rise from the current 19%, and auto loans will likely get more expensive.
Some lawmakers and economists have warned that continuing to raise rates could lead to a recession and job losses. Meanwhile, the Fed is aiming to achieve a ""soft landing,"" in which it can keep increasing interest rates just enough to combat inflation, but not enough to cause a recession. While Powell said achieving a soft landing may still be possible, it's now more difficult.
""We've always said it was going to be difficult,"" he said, adding that ""to the extent rates have to go higher for longer and stay higher for longer, that path has narrowed.""
Despite concerns of a recession, the White House stood by the central bank's method to tackle rising prices across the country. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a Wednesday briefing that ""the Fed actions help bring inflation down.""
""This is part of our transition to stable and steady growth,"" she added.
But along with concerns that the Fed is acting too aggressively from lawmakers like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement that the Fed's Wednesday hike ""will have a direct and harmful impact on working people and our families.""
""A recession would instead cause companies to hire fewer people, making it harder for young workers, workers of color and others who have greater barriers finding jobs, and put downward pressure on the wages of all working people who will bear the brunt of an overactive monetary policy,"" she said. ""Increasing interest rates signals to working people that the government thinks we have too much money and we should have less money to spend.""
Powell stood by the hikes, but said they might soon come at a lesser scale to hopefully avoid a recession.
""I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast,"" he said. ""I think it's been good and a successful program we that we've gotten this far this fast. Remember though, that we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases and we have some ground left to cover here, and cover it we will.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/when-will-fed-stop-raising-interest-rates-hikes-slow-december-2022-11
48,How the Fed Rate Hike Can Move Markets and What a Fed Pivot Means,2022-11-02T04:00:00Z,"With the Federal Reserve making its rate hike announcement today, Wall Street experts have been wondering when to expect a central bank pivot.","Good morning, team. Phil Rosen here, writing to you not far from the Federal Reserve building in New York.
With inflation still soaring above the Fed's 2% target, central bankers today are expected to stay vigilant in their inflation battle in making a fourth consecutive 75 basis-point move.
That would bring the benchmark rate into the 3.75%-4% range.
But that's not what's notable. Traders have largely priced in a move of that size.

1. Wall Street's top strategist thinks the Fed will end its tightening campaign sooner than later. Market guru Mike Wilson kicked off this week by telling investors to anticipate a stock rally because the central bank's about to ease up on interest rates.
In a Monday note from Morgan Stanley, Wilson pointed out the recent inversion of the 3-month and 10-year US Treasury yield curves as reason to support a Fed pivot.
Wilson sees a 6.4% upside for the S&P 500, in part because the major indexes closed last week in the green despite horrendous earnings coming out of Big Tech.
Yesterday, JPMorgan's trading desk echoed Wilson's optimism but under slightly different circumstances. Should policymakers opt for a surprising, smaller move of 50 basis points at the end of today's meeting, investors should gear up for the S&P 500 to soar as much as 10%.
Stocks could jump if the Fed shows its taking the foot off the gas, the analysts said, and a double-digit rally would have markets testing its previous record one-day surge last seen in 2008.
But JPMorgan's upbeat outlook didn't quite seem to make it over to Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs. That bank thinks the Fed is going to skirt any talk of a pivot, and opt for continued rate hikes albeit at a slower pace.
The December meeting, Goldman strategists said Tuesday, will feature a 50-basis-point move that won't signal anything near the end of the tightening cycle.
""We are adding another 25bp hike to our own forecast — which now calls for hikes of 75bp in November, 50bp in December, 25bp in February, and 25bp in March — and now see the funds rate peaking at 4.75-5%,"" analysts said.
Goldman Sachs listed three reasons the Fed will carry on with rate hikes:
US inflation will remain ""sticky"" so a pivot won't be justified. A surging labor market and rising wages means the Fed will have to keep hiking rates. Keeping rate hikes going until March 2023 will set up the central bank for a future pivot.
Keep an eye out for the Fed's official announcement at 2:00 p.m ET.
When does the fed pivot or pause its rate hikes?
A) At today's meeting
B) At the December meeting
C) In Q1 2023
D) In Q2 2023 or beyond

49,Fed unleashes another big rate hike but hints at a pullback,2022-11-02T04:00:00Z,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve pumped up its benchmark interest rate Wednesday by three-quarters of a point for a fourth straight time but hinted that it could soon reduce the size of its rate hikes.,"Fed unleashes another big rate hike but hints at a pullback
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve pumped up its benchmark interest rate Wednesday by three-quarters of a point for a fourth straight time but hinted that it could soon reduce the size of its rate hikes.
The Fed’s move raised its key short-term rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%, its highest level in 15 years. It was the central bank’s sixth rate hike this year — a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive and heightened the risk of a recession.
But in a statement, the Fed suggested that it could soon shift to a more deliberate pace of rate increases. It said that in coming months it would consider the cumulative impact of its large rate hikes on the economy. It noted that its rate hikes take time to fully affect growth and inflation.
Those words indicated that the Fed’s policymakers may think borrowing costs are getting high enough to possibly slow the economy and reduce inflation. If so, that would suggest that they don’t need to raise rates as quickly as they have been doing.
Still, for now, the persistence of inflated prices and higher borrowing costs is pressuring American households and has undercut the ability of Democrats to campaign on the health of the job market as they try to keep control of Congress. Republican candidates have hammered Democrats on the punishing impact of inflation in the run-up to the midterm elections that will end Tuesday.
The Fed’s statement Wednesday was released after its latest policy meeting. Many economists expect Chair Jerome Powell to signal at a news conference that the Fed’s next expected rate hike in December may be only a half-point rather than three-quarters.
Typically, the Fed raises rates in quarter-point increments. But after having miscalculated in downplaying inflation last year as likely transitory, Powell has led the Fed to raise rates aggressively to try to slow borrowing and spending and ease price pressures.
Wednesday’s latest rate increase coincided with growing concerns that the Fed may tighten credit so much as to derail the economy. The government has reported that the economy grew last quarter, and employers are still hiring at a solid pace. But the housing market has cratered, and consumers are barely increasing their spending.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, surpassed 7% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported. Sales of existing homes have dropped for eight straight months.
Blerina Uruci, an economist at T. Rowe Price, suggested that falling home sales are “the canary in the coal mine” that demonstrate that the Fed’s rate hikes are weakening a highly interest-rate sensitive sector like housing. Uruci noted, though, that the Fed’s hikes haven’t yet meaningfully slowed much of the rest of the economy, particularly the job market or consumer demand.
“So long as those two components remain strong,” she said, the Fed’s policymakers “cannot count on inflation coming down” close to their 2% target within the next two years.
Several Fed officials have said recently that they have yet to see meaningful progress in their fight against rising costs. Inflation rose 8.2% in September from 12 months earlier, just below the highest rate in 40 years.
Still, the policymakers may feel they can soon slow the pace of their rate hikes because some early signs suggest that inflation could start declining in 2023. Consumer spending, squeezed by high prices and costlier loans, is barely growing. Supply chain snarls are easing, which means fewer shortages of goods and parts. Wage growth is plateauing, which, if followed by declines, would reduce inflationary pressures.
Yet the job market remains consistently strong, which could make it harder for the Fed to cool the economy and curb inflation. This week, the government reported that companies posted more job openings in September than in August. There are now 1.9 available jobs for each unemployed worker, an unusually large supply.
A ratio that high means that employers will likely continue to raise pay to attract and keep workers. Those higher labor costs are often passed on to customers in the form of higher prices, thereby fueling more inflation.
Ultimately, economists at Goldman Sachs expect the Fed’s policymakers to raise their key rate to nearly 5% by March. That is above what the Fed itself had projected in its previous set of forecasts in September.
Outside the United States, many other major central banks are also rapidly raising rates to try to cool inflation levels that are even higher than in the U.S.
Last week, the European Central Bank announced its second consecutive jumbo rate hike, increasing rates at the fastest pace in the euro currency’s history to try to curb inflation that soared to a record 10.7% last month.
Likewise, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates Thursday to try to ease consumer prices, which have risen at their fastest pace in 40 years, to 10.1% in September. Even as they raise rates to combat inflation, both Europe and the U.K. appear to be sliding toward recession.",https://www.wbrz.com/news/fed-unleashes-another-big-rate-hike-but-hints-at-a-pullback

Officials had widely signaled the move.
Wrapping up a two-day meeting in Washington, D.C., Fed officials voted to hike the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3.75 to 4 percent. The rate was pinned at near-zero as recently as March.
The Federal Reserve fired the latest supersize salvo in its fight against inflation, boosting the central bank’s benchmark lending rate to the highest level in nearly 15 years and hinting that the end of its campaign may be approaching.

In a statement released after the meeting, the Fed repeated language used previously that “ongoing increases” will likely be needed to bring rates to a level that returns inflation to its 2 percent target.
But it added a new sentence that some quickly read as suggesting that additional rate hikes might be smaller: “In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
Stock prices rallied on the news.
Central bank policy makers are seeking to end the country’s worst inflation outbreak in four decades by slowing the economy.
The housing market has cooled dramatically as mortgage rates have almost doubled to more than 7 percent. Business investment has dropped while the growth in consumer spending has slowed.
But the job market remains too tight for the Fed despite a moderation in hiring, and gains in wages haven’t been enough to keep up with inflation.

Payrolls at private employers climbed a higher-than-forecast 239,000 in October, according to a monthly survey by ADP Research Institute and the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. The Labor Department will issue its official jobs report for last month on Friday.
As the Fed throws ice water on the economy, the risk of recession and widespread job loses is mounting, according to economists. But allowing inflation to become a long-term scourge is a bigger threat.
“Unless inflation comes down, workers will not see meaningful increases in their purchasing power,” Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist and former US Treasury secretary, wrote recently in The Washington Post.
Fed chair Jerome Powell has vowed to get inflation back to the central bank’s longer-term target of 2 percent. Officials’ preferred gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, rose by 6.4 percent for the year through August.
Fed officials said in September that they expected the federal funds rate to rise to 4.6 percent this year and into 2023. Most economists, however, say the rate will have to go even higher.
The rate peaked at 5.25 percent before the Fed started slashing rates as the financial crisis hit in the fall of 2007, eventually reaching near-zero a year later.
Powell is set to hold a news conference at 2:30 this afternoon. His comments will be carefully parsed for clues on whether the central bank is prepared to scale back future rate increases.

The rate increase was approved unanimously by members of the Federal Open Market Committee, including Susan M. Collins, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

53,FOREX-Dollar sags as Fed decision looms; yen surges,2022-11-02T01:36:27Z,"The U.S. dollar slipped from near a one-week peak versus major peers on Wednesday, with traders on tenterhooks before a looming Federal Reserve rate decision that should also give clues on the future policy path.

The yen outperformed, seeing a sudden burst of strength mid-morning Japan time, with traders on alert for possible intervention around the Fed meeting. The dollar index - which gauges the greenback against a basket of six counterparts that includes the yen, euro and sterling - eased 0.14% to 111.33, but still not far below Tuesday's high of 111.78, which was the strongest level since Oct. 25.
The index rode a yo-yo overnight, dropping fast in the European open only to recover those losses after U.S. data pointed to continued price pressures, dampening speculation of a Fed pivot this year. U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose, suggesting wage growth remains elevated, while construction spending staged a surprise rebound. Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) on Wednesday, the fourth such increase in a row. But for the December meeting, the futures market is split on the odds of a 75- or 50-bps increase amid recent suggestions from Fed officials of a potential slowdown in the tightening pace.
""In the Fed's view, putting the U.S. into a recession is still a lesser evil than not tackling entrenched price pressures,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, wrote in a client note. ""It seems highly unlikely that the Fed will want to promote a positive reaction in risky assets, and the risks to markets in my mind are skewed to a hawkish reaction – equity up, bond yields and the USD lower.""
The dollar index has surged more than 15% this year as the Fed has hiked rates hard, crushing other currencies and heaping pressure on the global economy. The yen has been particularly vulnerable to dollar strength, spurring the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan to intervene to support the currency in September for the first time since 1998. Japanese authorities are widely considered to have waded in several times again in October to pull the yen back from 32-year lows just shy of 152 per dollar, although they declined to confirm any action.
On Wednesday, the Japanese currency jumped suddenly by about half a yen to 147.4 per dollar. It then extended those gains, with the dollar last down 0.55% at 147.40 yen. ""This doesn't look like intervention to me,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.
""On the three occasions that we know about, the BOJ intervened in enormous size and repeatedly, and if we were seeing intervention now - unless the pattern has changed - I would expect we would see much more significant movements that would be continuing now."" The euro edged up 0.15% to $0.9888, but still close to the previous session's one-week low at $0.98535.
Sterling rose 0.17% to $1.1505, but remained not far from Tuesday's one-week low of $1.14365. The Bank of England announces its policy decision on Thursday, and markets expect a 75-bps increase there as well, followed by a slowdown to a 50-bps pace in December.
The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.63945, consolidating near a one-week low. The Reserve Bank of Australia opted to keep its pace of rate hikes at 25bps on Tuesday, despite consumer inflation running at a 32-year high. The kiwi dollar rose 0.16% to $0.58485, garnering support after an upbeat jobs report reinforced the case for a super-sized increase in interest rates this month from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

Nov. 1 (UPI) -- The Federal Reserve's attempts to loosen up a tight jobs market and combat inflation did not stop a jump in job openings in September. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows 10.72 million job openings in the month of September. That equates to an increase of about half a million over August which outpaced projections. Advertisement
Hires reached 6.1 million while layoffs, discharges and people quitting was about 5.7 million.
September's gaudy job numbers are just 0.8% lower than than peak numbers in March. Hires were slightly less than August, as were separations, which includes layoffs, discharges and people who quit their jobs. Layoffs reduced by 0.9% to 1.3 million.
The bureau estimates there are about 1.9 jobs available per worker.
The JOLTS report is a measuring stick for federal policymakers, giving them a clue as to where the labor market is and where it is going. The surprising increase in September will not change the plans to institute yet another 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve, likely by the end of this week. It will be the sixth interest rate increase of the year.
