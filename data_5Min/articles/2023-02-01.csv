The Fed is widely seen as raising its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in its first policy meeting of the year, after rapid increases in 2022 to tame decades-high inflation. Money markets are betting on one more 25 basis point (bps) hike in March, and a terminal rate of 4.9% in June.
""It's really boiling down to a longer term outlook beyond this policy meeting and where this peak terminal rate with Fed funds is going to be,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. Recent readings have indicated that inflation is easing, with the Fed also looking at data that will determine the resilience of the labor market and the pace of wage growth.
Meanwhile, data showed U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in December ahead of the Labor Department's comprehensive report on nonfarm payrolls for January due on Friday. Separately, data showed U.S. manufacturing contracted further in January as higher interest rates stifled demand for goods.
""It's going to come down to the narrow line between avoiding a recession and entering a recession. That's the Fed's issue as they finish up their two-day policy meeting today,"" Turnquist added. All three indexes had a strong start to the year, with the S&P and the Dow witnessing their first gain for January since 2019 as investors returned to markets, which were bruised in the previous year by a hawkish Fed.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc added 8.0% as the semiconductor maker said it expects its business to improve in the second half of the year, propping the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which climbed 1.8%. All of the 11 major sectors on the S&P 500 were down, with technology shares falling the least.
Snap Inc tumbled 14.2% after the social media company said it expects current-quarter revenue to decline by as much as 10%. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc dipped 0.1% ahead of reporting fourth-quarter results after the bell.
At 12:21 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 381.36 points, or 1.12%, at 33,704.68, the S&P 500 was down 25.69 points, or 0.63%, at 4,050.91, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 51.42 points, or 0.44%, at 11,533.13. Dow component Amgen Inc dropped 4.8% as the drugmaker said its fourth-quarter revenue fell slightly, while videogame publisher Electronic Arts Inc slumped 12.0% on lowering its annual bookings forecast.
Seventy percent of the 200 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported fourth-quarter earnings have topped Wall Street expectations. Analysts now see earnings of S&P 500 firms declining 2.4% for the quarter, per Refinitiv estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 75 new highs and 21 new lows.

1,Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates for first time this year,2023-02-01T17:44:21Z,The Federal Reserve is set to announce its first interest rate increase of 2023 on Wednesday afternoon.,"Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates for first time this year
The Federal Reserve is set to announce its first policy decision of the year at 2:00 p.m. ET.
Investors expect the central bank will announce a 0.25% increase in the range for its benchmark policy rate, marking the second time the Fed slowed down its pace of rate increases in as many meetings.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold a press conference explaining the Fed's decision at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, several Fed officials have socialized the concept of a 25 basis point rate increase, and investors in turn priced in a nearly 100% chance of this move with today's announcement.
In Powell's press conference, investors will be listening closely for clues on whether the Fed has moved any closer to ending its campaign of rate hikes as it works to slow down inflation. In 2022, the Fed raised interest rates by a cumulative 4.25%, its most aggressive annual campaign since the early 1980s.

""Fed Chair Powell will need to acknowledge encouraging inflation data that's come in,"" Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley told Yahoo Finance last week. ""This is not a one off. We have had had three months of encouraging data.""
Tilley thinks despite encouraging inflation data, the Fed will use hawkish language on Wednesday because officials don't want financial conditions to loosen too much and are still watching wages.
""Powell wants to stay the course and do no harm,"" he said.

Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to announce a quarter point increase on the benchmark interest rate Wednesday following the first policy meeting of the year for the U.S. Federal Reserve. Wall Street braced for a 0.25-point rate increase after the nation's central bank took more aggressive moves on interest over the past year, increasing rates by half a point in December, preceded by four other 0.75-point rate hikes due to persistent inflation.

Inflation has slowed and the stock market has looked resilient for several months, with many economists crediting the Fed's recent actions as several key economic indicators show inflation easing after peaking last October.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by more than 200 points Wednesday in anticipation of the 2 p.m. announcement, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Powell, who was not expected to provide any new economic forecasts for the nation.

Wary investors were expecting a less severe hike this time around, which would put the federal funds rate target at 4.5% to 4.75%, up from the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. A year ago, the benchmark rate was near zero.
Wednesday's move also would amount to the smallest rate hike by the Fed since last March.
At the last central bank meeting in December, the Fed raised interest rates by another half a percentage point, bringing the benchmark interest rate to the highest point in 15 years. At the time, the panel of governors projected interest rates would climb above 5% and remain there for all of 2023.
Previously, several central bank officials indicated the pace of interest rate hikes would slow as the economy begins to settle from the current conditions.
""There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase at the FOMC's next meeting at the end of this month,"" Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this month.
For now, inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target rate but has shown some signs of weakening in recent months, with government data showing a year-over-year drop in inflation in December, which was the slowest rate of increase in more than a year.

In another good sign, the Wholesale Producer Price Index inflation dropped by 0.5% in December, and PPI inflation was 6.2% in 2022 compared to 10% in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And almost half of that wholesale inflation decrease was from a 13.4% drop in gasoline prices.
Federal data published last week on personal income and spending showed some of the inflationary strains are starting to catch up with consumers, though it's unlikely the world's largest economy will experience a major recession.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the Commerce Department, reported personal income increased by 0.2% in December to $49.6 billion, disposable income increased by 0.3% to $49.2 billion, but spending took a hit, declining by 0.2% from November levels to $41.6 billion.
Financial experts said the latest economic data might lead the Fed to acknowledge that inflation was finally slowing and the economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but Powell was also known to be predictably measured in his words to head off volatility on Wall Street.
""Fed Chair Powell will need to acknowledge encouraging inflation data that's come in,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley. ""This is not a one off. We have had had three months of encouraging data.""

Some insiders said they believed the central bank would keep this latest hike in place for the remainder of the year, while other insiders said they would be listening for any indication of when the Fed could potentially scrap the ongoing rate increases down the road.
""There could be one last hawkish sting in the tail,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect [Wednesday's] statement to maintain the language that 'ongoing increases' (emphasis on the plural) in rates will be required and, to counter the recent easing in financial conditions, forward guidance could be added that commits to leaving rates at elevated levels for some time.""
Still, across the wider landscape of the American economy there remained many other troubling signs.
Several big tech giants have announced massive layoffs in recent months while consumer spending ability has been decimated by the high price of gas and utilities.
Consumer-level inflation is cooling off from the double-digit levels that gripped the U.S. economy during summer 2022, but prices, particularly at the grocery store, remain stubbornly high, with eggs in particular experiencing an exponential gain in prices at the retail level.
The core consumer price index -- which tracks longterm inflation but excludes food and energy costs -- grew by 0.3% in December after increasing 0.2% the previous month.

3,Fed Set for Smaller Rate Increase: Live Updates,2023-02-01T17:04:33Z,"In their first meeting of the year, Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to raise rates by a quarter point, a smaller increase than in recent meetings. But what they say about their next moves is more important for consumers, businesses and markets.","Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise.
As the Federal Reserve has lifted its key interest rate several times over the past year, Americans have seen the effects on both sides of the household ledger: Savers benefit from higher yields, but borrowers pay more.
Here’s how it works:
Credit Cards
Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise, usually within one or two billing cycles. The average credit card rate was 19.9 percent as of Jan. 25, according to Bankrate.com, up from around 16 percent in March last year, when the Fed began its series of rate increases.
Car Loans
Car loans tend to track the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate — but that’s not the only factor that determines how much you’ll pay.
A borrower’s credit history, the type of vehicle, loan term and down payment are all baked into that rate calculation. The average interest rate on new-car loans was 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year, according to Edmunds, up from 4.1 percent in the same period a year earlier.
Student Loans
Whether the rate increase will affect your student loan payments depends on the type of loan you have.
The rate for current federal student loan borrowers — many of whom will see up to $20,000 in loans canceled under a Department of Education program, subject to legal challenges — aren’t affected because those loans carry a fixed rate set by the government.
But new batches of federal loans are priced each July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May. Rates on those loans have already jumped: Borrowers with federal undergraduate loans disbursed after July 1 (and before July 1, 2023) will pay 4.99 percent, up from 3.73 percent for loans disbursed the year-earlier period.
Borrowers of private student loans should also expect to pay more: Both fixed- and variable-rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate. Those increases usually show up within a month.
Mortgages
Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark rate, but instead generally track the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations around inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react to all of it.
After climbing above 7 percent in November, for the first time since 2002, mortgage rates had fallen to 6.13 percent in the week through Jan. 26, according to Freddie Mac. The average rate for an identical loan was 3.55 percent the same week in 2021.
Other home loans are more closely tethered to the Fed’s move. Home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages — which each carry variable interest rates — generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed’s rates.
Savings Vehicles
Savers seeking a better return on their money will have an easier time — yields have been rising, but not uniformly.
An increase in the Fed’s key rate often means banks will pay more interest on their deposits, though it doesn’t always happen right away. They tend to raise their rates when they want to bring more money in — many banks already had plenty of deposits, but that may be changing at some institutions.
Primis Bank, for example, recently introduced online savings and checking accounts with a 5.03 percent rate. But rates at many of the larger online banks — including Ally, American Express, Capital One, Discover and Marcus — were still 3.3 percent, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, part of LendingTree.
“I expect some more upward movement after today’s Fed rate hike,” Mr. Tumin said, “but it appears online banks are generally not in a rush to hike their deposit rates now.”
Rates on certificates of deposit, which tend to track similarly dated Treasury securities, have been ticking higher. The average one-year C.D. at online banks was 4.4 percent at the start of January, up from 0.5 percent a year earlier, according to DepositAccounts.com.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/02/01/business/fed-interest-rates-inflation

The expected increase is the eighth in a series begun in March 2022 aimed at curbing high inflation.

5,U.S. job market openings rise to 11 million in December,2023-02-01T16:53:31Z,"U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, delivering a setback to the Federal Reserve's effort to cool a hot job market.","Paul Wiseman , The Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, delivering a setback to the Federal Reserve's effort to cool a hot job market.
Openings were up from 10.44 million in November and were the highest since July, according to data released Wednesday by the Labor Department. Economists had expected job openings to drop slightly in December.
For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000. The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.
Employers hired 6.17 million workers in December, up from 6.03 million in November.
Still, layoffs and discharges blipped up to 1.47 million in December from 1.42 million in November. And the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign they have confidence they can find a better opportunities elsewhere — fell slightly in December.
Hotels, restaurants and bars accounted for more than 70% of the December increase in job openings.
The American job market has been surprisingly resilient throughout this period of economic uncertainty.
Employers created 375,000 jobs a month in 2022 — second most in Labor Department records dating back to 1940 — and likely added another 185,000 last month, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. January's hiring numbers come out Friday.
Hiring has remained strong even in the face of rising interest rates, which can increase costs for businesses. Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and is expected to announce another rate hike later Wednesday.
Fed policymakers are aiming for a soft landing — slowing the economy enough to contain inflation without causing much economic pain. One hope was that that employers would cut job openings — and ease upward pressure on wages that can feed inflation — and without actually cutting many jobs.
“With Fed officials hoping for signs of slowing hiring to support wage growth deceleration, every data point matters,'' said Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “The December report unfortunately offered the opposite ... showcasing the stubborn resiliency of the labor market.''
Many economists believe the Fed rate hikes will slow the economy enough to cause a recession later this year.",https://www.cp24.com/world/job-market-still-hot-december-openings-rise-to-11-million-1.6255294

12,"Sooner or later, Fed may need technical tweaks for rate control toolkit",2023-02-01T16:35:24Z,"If the Federal Reserve really wants to move some of the mountain of cash now residing in its overnight reverse repo facility, technical changes in its rate control toolkit would do the trick, some central bank watchers say.","NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - If the Federal Reserve really wants to move some of the mountain of cash now residing in its overnight reverse repo facility, technical changes in its rate control toolkit would do the trick, some central bank watchers say.
The tweaks they envision are not shifts in the federal funds target rate, the central bank’s main tool for influencing the economy to achieve its job and inflation goals. Instead, it comes down to changing the setting of two other rates relative to the fed funds range in a way that departs from recent practice but could nudge money market funds to seek another home for some of the $2 trillion a day now deposited at the Fed.
Those two rates exist to keep the market-driven fed funds rate in the desired range. One, called the reverse repo rate, sets a floor underneath short-term rates, while another, which pays deposit-taking banks to park cash at the Fed, sets the high end.
The reverse repo facility takes in cash from money market funds and other eligible firms, and currently pays an annualized rate of 4.30% for overnight loans of cash, compared to the current federal funds rate range of between 4.25% and 4.5%.
The Fed is widely expected to raise the target rate to 4.5% to 4.75% at Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. If it sticks to recent practice, it will raise the reverse repo and the interest on reserve balances rate, now at 4.4%, by the same 25 basis point increment.
TWEAK NOW OR LATER
But some Fed watchers say the central bank has a choice, one it could take this week or later. And if it does do a tweak now, it would be unlike past tweaks. Those adjustments happened purely to ensure control of the fed funds rate, while this sort of move would speak more directly to bigger monetary policy concerns around managing the size of its $8.5 trillion balance sheet.
The reverse repo facility has seen sustained inflows of over $2 trillion per day since last June and has failed to contract as many policymakers expected. On many days, the facility offers the highest overnight rate available to many firms, so it’s a no brainer for them to skip the private market and park cash at the Fed.
“If [policymakers] wanted a small balance sheet, they could reduce the overnight [reverse repo rate]” relative to the federal funds rate “and that would drive money out of overnight [reverse repo,] drive it into reserves,” which would in turn give them more space to cut the size of their balance sheet, said William English, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management who is formerly a top Federal Reserve staff member.
Given the strong chance of a quarter percentage point increase Wednesday, Bill Nelson, who is also a former top Fed staffer and now serves as chief economist with Bank Policy Institute, said the Fed could once again make the reverse repo rate match the bottom end of the new federal funds rate range, with the interest on reserves rate matching the top.
Doing this change now ""would probably be easier to explain and less newsworthy than making the change at some other time or to some other configuration,” Nelson said.
The Fed has tweaked the relative rate settings several times since adopting its so-called abundant-reserves approach after the financial crisis, and pursuing Nelson’s suggestion would mark the first time since June 2018 that the interest on reserves and reverse repo rates were set to match the upper and lower bounds of the fed funds range.
Some in the market fear rate control toolkit tweaks might create unneeded headaches if done too aggressively. Scott Skyrm, of money market trading firm Curvature Securities, warned that should the Fed straight up hold the reverse repo rate at 4.3%, which would be unlikely, ""it would create a severe dislocation in overnight rates…Imagine $2 trillion entering the repo market over a course of a few days.”
Instead, Skrym expects the Fed to bump the two rates up by the same amount as the federal funds rate on Wednesday, in line with its recent practice.

13,U.S. job openings increase to five-month high; manufacturing slumps,2023-02-01T16:35:24Z,"U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in December, showing demand for labor remains strong despite higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession, which could keep the Federal Reserve on its policy tightening path.","Summary Job openings increase 572,000 to 11 million in December
Manufacturing activity slumps further in January
Private payrolls increase by 106,000 in January
WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in December, showing demand for labor remains strong despite higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession, which could keep the Federal Reserve on its policy tightening path.
There were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in December, the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed on Wednesday. Signs of persistent labor tightness were unlikely to change expectations that the U.S. central bank would further slow the pace of its rate hikes when policymakers concluded a two-day meeting later on Wednesday.
""This could well be the first recession in history without material job losses,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""It's a good thing for the Fed that inflation pressures are cooling because the labor market isn't cooling at all.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 572,000 to a five-month high of 11.0 million on the last day of December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.250 million job openings.
Accommodation and food services led the increase in job openings, with unfilled jobs rising by 409,000. Employment in the industry remains below its pre-pandemic level. There were 134,000 more openings in retail trade.
Construction, which has been hammered by higher borrowing costs, had 82,000 additional vacancies.
The job openings rate up shot to 6.7% from 6.4% in November. Hiring increased to 6.2 million from 6.0 million. The hires rate rose to 4.0% from 3.9% in November. The gap between job openings and hiring suggests wage growth could remain elevated, though it cooled in the fourth quarter.
JOLTS
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise its policy rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday. The Fed last year raised its policy rate by 425 basis points from the near-zero level to a 4.25%-4.50% range, the highest since late 2007.
Aggressive monetary policy tightening has left economists expecting a recession by the second half of the year. The housing market has slumped and the downturn in manufacturing is intensifying.
A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed its manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.4 in January from 48.4 in December. The third straight monthly contraction pushed the index to the lowest level since May 2020 and below the 48.7 mark viewed as consistent with a recession in the broader economy.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
ISM PMI
LAYOFFS LOW
Despite the deterioration in conditions, factories did not appear to be laying off workers in large numbers. That was reinforced by the JOLTS report, which showed layoffs climbing to 1.5 million in December from 1.4 million in November. The layoffs rate edged up to 1.0% from 0.9% in November.
Workers also continued to voluntarily quit their jobs in December. The quits rates, which is viewed as a measure of labor market confidence, was unchanged at 2.7%.
A third report showed private employment increased by 106,000 jobs last month after rising by 253,000 in December, well below economists' expectations for a gain of 178,000. The ADP National Employment report, however, attributed the weaker-than-expected private payrolls gain to bad weather in mid-January, including flooding in California.
The ADP report, jointly developed with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, was published ahead of the release on Friday of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for January. The ADP report has been a poor predictor of private payrolls in the Labor Department employment report.
""The muted increase in the ADP measure of private payroll employment will add to fears that the malaise in activity has spread to the labor market,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""We would still urge caution about relying too much on the ADP measure, particularly in January when firms purge payroll records of employees who may not have worked for months.""
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in January after rising by 223,000 in December.

14,"Fed opts for small rate hikes, expects to deliver 'ongoing increases'",2023-02-01T16:35:24Z,"The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, yet continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its still unresolved battle against inflation.","NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, yet continued to promise ""ongoing increases"" in borrowing costs as part of its still unresolved battle against inflation.
The decision lifted the benchmark overnight interest rate to a range between 4.50% and 4.75%, a move widely anticipated by investors and flagged by U.S. central bankers ahead of this week's two-day policy session.
MARKET REACTION:
STOCKS: U.S. stocks fell after the Fed statement, but the Nasdaq recovered, last flat on the day. BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields trimmed losses after the Fed decision; 10-year last down at 3.48%. FOREX: The U.S. dollar pared losses after the Fed statement.
COMMENTS:
MICHELE RANERI, VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF U.S. RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, TRANSUNION, CHICAGO
""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back. Consumers will likely continue to feel the double-edged effects of both continued inflation and high interest rates for at least a while longer and may seek to shed high interest-debt via personal loans or other lower-interest loan products.""
ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target. They are specifically looking at the non-housing services portion of the PCE and as long as wages are still growing at 5-ish% you are not going to see the Fed back off.""
""One thing that struck me about the statement is that they had a very slightly dovish change in the language where they previously had talked about determining the pace of future increases and now they are talking about determining the extent of future increases. So they did 25, the market is pricing in two more 25s, that is probably right but the question is going to be what is the terminal rate, when do they stop and when do they start to cut again. But what they have said here is this is a little more dovish than it might have been because they are not talking about the pace anymore.""
""This basically takes 50 off the table, not that it was necessarily on, but the language last time could have defended 50 and now that is off the table. They have to see those wages come down.""
RYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CARSON GROUP, OMAHA
""The Fed threw no curve balls, as they did what was widely expected. The door is cracking open to end rate hikes, but they still have a chance for one more rate hike at the next meeting.""
""The economy is still growing, which is comforting as (the Fed is) not worried of an impending recession.""
""Investors should be happy that we likely have a Fed that is going to end hikes fairly soon as the inflation data continues to show major improvements, which is exactly what the Fed needs to take their foot off the pedal.""
""Yesterday's Employment Cost Index was an improvement, and Powell said he needed to see employment costs improve before he stops hiking rates. How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?""

16,Job openings unexpectedly rose in December to 11 million,2023-02-01T16:15:00Z,American labor market remains hot despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool it down.,"U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in December, a sign the American labor market remains hot and a blow to the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool it down.
Openings in December rose to 11 million, up from 10.4 million in November, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Economists had expected job openings to drop slightly in December. The rate of layoffs and employees quitting both ticked up slightly that month.
""With 76.4 million Americans starting new jobs, 2022 is the year with the largest number of completed hires on record,""Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, said in a note. By contrast, layoffs last year came in at just three-quarters of their typical level—despite a spate of layoff announcements from tech companies.
The American job market has been surprisingly resilient throughout this period of economic uncertainty. The latest figures put additional pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has been trying to slow the labor market with interest-rate hikes.
Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and is expected to announce another rate increase later Wednesday.

Investors parsed a host of economic data that gave mixed signals, while also weighing quarterly results from major companies.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) was 0.49% lower to 11,528.09 points in morning trade, while the benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) slipped 0.53% to 4,055.14 points.
The Dow (DJI) underperformed the other two averages, falling 0.98% to 33,751.48 points. The blue-chip index was weighed down by a fall in shares of Amgen.
All 11 S&P sectors were trading in the red, with Energy falling the most and Health Care falling the least.
Wall Street's three major indices closed out the month of January in the previous session with hefty gains, after slumping in 2022. Following the gloom and doom of last year, investors have piled back into equities with the hopes that the Fed is at the end of or nearing the end of its policy tightening cycle.
The markets are widely expecting the central bank to slow down its pace of rate hikes to a 25 basis point increase today. The bigger question on the mind of investors is whether this will be the Fed's final rate hike. Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision comments should throw some light on that matter.
""After a very positive January, the start of February today marks a pivotal three days for markets that have the potential to decisively set the tone for the weeks ahead,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid wrote.
""The last time we had a big round of central bank meetings like this in December, the rate hikes themselves were much as expected, but the hawkish rhetoric alongside them led to a big selloff,"" Reid said. ""Nevertheless, the mood going into this round is much more optimistic, with the S&P 500 closing at a 2-month high after the US Employment Cost Index numbers showed labor costs grew by less-than-expected.""
The benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) ended more than 6% higher for January on Tuesday, hitting the so-called ""January Indicator Trifecta"" which gives the index close to a 100% historical probability of posting gains in 2023 as a whole.
On Wednesday, a deluge of economic data especially on the labor market painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy. On the one hand, ADP's January private payrolls data moderated, while on the other, December JOLTS data showed an unexpected climb in job openings.
""The survey response rate for this (JOLTS) data has collapsed, making the quality questionable,"" UBS' Paul Donovan said. ""The vacancy number does not report actual vacancies, only externally advertised vacancies. Hiring rates are very high, suggesting a lot of the 'vacancy' rise post pandemic has been about people changing company.""
Additionally, the S&P Global manufacturing PMI for January came in at 46.9 compared to the forecasted 46.8 figure and 46.8 prior level.
Turning to the bond markets, yields were slightly lower. The 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) fell 3 basis points to 3.50% and the 2-year yield (US2Y) fell 1 basis point to 4.20%.
Earnings news was also in the spotlight on Wednesday. Amgen (AMGN) slipped after a mixed quarterly report. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts (EA) and Match Group (MTCH) were among the top percentage losers on the S&P 500 (SP500) after disappointing results.
Conversely, Stryker (SYK), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Altria (MO) were among the top S&P percentage gainers after their financial reports.

Traders keep buzzing about the gap between what Powell and company have been saying (We are going to keep raising rates, and we are going to keep them higher for longer.) and what the market believes ( The Fed will raise rates a quarter point in February, another quarter point in March, then stop, and will likely lower rates slightly by the end of the year). The money is with the traders: Fed funds futures are at roughly 5% for June, and about 4.5% in December, indicating the market believes the central bank will start cutting by the end of the year. What can Powell say that can finally convince the markets that he will not be lowering rates? Not much. The market expects him to be hawkish. If inflation, particularly wage inflation, continues to move lower, the market will believe Powell is winning the fight against inflation. But the market also believes the Fed will be doing damage to the economy by holding rates at levels above 5% and will be forced to move rates lower toward the end of the year.

The Fed's two-day policy meeting concludes Wednesday, with a rate policy decision at 2 p.m. ET, followed by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed is widely expected to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%. Another quarter-point increase is expected in March, which would bring the Fed funds rate very close to the Fed's terminal rate of 5% to 5.25%. That's where the Fed thinks it can pause rate hikes to let prior increases work their way through the economy.
ADP's employment report came out at 8:15 a.m. ET. January payrolls came in at 106,000, below the 158,000 estimate and down from 235,000 in the previous month. ADP's report is a precursor to Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department.

28,Fed Raises Interest Rates by Another Quarter Point,2023-02-01T14:00:06Z,The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point.,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication that it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle.
Aligning with market expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point. That takes it to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007.
The move marked the eighth increase in a process that began in March 2022. By itself, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, but it also spills through to many consumer debt products.
The Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s.
The post-meeting statement noted that inflation ""has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" a tweak on previous language.
Markets, however, were looking to this week's meeting for signs that the Fed would be ending the rate increases soon. But the statement provided no such signals. Stocks sold off in the wake of the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 300 points.
The document included language noting that the FOMC still sees the need for ""ongoing increases in the target range."" Market participants had been hoping for some softening of the phrase, but the statement, approved unanimously, kept it intact.
The statement did alter one part when describing what will determine the future policy path.
Officials said they would determine the ""extent"" of future rate increases based on factors such as the effects so far of the rate hikes, the lags in which policy has an impact, and developments in financial conditions and the economy. Previously, the statement said it would use those factors to determine the ""pace"" of future hikes, a possible nod that the committee sees an end to the increases somewhere, or at least a continuation of smaller moves ahead.
In 2022, the Fed approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves before going to a smaller 0.5 percentage point increase in December. In recent public statements, multiple officials said they think the Fed at least can scale back on the size of the increases, without signaling when they could end.
While it was raising its benchmark rate, the committee characterized economic growth as ""modest"" though it noted only that unemployment ""has remained low."" The latest job market assessment omitted previous language that employment gains have been ""robust.""
Otherwise, the statement remained intact from previous messages as the Fed continues its efforts to arrest inflation.
Fed policy is thought to work on a lag – when the central bank raises rates, it takes time for the economy to adjust to tighter controls on money.
This particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services. The war in Ukraine aggravated rising gas prices, while unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus fueled rising costs across a variety of goods and services.
Food prices have risen more than 10% over the past year. Egg prices alone have soared 60%, butter is up more than 31% and lettuce has jumped 25%, according to Labor Department data through December. Gas prices were ticking lower towards the end of 2022 but have popped higher in recent days, hitting $3.50 a gallon nationally for an increase of about 30 cents over the past month, according to AAA.
Fed officials have remained resolute about tackling inflation, though they have said recent numbers show pressures could be easing. The consumer price index declined 0.1% in December on a monthly basis and is up 6.4% from a year ago – down from the peak of 9% last summer but still well above where the Fed feels comfortable.
Along with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the holdings in its bond portfolio. That has resulted in a reduction of about $445 billion since June, as the Fed has targeted a capped level of $95 billion in maturing bonds it is allowing to roll off each month rather than reinvest.
The balance sheet reduction has been the equivalent of about 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes, according to the San Francisco Fed. The balance sheet is still at more than $8.4 trillion.
Markets are watching for where the Fed will finally end the increases.
At the December FOMC meeting, committee members indicated they see the ""terminal rate,"" or point where the Fed thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, as 5.1%. Markets are betting that number is closer to 4.75%, and they expect the Fed to start cutting rates later this year, after one more quarter-point increase in March.

30,Investors Hope the Fed Won’t Dampen 2023’s Big Rally,2023-02-01T13:12:22Z,"Stocks and bonds are on an impressive run so far this year, driven by hopes the Federal Reserve will slow down, or even pause, its interest rate increases.","Investors brace for decision day
After last month’s stock run for the ages, market watchers will look closely at what the Fed does on Wednesday with interest rates, hoping that Jay Powell and his colleagues don’t pour cold water on the rally.
Markets expect the Fed to raise the prime lending rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a new target range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent. That would mark “the first ‘normal’ sized hike since March 2022,” when the central bank began its big anti-inflation push, the Deutsche Bank analysts Jim Reid and Henry Allen wrote to investors this morning.
The big question is what comes down the line. Investors will parse the forthcoming announcement by the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee for signs of an approaching slowdown, or even pause, in interest rate increases. The key word is “ongoing” — as in, whether the committee still feels that “ongoing increases” in interest rates are necessary given signs in recent data that inflation is cooling.
For investors, that data has been a signal to buy. The U.S.’s three major stock indexes rose on Tuesday, after stats showed that wages were moderating even as hiring remained strong. Tuesday’s data was enough to push the S&P 500 to a two-month high, as investors anticipated the Fed might ease up on rate increases.",https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/business/dealbook/markets-fed-rates-stocks-bonds.html

Washington CNN —
Investors appear to be preparing for another match-up against their favorite sparring partners at the Federal Reserve today.
Fed officials are hoping they’ll be able to ease up on the pace of interest hikes without having to signal any immediate plans to stop. Wall Street, meanwhile, is convinced that the central bank will soon abandon its rate hike regimen.
So will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has a way to go, or will the Fed show signs that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes? Tune in at around 2 p.m.
What’s happening: Stocks have rallied this month, The S&P 500 just closed out its best January since 2019 (back when Corona was just a beer, not a virus) largely due to inflation data that encouraged investors to expect a pivot from the Fed.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point, the smallest rate hike since last March, at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday. Wall Street analysts also expect the Fed will stop hiking altogether by the spring.
Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation. Defiant investors are counting on a pivot. They may be in for a let down this week.
“Investors seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of ‘Don’t Fight the Fed.’ Perhaps this week will serve as a reminder,” wrote Michael Wilson and a team of economists at Morgan Stanley in a recent note.
Investors are looking for clarity on where rates are going but they’re unlikely to find it during the Fed policy announcement, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US.
“At the conclusion of this week’s FOMC meeting, we expect the Fed will leave the market hanging on the question of the future of rate hikes and how many we will see,” Donabedian wrote in a note. “We expect the Fed to indicate they have more work to do. They will continue their stubbornness in fighting inflation, hesitant to declare victory just yet. This will leave the market hanging on the future of how many rate hikes we will see.”
He’s preparing for a volatile market reaction.
A final thought: Sick patients are often advised by their doctors to finish an entire course of antibiotics even if they feel better, because they risk relapsing or prolonging the illness if they don’t.
The same can be said of how the Federal Reserve handles the economy.
Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working.
But now, investors may be a bit too eager to end treatment, even as Fed officials warn that doing so would be premature.
Stocks close out a jubilant January
The greatest comebacks of all time: Rocky Balboa, JNCO jeans, Apple and now… the US stock market.
US stocks are off to a very strong start in 2023 following last year’s abysmal showing.
The Dow gained nearly 3% in January. The S&P 500 rose 6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared almost 11%. That’s the Nasdaq’s best month since July reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica.
The rally is largely built on hopes that inflation pressures are starting to abate. That should allow the Fed to issue smaller rate increases — and possibly even pause them later this year.
There’s a growing sense on Wall Street that the US economy may avoid a recession and instead wind up slowing to a so-called soft landing, a gradual slide in economic conditions that doesn’t lead to a massive spike in the unemployment rate or a major pullback in consumer spending.
The bottom line: There’s a strongly held belief amongst investors that stock performance in the first month of the year predicts performance for the rest of the year.
That may be so, but the pace of the rally has left some investors skeptical about its sustainability, especially with a Fed policy decision, fourth quarter earnings reports from corporate titans and a jobs report ahead of us.
US home prices continue to drop
US home prices dropped for the fifth month in a row in November, reports my colleague Anna Bahney.
Rising mortgage rates pushed prospective buyers out of the housing market late last year and prices continued to cool, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, released Tuesday.
Last July marked the first month-over-month decrease for the national index since February 2012 and that continued through November, with seasonally adjusted prices falling 0.3% month over month.
Still, inventory of available homes to buy remains the stubborn sticking point for many buyers. Many current homeowners are hesitant to sell when they have very attractive rates under 4% and buying a new home would mean getting a much higher rate.
“Home shoppers are still going to find limited supply in the market and affordability is still a major challenge, particularly for first-time homebuyers,” Lisa Sturtevant, Bright MLS chief economist said. “The persistent lack of inventory, exacerbated by this ‘rate lock,’ is the main reason why we should expect prices to be stable or even rise in the year ahead.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/01/investing/premarket-stocks-trading

Follow along for live updates leading up to the interest rate decision and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's news conference.,"Fed meeting today: Live updates as Federal Reserve expected to raise rates by quarter of a point
The Federal Reserve will announce its first interest rate decision of the year this afternoon.
The central bank is expected to raise its short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point, a slowing of last year's aggressive pace of hikes. It would be the eighth increase since the Fed began its tightening cycle in March 2022. The ratcheting back of rates comes as painful price increases ease in the U.S., with annual inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index declining for the sixth consecutive month in December to 6.5%.
The Fed hasn't raised interest rates since March 2022 . Traditionally the Fed raises interest rates by quarter percentage point increments, but persistently high inflation pushed it to act more aggressively.
Over the course of 2022, the Fed passed four 75-basis-point rate hikes. Rate hikes of that magnitude hadn't previously occurred since 1994. The Fed's cumulative rate hikes last year raised the benchmark federal-funds rate by 4.25%.
At this time last year, economists questioned why the Fed didn't start raising interest rates. But now they're wondering when the Fed will stop as it walks a shaky tightrope between lowering inflation to its 2% target and pushing the economy into recession.

35,U.S. Federal Reserve expected to deliver small rate hike but keep anti-inflation tilt,2023-02-01T12:14:08Z,"The expected increase would set the U.S. central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.50%-4.75% range, the highest since November 2007","The U.S. Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on July 31, 2013.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, setting aside the rapid hikes used last year to curb a surge in inflation in favour of a more stepwise hunt for a stopping point.
The expected increase would set the U.S. central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.50 per cent-4.75 per cent range, the highest since November 2007, when the economy was on the eve of what would prove to be a long and deep recession.
Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs.
The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later to elaborate on the decision.
“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”
Ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting this week, the International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for a global economy that its officials said had proved “surprisingly resilient” in the face of monetary policy tightening and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
Caught flat-footed last year as inflation accelerated and threatened to prove far more persistent than anticipated, the Fed approved the fastest interest rate hikes since the 1980s. Starting with a quarter-percentage-point increase in March, the central bank by the summer was raising rates in increments of three quarters of a percentage point, and all told moved the target policy rate up by 4.25 percentage points in just 10 months. It delivered a half-percentage-point hike at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.
The impact of the policy moves seems to be gaining steam. New data last week showed a key inflation measure slowed faster than expected in December, continuing a six-month downward trend. Growth in employment costs, closely watched as a possible indicator of future price increases, also slowed in the fourth quarter.
But the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, still rose at a 5 per cent annual rate in December, down from a June high of nearly 7 per cent but still more than double the central bank’s 2 per cent inflation target.
Policy-makers are adamant they will not make what they consider to be the crucial error of pausing further rate hikes until they are convinced inflation is on a durable path back to the 2 per cent goal.
Some analysts do expect the Fed to remove from its policy statement the current, open-ended promise of “ongoing increases” in interest rates, a phrase used since the central bank began its tightening cycle in March. Any new language, however, would still leave the door open for further increases depending on incoming economic data, particularly on inflation and jobs.
The expected move to 25-basis-point rate increases will be a “hawkish downshift,” BNP Paribas economists wrote ahead of this week’s policy meeting. “While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year.
As of December, policy-makers’ median forecast was for the Fed’s target interest rate to peak in a range between 5.00 per cent and 5.25 per cent, an outlook that would imply a pause in the policy tightening after two more quarter-percentage-point increases.
Traders of futures that settle to the Fed’s policy rate see the path somewhat differently, with the benchmark rate peaking in the 4.75 per cent-5.00 per cent range, and the central bank cutting that rate to around 4.4 per cent by December.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-us-federal-reserve-expected-to-deliver-small-rate-hike-but-keep-anti/
36,Here's everything the Fed is expected to do Wednesday,2023-02-01T11:55:26Z,This week's Federal Reserve meeting will be remembered more for what policymakers say than what they do.,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference following the announcement that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2022. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters
This week's Federal Reserve meeting will be remembered more for what policymakers say than what they do. That's because markets have priced in a near-100% certainty — 98.9% to be exact, as of Tuesday afternoon — that the Federal Open Market Committee will announce a 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase when the two-day policy meeting wraps up Wednesday afternoon, according to CME Group data. While there's often strong market consensus heading into FOMC meetings, it's rarely this high. What markets are unsure of is where the Fed goes from here. Traders are betting the central bank will hike a quarter point once more in March then stop, pause for several months, and then start cutting toward the end of the year. Conscious that the fight against inflation is far from over, despite some encouraging data lately, Chairman Jerome Powell could push back on the idea of a looser Fed so soon in the future. Fed projections released in December indicate no cuts this year and continued rate hikes. ""He is on a very tight monetary policy tightrope, where he can't allow the market to think this is the endgame,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. ""It's prudent for him to be careful. It would be almost reckless for him to have the market believe that they're just about finished and inflation is where they want it. Inflation is certainly not where they want it."" With the careful communication path Powell must walk in mind, here's what to expect when the FOMC's post-meeting statement is released at 2 pm ET:
Rates
Over the past few weeks, Fed officials have been explicit in stating that, at the very least, they can start approving smaller moves than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases approved in 2022. That began in December with a 0.5-point move, and will continue with this highly anticipated move. That will take the fed funds rate to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007. The funds rate is what banks use as a benchmark for overnight borrowing, but it flows through to many consumer credit instruments like car loans, mortgages and credit cards. Though some Fed officials, such as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, have suggested the rate hike could be half a point, there's virtually no chance of that happening. A quarter point is a lock.
The statement
For the most part, the post-meeting statement has changed little except for a few notable tweaks. There is some speculation that the statement could get adjusted a bit more to add uncertainty of how much more aggressive the Fed wants to get. One key phrase that has been part of each statement since the hikes began in March 2022 is that committee members feel ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate."" That language could get softened, and it's likely the first place market participants will look for the Fed to tip its hand to acknowledge that the rate-hiking cycle is nearing an end.
watch now
There won't be any ""dot plot"" this meeting of individual members' rate expectations, nor will there be an update to the Summary of Economic Projections on GDP, unemployment and inflation. So any hints about the future policy path will have to come first from the statement. ""They'll likely do another 25 at the March meeting and that's when the cycle comes to end,"" Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a client note. ""We see incredibly limited scope for the Fed to plausibly justify keeping this cycle going deeper into the year with what will already be a very restrictive policy stance in the face of what are likely mounting economic challenges to the backdrop.""

38,What to expect from the Fed meeting,2023-02-01T11:34:55Z,The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time in 11 months at the conclusion of its first monetary policy meeting of 2023 on Wednesday.,"New York CNN —
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time in 11 months at the conclusion of its first monetary policy meeting of 2023 on Wednesday.
But the meeting could also mark a pivotal turning point for the central bank’s decision making: a return to normal.
The Fed is expected to slow the pace of rate hikes to a quarter percentage point, down from a half point in December. That would raise the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight borrowing to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. It would also return the central bank to a more traditional, gentler pace of increases after a turbulent period of historically large hikes that upended markets, households and the economy.
Now that inflation pressures have eased in recent months, consumer spending and hiring have slowed, and wage increases have moderated, many analysts believe the central bank could even stop raising rates — and possibly cut them later this year. Others say it’s premature to assume a rate hike pause is on the horizon.
Going the distance
The key question facing Fed watchers this meeting is how the central bank will signal the path forward for the rest of the year. Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has “a ways to go,” or will Fed officials signal that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?
Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning. Consumer confidence data indicates uncertainty about the future, and recession fears have risen, especially among CEOs.
That might sound like bad news, but it means that the Fed’s mission to cool the economy and stall price increases is working. In December, Powell outlined how he hopes to win his ongoing fight against inflation: Limit economic growth and rebalance the labor market, which he said would allow inflation to return to a growth rate of about 2%.
Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target. The Consumer Price Index shows that while inflation continued to cool in the most recent reading, annual price growth is still at a historically high 6.5%.
“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note.
Policymakers are unlikely to declare victory in their inflation fight just yet.
“This first meeting of the year will no doubt be a very interesting one as it will set the tone for the rest of year,” wrote EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a recent note. “But, rather than a slow waltz, we anticipate an infernal tango as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.”

Investors are becoming increasingly confident that major central banks will change course soon. They expect rates set by the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB to reach their peak by this spring. At that point, they’re expected to hold rates steady while they assess the impact on inflation.
One challenge, though, is that the full impact is unlikely to become apparent until next year.
Take the housing market, which is very sensitive to changes in interest rates and is closely monitored by central bankers. In the United Kingdom, more than 1.4 million households need to renew fixed-rate mortgages this year. Most had been set at interest rates below 2%.
When their mortgage costs rise, they could pull back spending. That could ease inflation, but also boost the risk of recession. (The United Kingdom is the only Group of Seven economy that the IMF predicts will shrink this year.)
Another major unknown is the job market. The Fed wants to cool hiring and wage increases, which can drive up inflationary pressures. It has acknowledged that “there’s going to be a bit of pain to achieve the inflation target,” seeing job losses as the “lesser of two evils,” Rossiter said.",https://edition.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-today-fed-2123

Demand for so-called cross-currency swaps rose last year after the U.S. central bank moved faster than monetary-policy makers abroad to lift rates and cool down the economy, according to investment bankers and advisers. Under a cross-currency swap, a company exchanges principal and interest payments on its debt into another currency. A key goal of the transaction is to swap into a currency with lower rates, allowing a company to reduce its interest costs.
Market dynamics, however, are shifting. The Fed, which is set to announce its next rate decision on Wednesday, has signaled that it plans to slow the pace of hikes amid signs inflation has begun to fall from four-decade highs. By contrast, central bankers in Europe have said they have more work to do to tamp down rising prices. The European Central Bank and Bank of England are scheduled on Thursday to announce their latest rate-hike decisions. The Bank of Japan in January kept short-term rates unchanged, despite pressure from investors.
Swaps can lose their appeal to companies when the gap between interest rates in two countries, or central banks, narrows. That has begun to happen, for instance, between the U.S. and the European Union. The estimated savings on a five-year swap of a U.S. bond with a 2% coupon into euros was 0.98 percentage point last month, according to Chatham Financial, a financial risk advisory firm. That is down from 1.34 percentage points in December and 1.93 percentage points in May, when the spread between the two was at its widest in 2022, according to Chatham.
Corporate advisers said they expect cross-currency swap volumes to decline in the months ahead, assuming market expectations for future rate increases hold steady. “I would expect to see, in general, less activity,” said Amol Dhargalkar, managing partner and chairman at Chatham Financial, noting that savings are declining and many companies already took advantage of the market.

Still, for companies that used cross-currency swaps in 2022, the savings reaped by keeping interest costs under control weren’t insignificant.
New York-based Tapestry Inc., which owns fashion brands including Coach and Kate Spade, expects to pay between $30 million and $35 million in net interest expenses during its 2023 fiscal year as a result of cross-currency swaps executed last year. During the prior fiscal year ended July 2, the company’s interest expenses totaled $58.7 million.
Tapestry in May essentially swapped out the entire value of its $1.2 billion U.S. bond portfolio so that it could take advantage of wide differentials in rates between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with about half going into euros and the other half into Japanese yen. Under the terms of the contracts, Tapestry makes semiannual interest payments of 2.4% and 2.7% in euros and 0.1% and minus 0.3% in Japanese yen. By comparison, the company’s most recent bond issuance in December 2021 carried a 3.05% coupon.
Tapestry considered issuing debt in Europe instead of doing a cross-currency swap, but decided against it given the company’s relatively small presence in the region and the need for a roadshow to educate investors, executives said. The company generates less than 5% of its total revenue in Europe, the company said. Tapestry has only issued debt in the U.S.

“Our name is not as well known in Europe given the relative size. So as an early entree [into the region], this makes a lot of sense,” Chief Financial and Operating Officer Scott Roe said, discussing the company’s decision to move forward with a swap.
For many U.S. companies, the combination of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates for much of last year created a lucrative scenario to enter into cross-currency swaps, said Bob Stark, global head of market strategy at Kyriba, a treasury management software provider.
Swaps can also provide finance chiefs at global companies more predictability in their cash flows by protecting them from currency volatility, Mr. Stark said. The value of the dollar last year strengthened against other currencies as a result of the Fed’s aggressive steps to tackle inflation.
Demand for cross-currency swaps, while elevated in 2022, has been robust since a hedge accounting rule was adopted in 2017 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, bankers and advisers said. That rule made it easier for companies to use cross-currency swaps and recognize the interest savings on their financial statements.

Companies don’t need to enter into swaps at the time they issue debt, but instead can opportunistically take advantage of interest-rate differentials when it makes sense for them to do so. “That was a huge part of the volume in 2022,” said Paula Comings, managing director and co-head of foreign exchange sales at U.S. Bancorp.
Mirion Technologies Inc., a provider of radiation measurement and detection systems, said in November it expects savings of roughly $2 million a year as a result of a cross-currency swap it entered into in October. The Atlanta-based company expects to spend $42 million on net interest costs in 2022, which includes some of the savings from its recently executed swap.
Under the terms of the company’s swap, Mirion exchanged a $115.6 million loan carrying a fixed rate of 7.66%, and in return received a €115.7 million loan carrying a fixed rate of 5.83%, according to a regulatory filing. The swap expires in March 2026.
The swap is aimed in part at helping the company reduce the effects of currency volatility on the company’s results, Chief Executive Thomas Logan said on a Nov. 1 earnings call. “Foreign exchange continues to be a headwind,” Mr. Logan said.
Third-quarter revenue rose 12%, to just over $160 million. Its net loss held steady at about $47 million. The company declined to comment beyond its latest quarterly results.

The broader all-share index also went up by 96 points, or 2.70 percent, to settle at 3,687.17, on a value turnover of P9 billion. Gainers outnumbered losers, 143 to 49, while 43 issues were unchanged.
All ten most active stocks ended in the green, led by PLDT Inc. which climbed 6.41 percent to P1,428.00 and International Container Terminal Services Inc. which gained 5.40 percent to P218.60.
Most Asian markets also traded higher Wednesday. The gains will provide some relief to investors after January’s rally appeared to have hit the buffers this week on lingering concerns about the economic outlook.

Expectations the Fed will hike borrowing costs by just 25 basis points on Wednesday were ramped up after a key gauge of wage increases came in below forecasts.
“The employment cost index is closely watched by the Fed as it compositionally adjusts wages growth, unlike other more timely measures,” said National Australia Bank’s Tapas Strickland.
“More important for the Fed is one of the subcomponents, the wages and salaries for private sector workers excluding incentive paid occupations, which rose 0.9 percent on-quarter from 1.2 previously.”
He added that the reading was “a notable deceleration and in quarter annualized terms would be equivalent to 3.6-3.7 percent. That is close to being consistent with at-target inflation if repeated next quarter.”
The ECI reading came as another report showed a slowdown in the US housing market as well as a dip in consumer confidence, suggesting the Fed’s tightening campaign is beginning to kick in.
While they indicate the world’s top economy is slowing, hope is building that the data will allow the central bank to wind down its rate hikes.
“We’re getting closer to the terminal rate,” Sassan Ghahramani, of SGH Macro Advisors, told Bloomberg Television. “Data that has come out does not justify 50-basis-point hikes. If anything, I’d say it’s virtually a 100 percent certainty they do 25.”
OANDA’s Edward Moya added: “Wall Street is slowly growing confident that this week’s Fed rate hike might end up being the last one in this tightening cycle.”
All three main indexes on Wall Street ended more than one percent higher, helped by strong earnings from big-ticket firms including ExxonMobil and General Motors.
And Asia picked up the baton, with Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei, Mumbai, Bangkok and Jakarta all in positive territory.
Mumbai managed to rally around 1.9 percent, despite more heavy selling of tycoon Gautam Adani’s business empire, which has now lost around a third—or $76 billion—of its value after allegations of massive accounting fraud from a US investment group.
Worst-hit was Adani Total Gas, which saw trading suspended again after another 10 percent drop, while flagship Adani Enterprises shed more than five percent. The losses came even after a stock sale in the firm Tuesday was oversubscribed.
London, Paris and Frankfurt all opened on the front foot.
With an eye on Wednesday’s post-meeting news conference at the Fed, SPI Asset Management’s Stephen Innes said: “The running assumption is that the Fed doesn’t want the market bossing them into a less hawkish policy corner, and in the Q&A, the pushback comes from Powell.
“But without doubt… reporters will try to coax out the word pause from Powell, and if there is any whiff of that word, risk assets will take flight.” With AFP

The 2-year Treasury yield was last trading at 4.1929% after falling by more than one basis point.
U.S. Treasury yields declined on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision and hoped for guidance about future monetary policy from Fed officials.
The Fed's first meeting of the year is expected to conclude later on Wednesday with a fresh interest rate policy announcement. Investors are broadly anticipating the central bank to hike rates by 25 basis points as its fight against persistent inflation continues.
That would be a further slowdown of the pace of rate hikes after the Fed implemented four consecutive 75 basis point increases, followed by a 50 basis point hike, at its last five meetings.
Investors are also hoping for hints about future interest rate policy, including whether the Fed could pause rate increases this year. Concerns about rates being hiked too high and too quickly and therefore leading to a recession have spread among investors in recent months.

45,Analysis: Hawkish Fed could hobble volatility funds’ stock buying spree,2023-02-01T07:36:57Z,"Volatility-linked funds estimated to be buying as much as $2 billion in U.S. equities daily are helping drive this year's rebound in stocks and may ramp up purchases in coming weeks, though a hawkish Federal Reserve could spoil the party.","NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Volatility-linked funds estimated to be buying as much as $2 billion in U.S. equities daily are helping drive this year's rebound in stocks and may ramp up purchases in coming weeks, though a hawkish Federal Reserve could spoil the party.
The S&P 500’s (.SPX) 6.2% surge in January has been accompanied by a drop in measures of volatility across the board. Daily swings in the index over the past month were the smallest since early 2022, while the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX) also stands near a one-year low.
The drop in market gyrations has triggered a buy-signal for certain computer-driven strategies including volatility control funds, risk parity funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs).
Reuters Graphics
Broadly known as systematic strategies, these funds have been scooping up between $1 billion and $2 billion a day in U.S. stocks, according to BNP Paribas estimates, helping drive an equity rally that has come despite worries that a hawkish Fed will plunge the U.S. economy into recession.
""This has definitely been more a flow-driven rally than a shift in the overall fundamental backdrop,"" said Max Grinacoff, U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas.
Grinacoff estimates these types of funds could deploy another $50 billion-$60 billion of additional buying over the course of a month if realized volatility - a measure of daily stock swings - halves from its current level of around 16%, a level of calm unseen in U.S. stocks since late 2021.
Of course, the market will have to navigate a plethora of risks ahead - most prominently the Fed, which concludes its monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Signs that the central bank is unlikely to pull back on its hawkish monetary policy outlook despite evidence of slowing inflation and softness in the economy could exacerbate recession fears and reignite volatility, forcing the funds to taper purchases or even start selling.
Markets widely expect the central bank to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points to between 4.50% and 4.75%.
Other potential pitfalls include earnings from some of the largest U.S. companies this week, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), as well as the closely watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
""As we think that technical factors may have played a large role in the market performance so far this year, we expect this to eventually wane as fundamental factors resume the dominant position as market drivers,"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note on Tuesday.
FAVORABLE CONDITIONS
Investors said conditions were supportive of a rally at the beginning of the year. The S&P 500's 19.4% drop last year, its worst annual percentage decline since 2008, had prompted market participants - including various volatility-linked strategies - to cut their equity allocations to historically low levels.
""We have this trifecta of seemingly depressed equity positioning across three major investor groups: vol target funds, CTAs and hedge funds,"" said Anand Omprakash, head of derivatives quantitative strategy at Elevation Securities.
Volatility control funds have raised their equity allocation to a nine-month high of 57.7%, strategists at Deutsche Bank wrote on Friday.
Grinacoff, of BNP Paribas, estimates volatility control funds have assets of about $275 billion, while CTAs, not all of which have a volatility control strategy, as a group have $800 billion allocated across strategies.
While that is modest relative to the roughly $34 trillion value of the S&P 500 alone, such funds bear watching since they buy in rising markets and sell when stocks tumble, and can potentially exacerbate downside moves as well as rallies.
To be sure, while volatility has fallen from last year’s peaks, when the VIX rose as high as 36.55, current levels remain above the index’s long-term average, a sign that options investors are likely mindful of the risks ahead, said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics.
""Market volatility measured by VIX remains stuck above the 18 level, which is its long-term average. This indicates a slight anxiety regarding macro outcomes on future volatility,"" he said.

But don’t mistake the central bank’s downshift for a dovish pivot.
With a 25-basis-point interest-rate hike all but locked in (a basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point), the biggest news on Wednesday will come not from the Fed’s policy moves but the statement and press conference that will follow its two-day policy meeting.

47,Smaller rate increase expected from Federal Reserve,2023-02-01T05:42:00Z,"The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in about 15 years.","The Fed is expected to raise the benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in about 15 years.
WASHINGTON — Inflation is cooling, and parts of the economy appear to be weakening. But Chair Jerome Powell is likely Wednesday to underscore that the Federal Reserve's primary focus remains the need to fight surging prices with still-higher interest rates.
With financial markets anticipating that the Fed will stop raising rates soon and possibly even cut them later this year, analysts say Powell will need to push back against such optimism. If financial markets expect lower rates than what the Fed plans to deliver, the central bank's already treacherous task can become even harder.
Powell's tough message will likely emerge at a news conference after the Fed's 19-member policy committee announces its latest action. The policymakers are set to raise their benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in about 15 years. The move could further increase borrowing rates for consumers as well as companies, ranging from mortgages to auto and business loans.
In some ways, the Fed's challenge is trickier than it was last year, when inflation accelerated much faster than officials had expected. After being caught off guard — Powell had initially characterized high inflation as only a temporary phenomenon — officials developed a clear view of what was needed: An aggressive series of rate hikes to slow borrowing and spending, cool growth and curb high inflation.
Now, though, inflation has weakened since the fall. As a result, the risks that the Fed’s rate hikes could send the economy into a painful recession, with waves of job losses, are rising. Consumer prices, by the Fed's preferred measure, have risen at just a 2.9% annual rate in the past three months. Yet Fed officials have said they would need to see further evidence that inflation was declining closer to its 2% target before they would consider suspending their rate hikes.
The latest sign that inflation is cooling came Tuesday in a report that showed wage growth slowed in the final three months of last year for a third straight quarter. That report could reassure Fed officials that rising paychecks are now less likely to fuel inflation.
Over the past year, with businesses offering healthy raises to try to attract and keep enough workers, Powell has expressed concern that hefty pay growth in the labor-intensive service sector would keep inflation too high. Businesses typically pass their increased labor costs on to their customers by charging higher prices, thereby perpetuating inflation pressures.
Some economists think the Fed doesn't need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession. Economists at Morgan Stanley suggest that as inflation continues to ease in the coming months, Wednesday's rate hike will end up being the last one this year.
The Fed could signal that a pause in rate hikes is on the horizon by changing some language in the statement it issues after each policy meeting.
Since March, the statement has said that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” Some economists expect officials to slightly alter that part of the statement to make it a less specific commitment and give the Fed more flexibility.
Still, Powell isn't likely to signal that a pause in rate increases will occur anytime soon, out of concern that such a message could touch off rallies in stocks and bonds. Those trends could boost the economy — and inflation — by giving consumers more money to spend and encouraging people and businesses to borrow more. That's just the opposite of what the Fed wants.
“He's got to put a hawkish tint to everything he says,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon and a former top Fed staffer. (In Fed parlance, ""hawks"" typically favor higher rates to control inflation, while “doves” often lean toward lower rates to support employment.)
“Everybody is basically saying, ‘Hey, Chair Powell, let’s do your victory lap,' ''Reinhart said. “And he's like, 'We're only where we are because of our vigilance, and we can't let it down now.' ”
Financial markets have strengthened in anticipation of lower rates ahead. In December, Fed officials had forecast that they would raise their key rate above 5%. Investors, though, expect them to stop at a range of 4.75% to 5% and to end up cutting rates before the year is out. That's true even though Powell has gone out of his way to stress that the Fed doesn't expect to cut rates this year.
The divide between the Fed and financial markets is important because rate hikes need to work through markets to affect the economy. The Fed directly controls its key short-term rate. But it has only indirect control over the borrowing rates that people and businesses actually pay — for mortgages, corporate bonds, auto loans and many others.
The consequences can be seen in housing. The average fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage soared after the Fed first began hiking rates. Eventually, it topped 7%, more than twice where it had stood before the hiking began.
Yet since the fall, the average mortgage rate has eased to 6.13%, the lowest level since September. And while home sales fell further in December, a measure of signed contracts to buy homes actually rose. That suggested that lower rates might be luring some home buyers back to the market.",https://www.wltx.com/article/news/nation-world/federal-reserve-inflation-fight-far-from-over/507-2ce240a1-d152-454e-a833-dd68d4a2e547

So why do they do it? Well, they might bat a foul ball and force another pitch. They might even get a hit. But speaking from experience — drawn from my less than illustrious middle school baseball career — the reason we swing boils down to a simple truth: It feels better to go out swinging than to be standing embarrassingly still when the umpire calls the last strike. At least I tried, I used to tell myself.
In baseball, batters have to make a nerve-wracking decision when the count is full. One more ball gets them a free walk to first base; another strike and they’re out. Should they swing if the pitch isn’t in their sweet spot or should they hold steady and hope the umpire calls a ball?

Faced with a similar, albeit far more consequential, dilemma of deciding between action and inaction, the Federal Reserve has proved itself to be a steadfast fan of my middle school batting strategy. No matter how limited the tools at its disposal, the last thing the Fed seems to ever want is to appear like it’s doing nothing on inflation. Since prices began soaring last year, the Fed has opted to swing, aggressively raising interest rates despite the fact that there’s nothing close to a guarantee that doing so would be best for the economy.
Even as inflation has eased for six straight months, the Fed is committed to showing markets that it takes action, announcing yet another interest rate hike on Wednesday. Though it’s less aggressive than previous ones — a quarter of a percentage point increase compared with the three-quarter point peaks of last year — the Fed indicated that there will be more hikes to come. But it’s not clear why the Fed believes that hitting the brakes, even if more softly, is still necessary, especially given that it will take time to see the full effects of its previous hikes. That’s why what’s probably driving the central bank’s decision-making is not some precise calculation based on rigorous data analysis but the mere desire to have observers believe that it’s doing something rather than nothing.

But while that strategy worked for me whenever I was at bat — even if my team lost because I struck out, I’d still join my teammates on a much-anticipated fast food trip after the game with my dignity intact — it doesn’t necessarily work for the Fed. To the contrary, striking out in this case could mean a serious recession.
The Fed is hoping its interest rate hikes will create more unemployment, which would further ease inflation by reducing people’s spending. Not only is that a risky strategy — unemployment could quickly spiral out of control — but it’s also expressly antithetical to one of the Fed’s two main objectives.
In the 1970s, Congress enacted what is now known as the Fed’s dual mandate to pursue both price stability and full employment. But the truth is the Fed has never taken the employment part of its mandate all that seriously. Whenever inflation has reared its head, the Fed has thrown its pursuit of full employment out the window.

Shortly after the dual mandate became law, for example, the Fed responded to high inflation by sharply raising interest rates and triggering a recession to show markets that it would never tolerate price instability. Today, Fed chair Jerome Powell wants to display the same resolve, full employment be damned. He’s out there swinging to show markets that he won’t stand still while prices continue to rise, even though his tools to fight inflation have been especially blunt this cycle — incapable of addressing major inflationary pressures like energy costs or supply-chain bottlenecks.
All Powell can really do now is hurt the labor market. But by ignoring its goal of achieving full employment, the Fed is making lower-wage workers carry the burden of taming inflation by putting them out of work or erasing the significant wage gains they’ve made in the past decade, some of which had actually kept up with inflation before the Fed’s intervention.
That’s why the Fed would be wise to take a page out of the Houston Astros’s playbook, which encourages batters facing a full count to hold back from swinging at an iffy pitch. The odds of getting a walk in that situation are higher than getting a hit. Still, anxiety and the pressure to do something eat away at even some of the most well-trained athletes. Just ask the Astros’s Michael Brantley, who, facing a full count with two outs in the bottom of the ninth of Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, struck out swinging on a slider, handing the Washington Nationals its first championship win in franchise history.

US stocks slipped Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, which is expected to mark the eighth consecutive increase since last March.
Markets are broadly anticipating policymakers to announce a 25-basis-point hike at 2:00 p.m. ET, representing a further step down in the pace of tightening. In December, the Fed raised rates by 50 basis points after four straight hikes of 75 basis points.

53,The federal government is cracking down on the crypto industry,2023-02-01T05:00:00Z,Recent actions by the White House and Federal Reserve reflect a harsher stance toward the turbulent sector.,"Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers insider insight on policy and regulation.
The crypto industry started the year with some wins under its belt, from Republican allies taking over key House committees to a surprising rally in the price of Bitcoin. It’s also been an entire 12 days since a major company declared bankruptcy, which we’ll file under the positive development category.
That streak ended last Friday with two (apparently) unrelated governmental actions: The White House released a “roadmap” to mitigating risks posed by crypto, and the Federal Reserve denied the membership application for Custodia, a digital assets bank.
While both moves may seem like administrative paper-pushing, they reflect a harsher stance from the federal government toward crypto—an outcome that should have been expected given the wreckage left behind by the industry over the past months.
The Custodia decision sends a signal that the Federal Reserve is not giving companies any points for playing by the rules. Led by industry veteran Caitlin Long, Custodia has gone through the proper channels of becoming a “special purpose depository institution” in Wyoming, which, among other stipulations, means that it can’t lend money and has to hold liquid backing for all its deposits.
The crypto industry is currently undergoing a banking crisis as players like Silvergate and Signature hemorrhage money. In an interview with Fortune, Long argued that Custodia’s unique structure would offer stability and prevent bank runs—something not guaranteed by the currently available options. With crypto companies increasingly finding backdoors into traditional finance, such as with Alameda Research’s investment in Moonstone née Farmington State Bank, she said that regulators are lucky the FTX implosion happened as early as it did.
“It’s important to have a safe and sound connection between the traditional financial system and the digital asset financial system,” she told Fortune.
In Friday’s release, White House officials made clear they believe the two can remain separated, writing that any new legislation from Congress should not allow mainstream institutions—like pension funds or, presumably, the banking system—to “dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets.”
For those keeping count at home, the Federal Reserve and White House ostensibly operate independently from each other. That the two intertwined actions came on the same day should raise at least a few eyebrows.
Custodia has raised such concerns about inter-governmental coordination in the past. The bank still has a lawsuit pending against the Kansas City Federal Reserve for a different application to operate with a “master account,” which would allow it access to Fed payment services, including money transfers between banks. Custodia has blamed the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., for slow-rolling the application behind the scenes—an accusation that the judge overseeing the case described as plausible in November.
The relationship between the White House and the Federal Reserve could grow even closer, as top Biden advisor Brian Deese—who helped pen Friday’s crypto roadmap—prepares to vacate his position at the National Economic Council.
Rumored to be a front-runner? One of the most outspoken voices at the Federal Reserve on crypto’s threat to traditional finance, Vice Chair Lael Brainard.
The setback for Custodia is likely a sign of austere times to come for the crypto industry.

54,Federal Reserve raises its key rate for 8th time,2023-02-01T05:00:00Z,"The central bank’s latest move put its benchmark short-term rate in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in about 15 years.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve extended its fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point, its eighth hike since March. And the Fed signaled that even though inflation is easing, it remains high enough to require further rate hikes.
At the same time, Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has cooled — a signal that it could be nearing the end of its rate increases. The stock and bond markets rallied during his news conference, suggesting that they anticipate a forthcoming pause in the Fed’s credit tightening.
Throughout his remarks Wednesday, Powell sounded a dual message. He frequently acknowledged signs that high inflation is slowing.
“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession.
In a statement, Fed officials repeated language they’ve used before, that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” That is widely interpreted to mean they will raise their benchmark rate again when they next meet in March and perhaps in May as well.
The Fed chair said that so far, much of the inflation slowdown reflects the prices of goods, notably gas but also furniture, appliances and other finished products that have benefited from an unraveling of supply chain snarls.
But Powell reiterated his concern that prices for services — restaurant meals, health care, airline tickets and the like — are still surging. He has said he pays particular attention to services prices because they are labor-intensive. As a result, robust wage gains can keep services prices elevated and perpetuate high inflation.
The central bank’s benchmark rate is now in a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years. Powell appeared to suggest Wednesday that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes:
“We’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive,” he said, referring to rates high enough to slow the economy.
Yet Wall Street investors have priced in only one more hike. Collectively, in fact, they expect the Fed to reverse course and actually cut rates by the end of this year. That optimism has helped drive stock prices up and bond yields down, easing credit and pushing in the opposite direction that the Fed would prefer.
Last summer, Powell took the opportunity in a high-profile speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to push back against market expectations of rate cuts anytime soon. His speech hammered home the Fed’s intent to keep raising rates — even if it caused “pain” in the form of slower growth and higher unemployment.
On Wednesday, though, Powell declined an opportunity to defuse the market’s buoyant expectations.
“Our focus,” he said, “is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes” in financial markets.
He noted instead that many financial gauges, like mortgage rates, are much higher than they were when the Fed began raising rates.
The divide between the central bank and financial markets is important because rate hikes need to work through markets to affect the economy. The Fed directly controls its key short-term rate. But it has only indirect control over borrowing rates that people and businesses actually pay — for mortgages, corporate bonds, auto loans and many others.
The consequences can be seen in housing. The average fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage soared after the Fed first began hiking rates. Eventually, it topped 7%, more than twice where it had stood before the hiking began.
Yet since the fall, the average mortgage rate has eased to 6.13%, the lowest level since September. And while home sales fell further in December, a measure of signed contracts to buy homes actually rose. That suggested that lower rates might be drawing some home buyers back to the market.
On Wednesday, Powell brushed aside any concern that the Fed will end up tightening credit too much and trigger a recession.
“I still think there is a path to getting inflation down to 2%,” the Fed’s target level, “without a significant economic decline or significant increase in unemployment,” he said.
The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal. But inflation is still far above the central bank’s 2% target. The risk is that with some sectors of the economy weakening, ever-higher borrowing costs could tip the economy into a downturn later this year.
Retail sales, for example, have fallen for two straight months, suggesting that consumers are becoming more cautious about spending. Manufacturing output has fallen for two months. On the other hand, the nation’s job market – the most important pillar of the economy – remains strong, with the unemployment rate at a 53-year low at 3.5%.
The Fed’s hike was announced a day after the government said pay and benefits for America’s workers grew more slowly in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown. Powell said the report was encouraging but reflected wage growth that was still too fast.
While higher pay is good for workers, businesses typically pass their increased labor costs on to their customers by charging higher prices, thereby perpetuating inflation pressures.
In December, overall inflation eased to 6.5% in December from a year earlier, down from a four-decade peak of 9.1% in June. The decline has been driven in part by cheaper gas, which has tumbled to $3.50 a gallon, on average, nationwide, from $5 in June.
In addition to the Fed, other major central banks are fighting high inflation with their own rate hikes. The European Central Bank is expected to raise its benchmark rate by a half-point when it meets Thursday. Inflation in Europe, though slowing, remains high, at 8.5% in January compared with a year earlier.
The Bank of England is forecast to lift its rate at a meeting Thursday as well. Inflation has reached 10.5% in the United Kingdom. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the U.K. economy will likely enter recession this year.

55,Everything to Know About February's Meeting,2023-02-01T05:00:00Z,Insider's Phil Rosen speaks to experts about how the Federal Reserve's rate hike could impact stocks and market volatility.,"Happy hump day, readers. I'm senior reporter Phil Rosen.
If the collapse of FTX has been the headline story over the last several months, it certainly feels like ChatGPT has taken the mantle for the near future.
The bot's parent company took in $10 billion from Microsoft a couple of weeks ago, and the language tool has proven it can do just about everything except your dishes and laundry.
Oh — and it also can't quite balance a portfolio.
Remember Watson? That was the last bot that seemed to alter the fabric of society — it even won Jeopardy!
As it turns out, Watson has more than just game shows in his (its?) wheelhouse. While ChatGPT wows us with its text capabilities, the IBM supercomputer has quietly powered an ETF that's doubled the returns of the broader market.
I'm serious.
But enough about bots. We can't stop them.
Let's break down what to know ahead of the Federal Reserve's widely expected interest rate hike today.

1. Today's rate hike decision probably won't surprise anyone, as markets have long priced in a 25-basis-point move for the February and March meetings.
If all goes as planned, this will mark the eighth consecutive rate hike since March last year, which falls in line with what the Fed warned in December:
""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.""
That means more rate hikes are on the way.
But markets have yet to act as if that were the case — stocks have enjoyed their best January since 2019.
All eyes will be on Jerome Powell as he steps up to the podium today. To Michael Reinking, the New York Stock Exchange's senior market strategist, the chairman will likely try to temper market enthusiasm with another hawkish message.
""[Powell's] message will likely continue to focus on the duration of time rates will stay at a restrictive stance,"" Reinking said. ""How he couches where we are in achieving that restrictive stance will be closely watched.""
Just like before December's meeting, stocks have rallied leading up to the decision. Reinking pointed out that markets are just about desensitized to hawkish commentary.
Gene Goldman, the chief investment officer for Cetera Investment Management, told me on a call yesterday that rate hikes can take 12 to 15 months to have an impact on the economy, which means repercussions from last year's first tightening efforts are only now beginning to emerge.
Goldman said he'll be watching for three things in Powell's speech:
Powell will talk tough: ""He's going to push back on financial markets. The dot plot says rates will be between 5% to 5.25% by the end of this year, but markets are pricing in 4.5%.""
""He's going to push back on financial markets. The dot plot says rates will be between 5% to 5.25% by the end of this year, but markets are pricing in 4.5%."" More rate hikes are coming: ""Powell might acknowledge that the economy is slowing down and inflation is easing, but he's also going to signal the Fed's job is not over.""
""Powell might acknowledge that the economy is slowing down and inflation is easing, but he's also going to signal the Fed's job is not over."" This time could be different: ""It's possible Powell signals that we won't need to push the economy into a recession. The labor market and housing market are different than they were in 2008, so maybe there's a different path forward here.""
In any case, according to Reinking, unless Powell musters up some serious aggression, any messaging will ultimately fall upon deaf ears.
""[That] could add to the squeeze that has been ongoing since the start of the year,"" he explained. ""If this happens, the real test will be holding above the December highs.""

All eyes on 1900 GMT Fed announcement
SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Asia's stockmarkets steadied on Wednesday, with signs of a slowdown in U.S. wages bolstering hopes that the Federal Reserve could hint at an end to interest rate hikes at its meeting later in the day.
Wall Street indexes had rallied, as had bonds to a lesser extent, while the dollar gave up gains overnight when the Fed's preferred wages gauge, the U.S. employment cost index, showed a 1% rise last quarter, its smallest increase in a year.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.6% in early trade, following a 1.2% drop on Tuesday, while Japan's Nikkei (.N225) rose 0.7%.
The Fed will announce its rate decision at 1900 GMT, followed by a news conference with Chair Jerome Powell half an hour later.
Interest-rate markets have priced in a slowdown in the cracking pace of rate hikes, with a 25 basis point hike seen bringing the Fed funds rate target range to 4.5-4.75%.
Barring surprises, the focus will be on Powell's tone. The market is trying to gauge whether he foreshadows an endpoint for hikes in the near future, as well as whether he pushes back on market pricing for rate cuts beginning as soon as the second half of this year.
""The market is anticipating some pushback from Powell, although it's difficult to pin down how much is enough to convince the market,"" said Brian Daingerfield, head of G10 currency strategy at NatWest Markets.
""Anything short of Powell going 10 for 10 hawkish may ultimately be seen as being not hawkish enough. Conversely, the market may take even the smallest dovish concession and run with it.""
Currency trade has been in a holding pattern ahead of the Fed and Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings that follow on Thursday. But the U.S. wages data wiped out some small dollar gains made earlier this week amid some nerves that the Fed sticks to its hawkish stance.
The dollar dropped for a fourth straight month in January, and lost 1.5% on the euro and 0.8% on the yen . Both pairs were steady in early Asia trade, with the euro at $1.0860 and the dollar buying 129.91 yen.
The Australian dollar , which gained 3.5% through January, took a breather at $0.7052.
U.S. treasuries were cautiously firmer in Asia, with benchmark 10-year yields down 2 bps to 3.5105%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%.
EARNINGS, ECONOMICS
Solid earnings also lifted Wall Street and the mood overnight, even as company executives struck a cautious tone as many firms brace for an expected economic slowdown.
Exxon (XOM.N) posted a record $59 billion adjusted profit. United Parcel Service (UPS.N), the world's biggest package delivery firm, beat forecasts and shares rose 4.7%.
Caterpillar (CAT.N) and McDonald's (MCD.N) shares fell as the companies warned of inflation squeezing profit margins.
Macroeconomic data was less encouraging. Japan's factory activity contracted for a third straight month in January, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
South Korea posted a record monthly trade deficit for January due mainly to a far worse-than-expected drop in exports. Unemployment rose in New Zealand, though only a little bit and from record lows.
In commodity markets, optimism for demand supported oil prices and Brent crude futures were up 0.23% to $85.67 a barrel. Gold , which rallied on the dollar's weakness through January, paused at $1,927 an ounce.
Indian conglomerate Adani, meanwhile, completed a $2.5 billion share sale on Tuesday as it fends off an attack from a U.S. short seller. Adani Enterprises (ADEL.NS) stock closed below the lower end of the stock issue price on Tuesday.
Prices for dollar bonds in Adani Group companies were steadying in Asia trade on Wednesday after last week's rout.

Wage growth slows as Fed set to ease up rate hikes
Wages and benefits rose at a slower rate during the final three months of 2022, according to data released Tuesday, giving the Federal Reserve room to ease up its fight against inflation.
The Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index (ECI), which tracks increases in wage and benefits costs for employers, rose 1 percent for non-military employees during the fourth quarter, slightly lower than economists expected. It was the smallest gain in the ECI since the fourth quarter of 2021.
Why it matters: The Fed pays close attention to the index as a sign of how much a strong labor market is driving inflation. The year-end slowdown in wage and compensation growth could give the Fed more confidence to keep slowing down — and eventually stop — its series of aggressive rate hikes.
“A downshift in ECI wage growth in Q4 would not immediately stop Fed officials talking about their intention to raise rates further. But their tone likely will soften, and such data would make it more difficult for them to continue hiking after this week,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a Tuesday analysis.

A pandemic watchdog group identified nearly 70,000 “questionable” Social Security numbers that were used to obtain $5.4 billion in pandemic-related federal loans.
The group, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, issued the report on Monday analyzing information from more than 33 million applications from the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans and the Paycheck Protection Program.
The group found that more than 221,000 Social Security numbers used on applications were “not issued” by the federal government, or did not match the applicants’ name or date of birth.
The federal government awarded nearly 70,000 of the 221,000 Social Security numbers flagged for potential identity fraud a loan or a grant.

BUDGET BATTLES
White House to release budget proposal on March 9
The White House will release its budget proposal for next fiscal year on March 9, officials said Tuesday, as they pressure Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to release a detailed budget of his own outlining House Republicans’ spending plans.
The White House on Tuesday circulated a memo from National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young ahead of President Biden’s meeting with McCarthy on the debt ceiling. The two officials confirmed Biden would unveil his budget for fiscal 2024 in early March.
White House officials are using the release of the budget to lean on McCarthy to be transparent about whether he wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare as members of his caucus call for spending cuts.
Biden and McCarthy will meet Wednesday at the White House to discuss the debt ceiling, which lawmakers must raise in the coming months or risk a government default that could wreck the economy. Some Republicans have signaled they plan to use the debt ceiling negotiations as leverage to secure spending cuts and reforms to government programs.

UNEQUAL TREATMENT
Black taxpayers more than three times more likely to be audited by IRS
A new report found that the IRS audits Black taxpayers at a significantly higher rate than non-Black taxpayers.
The paper, published by Stanford’s Institute for Economic Policy Research, said that despite the IRS’s “race-blind audit selection,” Black taxpayers are audited 2.9 to 4.7 times more often than non-Black taxpayers.
The research did not suggest that the disparity is a result of one group of people evading taxes more than another but rather that it may be a result of the computer algorithms the IRS uses for selection.
The study found that the largest disparity between the groups was among those claiming the earned income tax credit, which helps low- to moderate-income workers and families get a tax break, according to the IRS.
