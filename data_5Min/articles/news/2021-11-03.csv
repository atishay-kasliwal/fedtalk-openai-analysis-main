 Nov 3 (Reuters) - Gold prices slid to their weakest level since mid-October on Wednesday, as investors feared the Federal Reserve might signal a faster-than-expected tapering of its pandemic-era stimulus measures at the end of its policy meeting."
2,"Spot gold was down 1.5% at $1,760.99 per ounce by 11:22 a.m. EDT (1522 GMT), after touching its lowest since Oct. 13 at $1,757.63 earlier."
3,"U.S. gold futures fell 1.6% to $1,761.60."
4,The Fed is expected to announce the tapering of its $120 billion-a-month asset purchase program in its policy statement at 1800 GMT.
5,"“We may be seeing some pre-FOMC positioning, the fear being that policymakers will be more hawkish than markets anticipate,” OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said."
6,"Another bearish signal for gold was data showing U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in October, suggesting the labor market and overall economy were regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter."
7,"Upbeat payrolls data could mean a better-than-expected jobs report on Friday, and that could lend weight to the case for a faster hike in interest rates, said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures."
8,"“While interest rate policy is probably number one in everybody’s minds, a very, very close second are the inflationary pressures that we have in the market at the moment,” said Meger."
9,"Ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy has helped drive gold sharply higher since the financial crisis of the late 2000s, with low interest rates cutting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inflation fears stoking demand for a hedge."
10,Market participants are also eyeing a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday after recent data bolstered chances for a rate hike.
11,"Silver tumbled 1.7% to $23.12 per ounce, platinum fell 1.6% to $1,024.36 and palladium declined 0.9% to $1,992.36."
12,"Australian futures, as well as US equities, were steady as investors wait for confirmation that the US central bank will detail its taper plan."
13,"“If the Fed wants to ensure a hawkish signal it would drop its characterisation of inflation as transitory and/or accelerate the tapering to finish before mid-2022,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex."
14,Oil fell as major crude consumers intensified pressure on OPEC+ to boost supplies when it meets this week and after a report showed American oil inventories are at the highest since August.

63,It also makes the Fed the latest monetary authority to begin winding back the measures put in place at the start of the pandemic which have been crucial to the global rebound and an 18-month equity rally to multi-year or record highs.Policymakers had said at the outset that they would only start tapering when they were satisfied the world’s number one economy was well on the recovery track with unemployment under control and inflation running hot for an extended period.
64,"Inflation has been surging for months, while jobs creation continues to scorch along, albeit with the rare blip—reinforced by data Wednesday showing private businesses hired far more people than expected in October."
65,"However, while bank boss Jerome Powell was pleased with the economic recovery, he said he wanted to see the labor market heal more before hiking interest rates from record lows, telling reporters: “We think we can be patient.” The expectation is still for borrowing costs to rise in the middle of next year, soon after the bond-buying has come to an end."
66,“I don’t think we are behind the curve.
67,"I believe policy is well-positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes,” Powell said."

 The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policy-makers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it
 The U.S. Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on Aug. 22, 2018.Chris Wattie/Reuters
 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to detail plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases by mid-2022 as policy-makers shift their focus towards what, if anything, to do about a surge in inflation that is lasting longer than anticipated."
164,"U.S. central bankers, in the minutes of their Sept. 21-22 meeting, signalled that a “taper” of the $120-billion in monthly asset purchases would be approved at this week’s gathering of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee."
165,"What the minutes described as an “illustrative tapering path” would trim the purchases by $15-billion per month beginning in November or December, a pace and starting point that would end the program by June or July."
166,"Of more note now is how the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement, and particularly its description of inflation as “largely reflecting transitory factors.”
 Fed officials still largely hold that view."
167,"By some time in 2022 they anticipate that global supply bottlenecks will have eased, pandemic-fueled demand for goods among U.S. consumers will cool after massive spending on cars, motorcycles and appliances, and enough people will be pushing to return to jobs that the pace of wage and benefit increases will also subside."
168,But in recent weeks Fed officials have acknowledged the risks to that outlook.
169,"The jump in inflation this year has already lasted longer than anticipated; headline rates are running at twice the Fed’s 2 per cent target; and rising rents, low business inventories, and large numbers of workers still waiting on the sidelines may mean the high pace of price increases will continue for now."
170,The dilemma facing the U.S. central bank is whether inflation eases before policy-makers feel compelled to step in with interest rate increases to curb it.
171,Investors are acting as if the Fed’s patience will run out soon.

181,The White House has yet to announce whether the former investment banker will be reappointed to a second term.

183,"The Fed currently says it will not raise rates until inflation has not just risen to its 2 per cent target, but is on track to exceed it “for some time,” so that the 2 per cent level is maintained on average following years in which it ran low."

 Of more note now is whether the Fed changes other parts of its policy statement to take more account of inflation risks, and particularly whether it alters the description of inflation as “largely reflecting transitory factors.”

275,"To restore public confidence, the Federal Reserve must move promptly to require all top Fed officials to hold their financial assets in qualified blind trusts throughout their tenure in office."
276,The Federal Reserve’s reputation has been severely damaged by revelations that top Fed officials routinely ignored their own code of ethical conduct and that some officials may have broken the law.
277,"While the Fed has taken some positive steps in recent weeks, this scandal is still far from being resolved."
278,The Fed’s newly-announced ethics rules remain grossly inadequate.
279,Fed Chair Jerome Powell has not provided sufficient clarity about his own financial transactions.
280,And the Fed is still not following its own rules about engaging law enforcement agencies whenever criminal statutes may have been broken.
281,"Every federal official is strictly prohibited from using nonpublic information for personal gain, but this statute has distinctive implications for Federal Reserve officials."
282,"In particular, the Fed’s monetary policy actions have broad effects on financial markets, not just individual companies."
283,"ADVERTISEMENT
 Moreover, the Fed’s leadership often formulates its policy plans over an extensive horizon, and key aspects of those plans may remain confidential for many months."
284,"For example, in one previous Fed scandal, a Wall Street analyst sent a newsletter to clients in early October 2012 entitled “December Bound” that disclosed the Fed leadership’s plans for the December 2012 monetary policy meeting even though those plans hadn’t yet been discussed with the full committee, much less the general public."
285,"Thus, while prohibitions on owning stocks of specific companies may be a sensible restriction for many other public agencies, such rules are practically irrelevant for Federal Reserve officials, who could easily garner profits by investing in broad market indexes."
286,"Furthermore, a 45-day waiting period is simply too short to ensure that Fed officials do not profit from nonpublic information."
287,"To restore public confidence, the Federal Reserve must move promptly to require all top Fed officials to hold their financial assets in qualified blind trusts throughout their tenure in office."
288,"As the sole executive officer on the Fed’s Board of Governors, the chair has a unique role in determining its agenda, executing its policies and serving as role model for other Fed officials and staff."
289,"Unfortunately, Chair Powell’s financial disclosure forms over the past several years have been far more opaque and troubling than those of any other current member of the Fed’s Board of Governors."
290,"For example, Powell’s disclosure form for calendar year 2019 refers to very large quantities of securities transactions – both purchases and sales -- using the notation ""Multiple"" rather than disclosing the specific date of each transaction."
291,No other current Fed Board member has used that notation on any of their financial disclosure forms.
292,"In fact, the only president of a regional Federal Reserve Bank who followed such a practice was Robert Kaplan, who recently resigned from his position as president of the Dallas Fed."
293,Powell’s financial disclosures are also opaque about his personal role in managing the Powell Family Trusts.
294,"Given that those funds are not qualified blind trusts, it is troubling that large transactions were made around the time of monetary policy meetings, even though such transactions were strictly prohibited by the Fed's Code of Conduct."
295,The reputational damage of this scandal has been magnified by the Fed’s failure to follow its own policy in responding to recent revelations.
296,"In particular, the Fed must promptly request law enforcement agencies to join the Fed’s inspector general in investigating whether any laws were broken."
297,The involvement of law enforcement agencies is crucial to avoid potential conflicts of interest in carrying out this investigation.
298,"After all, the Federal Reserve’s inspector general is merely an employee who reports directly to the Fed’s chair and who can be terminated by a vote of the Fed’s board."
299,"Thus, a credible and swift investigation requires active cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice."
300,"Indeed, the Federal Reserve should welcome non-partisan congressional legislation to strengthen public confidence in the Fed’s ethics and integrity."
301,"The Fed’s inspector general should become a fully independent official, appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, just like at all other major federal agencies."
302,"In combination with the actions noted above, this measure will help restore the Fed’s reputation and bolster its effectiveness in carrying out its crucial mission as America’s central bank."

 The Federal Reserve describes higher inflation as fleeting, but economists expect it to stick around into 2022."
335,"The Federal Reserve has stuck to its characterization of this year's higher inflation as a ""transitory"" issue."
336,"But after six months of higher prices touching everything from food to energy prices, some economists say the phenomenon appears to be sticking around — and could last well into 2022."
337,"""I think probably another word is needed,"" noted Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics."
338,"Although, she added wryly, ""transitory"" could simply mean ""it won't persist in perpetuity."""
339,"Such price hikes are sending shocks through household budgets, following almost a decade when inflation rose between 1% to 2% annually."
340,"But in 2021, inflation is forecast to stand close to 5%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis."
341,"That's souring Americans on the nation's financial outlook, with more than 6 in 10 calling the economy poor, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research."
342,"Unfortunately, inflation isn't likely to return to its pre-2021 levels within the next few months, economists now predict."
343,"""Our sense is that the inflation and price increases will get worse in the near term before they get better,"" Bostjancic noted."
344,"Her forecast is that headline inflation — or inflation including gas and food prices — will stand at 5.3% in the first three months of 2022, but may start to ease in the second quarter."
345,"Goldman Sachs analysts, meanwhile, forecast inflation will return to about 2% — but not until late 2022."
346,"About half of Americans say they now expect the economy to worsen in the next year, compared with just 30% who think it will get better."
347,"In the AP-NORC poll conducted in February and March, the situation was reversed: 44% expected the economy to get better in the year ahead and just 32% said it would get worse."
348,"With inflation running well above its recent norm, all eyes are now on the Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin winding down its bond-buying stimulus program."
349,But economists say they will also be listening for whether the Fed plans to hasten plans to boost interest rates from their current level of almost zero — a move that could help tame inflation.
350,"For some consumers, the inflationary spike brings back memories of another era when inflation was high."
351,"""I grew up in the 1970s and I remember it was hard for my parents to make ends meet,"" Nadine Christian, 55, told the Associated Press."
352,"""It's not quite as bad as it was back then but I feel like any day we could go off the rails."""
353,"""Pent-up consumer demand""
 Inflation spiked higher this year due to the confluence of several pandemic trends, economists say."
354,"First, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021 spurred pent-up demand from consumers, millions of whom were flush with cash due to stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid."
355,"But at the same time, the U.S. workforce hasn't fully recovered from the pandemic."
356,"There are still 3.2 million fewer workers today than in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the economy."
357,"Among the businesses impacted by the labor force shortage are those in the supply chain — transportation companies, warehouses and other businesses that help move goods around the U.S.
 That's created what Bostjancic calls ""sticky supply-driven inflation."""
358,"""There was huge pent-up consumer demand, and demand came back sharply, and supply couldn't keep up,"" she added."
359,"But there's a risk if the Fed boosts interest rates more quickly than expected, Bostjancic noted."
360,"""You could have a double-jeopardy risk that they raise rates now to combat inflation, but that it kicks in just as supply comes online and demand moderates,"" she said."
361,"Utilities, food, paper goods
 Among the businesses impacted by inflation are restaurants, which are experiencing higher demand from consumers just as they're also facing higher costs for everything from food to ""some items in the middle of the P&L (profit & loss): utilities, paper goods, plates, small wares,"" said Jim Balis, managing director at restaurant investor CapitalSpring's Strategic Operations Group."
362,"Balis, whose company is invested in 60 different restaurant brands — although he can't disclose which ones — noted that their businesses saw an uptick in demand as vaccinations spread across the nation."
363,"Restaurant owners believed that workers would follow by returning to the labor market after the pandemic unemployment benefits expired in September, but that hasn't happened, Balis added."
364,"""There probably is some percentage that has said, 'I want to go back to work, but under different terms or conditions' — maybe they want to work in a fulfillment center, or younger populations like companies with a cause,"" he noted."
365,"And restaurants are also facing competition for workers, both from other industries that pay higher wages as well as rival dining establishments, he noted."
366,"That's prompting his company's restaurants to boost wages, which Balis estimates have risen by about 7% from a year earlier."
367,"So far, he said, workers aren't arguing they need higher wages due to inflation — restaurants are offering more to simply compete with rival employers, Balis said."
368,"Economists, meanwhile, are keeping their eyes on the potential for a so-called wage-price spiral, or when rising prices create pressure on wages, which then spirals as production costs rise due to higher wages, and so on."
369,"As costs of goods and payroll increases, Balis says his restaurants are boosting menu prices to maintain margins."
370,"So far, consumers aren't blinking, he added."
371,"""Fortunately, knock on wood, we have been able to [raise] prices to offset these pressures to protect margins,"" he said."
372,"""If there was ever a time the consumer was tolerant of those price increases, it is now."""

 Stocks continue to hit new all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve prepares to pull back on some of the extraordinary stimulus measures it put in place when the Covid-19 pandemic ground the US economy to a halt in March 2020."
374,New York (CNN Business) Stocks continue to hit new all-time highs even as the Federal Reserve prepares to pull back on some of the extraordinary stimulus measures it put in place when the Covid-19 pandemic ground the US economy to a halt in March 2020.
375,Fed chair Jerome Powell is widely expected to discuss plans for the central bank to start tapering its bond purchases at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
376,The Fed may even suggest that interest rate hikes could also be in the cards for the latter part of next year.
377,Rates have been at zero since March 2020.
378,"According to futures contracts on the CME , traders are pricing in a 33% chance of at least two interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, and a 25% chance of three rate increases by January 2023."
379,"So why aren't investors throwing a so-called taper tantrum, as they did when former Fed chair Ben Bernanke hinted that the Fed would soon slow down bond buying in the summer of 2013?"
380,"Back then, stocks fell sharply and long-term Treasury yields spiked."
381,"This time around, everyone knows that the tapering is coming."
382,Powell has been hinting for months that the economy is improving and may no longer need as much support from the Fed.
383,"That's a big difference from nearly a decade ago, when Bernanke caught the market completely off guard when he first suggested tapering
 ""The Fed has been telegraphing the taper for some time."
384,"They've learned a lot and do not want to make the same mistake twice,"" said Whitney Sweeney, investment strategist at Schroders."
385,"No taper tantrum as long as Fed sticks to playbook
 Even if Powell doesn't announce the taper timeline, the market might just throw a tantrum anyway, Sweeney said."
386,That's because investors want evidence the Fed is truly confident enough in the recovery that it can pull away the proverbial training wheels and see how the economy stands on its own.
387,"""A taper tantrum is unlikely to happen."
388,"But we have to wait to see how Powell discusses the rate hiking cycle,"" said Jim Caron, senior portfolio manager and chief strategist with Morgan Stanley Investment Management."
389,Caron said the Fed also seems willing to allow inflation to run a little hotter for the time being in hopes that prices start to fall next year once supply chain and labor market disruptions begin to abate.
390,That means the Fed would likely look to raise rates gradually instead of moving aggressively to counter fears of hyperinflation.
391,The market also seems to be growing confident that corporate taxes may not go up much —or even at all — anytime soon.
392,"That would be a gift to the Fed, too."
393,"""I don't see a corporate tax rate hike coming now."
394,"There are too many fires in Washington,"" said Dan Genter, CEO and chief investment officer of RNC Genter Capital Management."
395,"Powell, who like most Fed members sticks to the mantra that the central bank is apolitical, would likely not comment on any tax proposal."
396,But market observers think the Fed would have more wiggle room to taper and raise rates if it doesn't having to worry about how investors might react to the prospect of higher taxes eating into profit margins.
397,"""The Fed generally doesn't make a bet on political outcomes,"" Caron said."
398,"""But it will react to the Biden agenda going forward once the information is out."""
399,"In other words, Powell and other Fed members will be able to breathe a huge sigh of relief if DC gridlock prevents Biden from getting what he wants."
400,"""In theory, the Fed is independent,"" Sweeney said."
401,"""But higher taxes would have been a headwind."
402,"Absolutely."""
403,"Last December, with COVID-19 vaccinations only just beginning and the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised it would continue supporting the recovery with $120 billion in monthly bond purchases until there had been ""substantial further progress"" in meeting...
 WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Last December, with COVID-19 vaccinations only just beginning and the pandemic still raging, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised it would continue supporting the recovery with $120 billion in monthly bond purchases until there had been “substantial further progress” in meeting it goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment."
404,"At the end of its November policy meeting on Wednesday the central bank is likely to declare that standard met, clearing the way to trim $120 billion in monthly bond buying and eventually raise interest rates."
405,How substantial has the progress been?
406,"In the case of inflation, probably more than the Fed bargained for."
407,"The annual rate of price increases was 1.3%, measured by the Fed’s preferred Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, at the time the “substantial further progress” benchmark was set."
408,It has been more than 4% since May.
409,The job market has been more of a mixed picture.
410,"Employment has been slower to rebound, for example, than the overall level of economic output."
411,"Gross domestic product is now above where it was pre-pandemic, while jobs remain more than 3% below that level."
412,In one sense that’s a promising development because it means higher worker productivity - fewer people producing an increased amount of goods and services.
413,"But it also reflects a potential scar to the degree people who want to work aren’t getting hired, or, given the Fed’s new commitment to an inclusive recovery, to the degree job growth is not broadly shared."
414,"That’s where the story gets tricky, and makes a Fed declaration of substantial further progress very much a judgment call."
415,"When the Fed put the benchmark in place, the economy was about 10 million jobs short of where it was in February, 2020, before the first wave of pandemic layoffs."
416,About half of those jobs have been regained.
417,"Though 5 million missing jobs is a lot, Fed officials are banking that the record number of openings in the economy means the shortfall relates more to workers becoming choosier about the positions they will accept, an issue Fed policy can’t really address, rather than inadequate demand for labor, a problem it could confront."
418,"Dialing back the bond buying is the Fed’s way of saying that demand - for goods, services and workers - is strong enough now without that additional bit of help."
419,"But it is also a narrower view of the job market than the Fed seemed to adopt last year when it began referring to maximum employment as a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”
 A range of metrics - the unemployment rate for Blacks, the labor force participation rate for women, the share of the population overall that is working - remain significantly worse than before the pandemic."
420,In a broad sense progress may have been substantial over the last year.
421,"The Fed now turns to debating how much more progress is needed to meet its goals, on jobs in particular, and how much is possible while keeping inflation under control."
422,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to announce on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program as early as this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic."
423,"Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is set to announce on Wednesday it will begin to reduce its asset purchase program as early as this month, removing a first pillar of emergency monetary policy accommodation introduced in March 2020 to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic."
424,Here’s a guide to why and how the Fed is cutting back on this key component of its crisis-era support and what that means for the size of its future balance sheet.
425,WHAT IS THE FED’S ASSET PURCHASE PROGRAM?
426,"The Fed has gobbled up trillions in Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds since the onset of the pandemic in a process known as quantitative easing to lower long-term interest rates, keep financial conditions loose and help spur demand, similar to the playbook used following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession."
427,It currently buys $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in housing-backed securities each month.
428,"Since it began the program, the Fed’s balance sheet has swelled to $8.6 trillion from $4.4 trillion."
429,An $8 trillion stash of Treasuries and MBS account for most of its total holdings.
430,WHY WILL IT BEGIN TO TAPER THOSE PURCHASES?
431,"The economy, on pace to expand this year at the fastest rate since the 1980s, no longer needs such extreme measures of support and keeping them in place could do more harm than good."
432,"For example, low mortgage rates have fueled a boom in house prices, but the problems that now afflict the economy are mostly supply issues while demand, which the bond buys most directly affect, is buoyant and shows no sign of faltering."
433,“They are doing it because the economy is really strong...
434,"The economy can stand on its own,” said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and president of economic advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives."
435,HOW DOES TAPERING WORK?
436,"Most likely in mid-November, the Fed will each month begin to reduce the amount of Treasury securities purchases by $10 billion and mortgage-backed securities by $5 billion, phasing them out completely by next June."
437,"The Fed doesn’t stop the bond buys all at once “to avoid jolting financial markets and sending (market) rates higher than they would (naturally) be,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics."
438,Officials have flagged they expect the roll-off to run on autopilot but could speed up or slow the pace of purchases if need be.
439,"The expected eight-month pace of tapering is also much faster than last time, indicative of the Fed’s confidence in the sharpest recovery in decades and a desire to be in a position to raise interest rates from near zero next year if inflation remains persistently high."
440,WHAT NEXT FOR THE FED’S BALANCE SHEET POLICY?
441,"By next June, the Fed’s balance sheet will sit at just over $9 trillion, about $8.4 trillion of which will be bonds associated with multiple rounds of QE dating back to the financial crisis more than a decade ago."
442,The question is what to do after that.
443,"Last time, the Fed started to shrink its balance sheet two years after it began to raise its main short-term interest rate, also known as the Fed funds rate, by not replacing securities as they matured."
444,"Fed watchers think the central bank will also be patient and passive this time around, not least because it reduced the balance sheet too much in 2018-19."
445,"That resulted in demand for bank reserves outstripping the Fed’s supply, causing volatility in short-term money markets and a U-turn from the Fed, which was forced to increase the balance sheet again to improve financial market functioning."
446,"BUT IT WILL REDUCE ITS BALANCE SHEET, RIGHT?"
447,Not necessarily.
448,Last time around the Fed was focused on reducing its balance sheet because there was some discomfort with it as an untested policy tool.
449,"Having used their balance sheet as a main plank of policy twice since the Great Recession “officials now understand that it’s going to be brought out next recession and it’s going to be a tool in the toolkit,” said Coronado."
450,"One option, already flagged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, would be to just hold the balance sheet steady and let the economy grow into it."
451,"As gross domestic product grows, the balance sheet would effectively shrink as a percentage of GDP, exerting less influence over time."
452,"The total balance sheet as a share of nominal GDP is now almost 36%, roughly twice what it was before the pandemic."
453,"Others are not so sure, arguing that keeping too large a permanent balance sheet could limit its effectiveness come the next recession and might sway the Fed to reduce its size again."
454,“These numbers are big no matter how you look at them...
455,There are reasons to think about ‘normalizing’ some of these policy tools over time.
456,"I do think they will probably perceive some benefits, in that it will open up greater scope for doing more quantitative easing next time,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank."
457,WHAT DO FED POLICYMAKERS SAY?
458,"So far, few policymakers have weighed in decisively."
459,"Fed Governor Christopher Waller last month called for a shrinking of the balance sheet over the next couple of years by letting maturing securities roll off, similar to last time."
460,"Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in September the Fed may want to keep longer-term rates low by retaining a large balance sheet, but counter that stimulus with a higher Fed funds rate."
461,"That, however, might raise the risk of an inverted yield curve, an argument for shrinking the balance sheet, George also said, neatly illustrating the conundrum Fed officials face as they ramp up discussions in the months ahead."
462,"Gold prices eased on Wednesday, ahead of a crucial Federal Reserve decision, as investors await cues on the U.S. central bank's plan to taper its pandemic-induced stimulus amid signs of rising inflation."
