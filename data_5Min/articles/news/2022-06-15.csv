0,"The largest interest rate hike in 28 years, three-quarters of a percentage point, was announced by the Federal Reserve as it tries to rein in surging prices."
1,The Federal Reserve announcedits largest interest rate hike in 28 years on Wednesday in an attempt to battle the nation's continuing surge in inflation.
2,Financial experts have said the key to this strategy is supply and demand.
3,"The Federal Reserve—the nation's central bank, commonly called ""the Fed""—increased interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point."
4,The move comes after the government released new numbers for the consumer price index that showed annual inflation moderated in April.
5,"However, the index increased at an annual rate of 8.3 percent, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last Friday that inflation rose 8.6 percent from a year ago, the fastest increase since 1981."
6,"The Fed's plan, which was announced to the media by Chairman Jerome Powell, is to raise short-term interest rates to battle inflation."
7,"When discussing rising inflation, many experts point to the positive growth seen in the economy: More people have more money, but there are too few goods to buy."
8,This results in a rise in prices.
9,"For a better explanation of why the Fed is raising interest rates, The New York Times consulted with two experts for a story the newspaper ran on Tuesday."
10,"One was Kathy Jones, the chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, and the other was Edmund Phelps, a Columbia University economist."
11,They explained that the Fed is seeking to restore a balance in supply and demand with an increase in interest rates by making it more expensive to borrow money.
12,"In other words, the Fed's hope is that people will be discouraged from spending their money because of higher interest rates, which will decrease demand and eventually lower inflation."
13,One example discussed in the Times was the recent rise in mortgage rates.
14,"While this makes it more expensive to buy a house, inflation may not be affected in the short term because of the high demand for houses, a result of the coronavirus pandemic."
15,"While the Fed's interest rate increase can't address a housing shortage, higher rates could eventually address the relationship between supply and demand in a year or more, because fewer people will be taking on new mortgages."
16,"""By raising rates, the Fed is trying to make you slow down your spending."
17,"That happens when the cost of money goes up for a car loan or mortgage or something else you want to spend money on,"" Jones told the Times."
18,"""The higher cost of money reduces your purchasing power—what you can afford to buy—and the Fed is effectively making you buy less."
19,"And that should bring down inflation."""
20,"Phelps said the current economic situation is a result of ""aggregate demand exceeding supply, and that's causing prices to rise."""
21,"Therefore, he said, the Fed is trying to ""clamp down on demand"" by raising interest rates."
22,"Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, told CNBC that he thinks the interest rate hike may not be enough to address inflation."
23,"""Can the Fed bring down inflation on their own?"
24,"I think the answer is 'no,'"" Baird told the business news outlet."
25,"""They certainly can help rein in the demand side by higher interest rates."
26,"But it's not going to unload container ships, it's not going to reopen production capacity in China, it's not going to hire the long-haul truckers we need to get things across the country."""
27,"However, Baird noted that ""the Fed has been reasonably successful in convincing markets that they have their eye on the ball and long-term inflation expectations have been held in check."""
28,"He added, ""As we look forward, that will continue to be the primary focus."
29,"It's something that we're watching very closely, to make sure that investors don't lose faith in [the central bank's] ability to keep a lid on long-term inflation."""
30,"Update 6/15/22, 3 p.m."
31,ET: This story was updated with the Federal Reserve's announcement of its 0.75 percent interest rate hike.
32,"The rate hike was the biggest made by the U.S. central bank since 1994
 The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday to stem a disruptive surge in inflation, and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come."
33,"The rate hike was the biggest made by the U.S. central bank since 1994, and was delivered after recent data showed little progress in its inflation battle."
34,"U.S. central bank officials flagged a faster path of increases in borrowing costs to come as well, more closely aligning monetary policy with a rapid shift this week in financial market views of what it will take to bring price pressures under control."
35,"“Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures,” the central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement at the end of its latest two-day meeting in Washington."
36,"“The committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.”
 The statement continued to cite the Ukraine war and China lockdown policies as sources of inflation."
37,"The action raised the short-term federal funds rate to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%, and Fed officials at the median projected the rate increasing to 3.4% by the end of this year and to 3.8% in 2023 - a substantial shift from projections in March that saw the rate rising to 1.9% this year."
38,"The stricter monetary policy was accompanied with a downgrade to the Fed’s economic outlook, with the economy now seen slowing to a below-trend 1.7% rate of growth this year, unemployment rising to 3.7% by the end of this year, and continuing to rise to 4.1% through 2024."
39,"While no policymaker projected an outright recession, the range of economic growth forecasts edged toward zero in 2023 and the federal funds rate was seen falling in 2024."
40,The projections are a break with recent Fed efforts to cast tighter monetary policy and inflation control as consistent with steady and low unemployment.
41,The 4.1% jobless rate seen in 2024 is now slightly above the level Fed officials generally see as consistent with full employment.
42,"Since March, when Fed officials projected they could raise rates and control inflation with the unemployment rate remaining around 3.5%, inflation has stubbornly remained at a 40-year high, with no sign of it reaching the peak Fed policymakers hoped would arrive this spring."
43,"Even with the more aggressive interest rate measures taken on Wednesday, policymakers nevertheless see inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index at 5.2% through this year and slowing only gradually to 2.2% in 2024."
44,Kansas City Fed President Esther George was the only policymaker to dissent in Wednesday’s decision in preference for a half-percentage-point hike.
45,Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the latest policy meeting.
46,"Inflation has become the most pressing economic issue for the Fed and has begun to shape the political landscape as well, with household sentiment worsening amid rising food and gasoline prices."

50,"The last time the Federal Reserve raised rates by 75 basis points was in 1994, when Alan Greenspan brought the US economy down for a soft landing."
51,"This time, though, the Fed finds itself in very different conditions."
52,"The last time the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points, a Democratic president was in the second year of his term, the stock market had just enjoyed a buoyant couple of years, and a Tom Cruise movie was in the theaters."
53,"Not so different from now—except that it was 1994, no one was worrying about a recession, and there was no inflation to speak of."
54,"In November 1994, Alan Greenspan, the then-chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced a rate hike from 4.75% to 5.5%."
55,"Under Greenspan, the Fed had been slowly tightening the screws, after leaving rates untouched throughout 1993."
56,"From 3.25% in January 1994, the rates crept up all year, until they leaped those 75 basis points in November."
57,"To observers, and particularly to the Clinton White House, these moves were befuddling."
58,"Inflation was at its lowest in two decades, hovering around 2.7%, but with market indices thriving, Greenspan thought he felt the first licks of warmth from a heating economy."
59,"He was such a hawk that he favored raising rates preemptively—to the point, his critics said, of not allowing the economy to flourish."
60,"“Sometimes, when Greenspan was due to come over to the White House, the president would entertain his advisers with an imitation of the Fed chairman: a cheerless old man droning on about inflation,” wrote Sebastian Mallaby, Greenspan’s biographer."
61,"When Greenspan proposed the 75-basis-point hike to his colleagues, Mallaby added, “it was as though Greenspan had listened to [speaker Newt] Gingrich and Clinton wax lyrical about the economy’s potential and had resolved to pick a fight with both of them.”
 The soft landing of 1994
 In retrospect, economists think that Greenspan’s tightening brought the US down into a soft landing—a cooling of the markets that avoids the kind of recession often triggered by sharp, sudden rises in interest rates."
62,"Despite another rate increase by 50 basis points in February 1995, the Dow Jones rose more than 33% over the course of that year, showing that the economy’s spirits were unaffected by Greenspan’s great hike."
63,Inflation stayed mild.
64,"We will never know the counterfactual, of course; prices may have remained low anyway, thanks to the efficiencies of rapid globalization, and Greenspan may have nipped a larger economic boom in the bud."
65,"But as the phrase goes: no harm, no foul."
66,"Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, finds himself in a very different position."
67,"He is trying to fight already blazing fires with respect to both inflation, which has risen to 8.6%, and the plunging in the stock market."
68,"Fears of a recession abound, in large part because everyone expects the Fed will hit the brakes hard very soon to tame prices."
69,Powell wants a soft landing as well.
70,"Unlike Greenspan in 1994, though, he is already feeling turbulence."
71,Oil prices fell more than 1% on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point amid demand woes and as U.S. oil production reached pre-pandemic levels.

153,"As a refresher, UVIX aims to provide investors with 2x the daily percentage changes in near-term VIX futures."

158,"On the flip side, due to its levered nature, the instrument can also result in outsized losses relatively quickly."

165,Bear in mind that peculation has been growing over the past few days that the Fed might go full scorch-earth and hike rates by 100 bp or a full percentage.
166,"Even if we get a 75 bp increase today, it would still mark the fastest pace of interest rate hikes since the 1990s."

 Bear in mind that a rising interest rate environment, particularly when paired with near-term growth concerns, is an anathema for risk assets in general."
171,It is for this reason that equities have had one of the worst starts to the year in a very long time.
172,"Nonetheless, there is a section of analysts and high-profile investors who view a potential 100 bp hike by the Fed in a positive light, postulating that the sooner the Fed achieves its terminal interest rate target, the faster markets can calm down."
173,"Therefore, there remains a material probability that a market-wide rally might result in the aftermath of the FOMC’s decision, hammering UVIX in the process."
174,"Any rally, if it does materialize, would be short-lived, in our opinion, for the simple matter that the overarching goal of the Fed’s hawkish stance is to curb the ongoing inflationary impulse."
175,And curbing the wealth effect pervading the US economy by hammering risk assets is an integral part of this strategy.
176,"Consequently, as long as inflation remains near multi-decadal highs, any relief rally is likely to be met with a much more hawkish commentary from the Fed, thereby strengthening UVIX’s investment thesis for the time being."
177,"It is hardly surprising, therefore, that retail investors are paying attention to UVIX in this uncertain environment."

212,"""We're strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we're moving expeditiously to do so."""

215,"The latest move is only one part of a rate-hiking cycle, which aims to crush inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, as some fear could happen."
216,The Fed last raised rates by 75 basis points in November 1994.
217,"""The motivation for all of this is that prices are going up,"" said Chester Spatt, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business."
218,"""The Fed is trying to fight that with higher interest rates to reduce demand."""
219,"For consumers, this aggressive approach could eventually bring relief from surging prices."
220,It also comes at a cost.
221,"What the federal funds rate means to you
 The federal funds rate, which is set by the central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight."
222,"Although that's not the rate that consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and saving rates they see every day."
223,"""We're certainly going to see the cost of borrowing escalate relatively quickly,"" Spatt said."
224,"With the backdrop of rising rates and future economic uncertainty, there are specific steps consumers should be taking to stabilize their finances — including paying down debt, especially costly credit card and other variable rate debt, and increasing savings, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com."
225,"Pay down high-rate debt
 Since most credit cards have a variable interest rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark, so short-term borrowing rates are already heading higher."
226,"Credit card rates are currently 16.61%, on average, significantly higher than nearly every other consumer loan and may closer to 19% by the end of the year — which would be a new record, according to Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com."
227,"If the APR on your credit card rises to 18.61% by the end of 2022, it will cost you another $832 in interest charges over the lifetime of the loan, assuming you made minimum payments on the average $5,525 balance, Rossman calculated."
228,"If you're carrying a balance, try consolidating and paying off high-interest credit cards with a lower interest home equity loan or personal loan or switch to an interest-free balance transfer credit card, he advised."
229,"Consumers with an adjustable-rate mortgage or home equity lines of credit may also want to switch to a fixed rate, Spatt said."
230,"Because longer-term 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy, those homeowners won't be immediately impacted by a rate hike."
231,"However, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is also on the rise, reaching 6.28% this week — up more than three full percentage points from 3.11% at the end of December."
232,"""Given that they've already gone up so dramatically, it's difficult to say just how much higher mortgage rates will go by year's end,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst at LendingTree."
233,"On a $300,000 loan, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage would cost you about $1,283 a month at a 3.11% rate."
234,"If you paid 6.28% instead, that would cost an extra $570 a month or $6,840 more a year and another $205,319 over the lifetime of the loan, according to Grow's mortgage calculator."
235,"Even though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because the price for all cars is rising, so if you are planning to finance a new car, you'll shell out more in the months ahead."
236,"Federal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers won't be impacted immediately by a rate hike."
237,"However, if you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark."
238,That makes this a particularly good time identify the loans you have outstanding and see if refinancing makes sense.
239,"Hunt for higher savings rates
 While the Fed has no direct influence on deposit rates, they tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate."
240,"As a result, the savings account rate at some of the largest retail banks are barely above rock bottom, currently a mere 0.07%, on average."
241,"""The rates paid by bigger banks are largely unchanged so where you have your savings is really important,"" McBride said."
242,"Thanks, in part, to lower overhead expenses, the average online savings account rate is closer to 1%, much higher than the average rate from a traditional, brick-and-mortar bank."
243,"""If you have money sitting in a savings account earning 0.05%, moving that to a savings account paying 1% is an immediate twentyfold increase with further benefits still to come as interest rates rise,"" according to McBride."
244,"Top-yielding certificates of deposit, which pay about 1.5%, are even better than a high-yield savings account."
245,"However, because the inflation rate is now higher than all of these rates, any money in savings loses purchasing power over time."
246,"To that end, ""one main opportunity out there is the possibility of buying some I bonds from the U.S. government,"" Spatt said."
247,"These inflation-protected assets, backed by the federal government, are nearly risk-free and pay a 9.62% annual rate through October, the highest yield on record."
248,"Although there are purchase limits and you can't tap the money for at least one year, you'll score a much better return than a savings account or a one-year CD."
249,"What's coming next for interest rates
 Consumers should prepare for even higher interest rates in the coming months."
250,"Even though the Fed has already raised rates multiple times this year, more hikes are on the horizon as the central bank grapples with inflation."
251,"While expectations for those increases had been quarter and half-point hikes at each meeting, the central bank could hand out further 50 or 75 basis point increases if inflation doesn't start to cool down."

 May 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave investors a glimmer of hope that the central bank is unlikely to become more hawkish in coming months, though few see reason for long-term optimism in the face of soaring inflation and fears of slowing growth."
497,"The Fed delivered an expected 50 basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday, but said larger hikes were not on the table among policymakers, allaying some investors’ fears that the central bank would raise rates by 75 basis points in upcoming meetings."

 The coming weeks will show if markets take the Fed at its word."
499,"Plenty of factors could force the Fed into a more aggressive posture, and some investors continue to believe policymakers were initially too slow in reacting to surging inflation and will need to raise rates more than expected."

 Still, Powell’s message appeared to fuel the hopes of investors who believe markets may have already priced in the extent of Fed hawkishness for now."
501,"The S&P 500 (.SPX) roared to a 2.8% gain on Wednesday, its biggest since May 2020, while Treasuries also rallied."
502,"read more
 “I think the pain is mostly behind us,” said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist at Allspring Global."
503,"Powell “took 75 bps off the table and already talked up how core inflation is looking better, which could lower the path of rate hikes.”
 Expectations of a hawkish Fed have weighed heavily on markets this year."
504,"The S&P is down 10.7% from its highs following an 8.8% drop in April, the worst monthly decline since March 2020."
505,The ICE BoFA US Treasury Index is down 8.2% to its lowest level since May 2019.
506,"The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points in March, its first hike since 2018, and the market is pricing in some 191 basis points of tightening for the year."
507,"FEDWATCH
 Some market participants believe Powell’s comments – which envisaged 50-basis-point hikes each in June and July, potentially the steepest increases in the Fed funds rate since 1994 – showed the Fed has grown as hawkish as it's likely to get for the time being."
508,"“At this stage, we believe the Fed has pivoted to an appropriately hawkish stance and is likely done surprising markets for a while."
509,"We recommend focusing more on the data flow going forward, especially around labor and inflation,” analysts at BoFA Global Research wrote."
510,Investors will get a look at April inflation data next week; the March numbers showed consumer prices growing at their fastest clip in nearly four decades.
511,Signs that inflation is continuing to exceed market expectations could erode confidence in the Fed’s outlook and weaken asset prices.
512,"""Of course, whether today ultimately marks the 'peak hawkishness' moment... depends on the data, particularly the inflation data,"" wrote analysts at Natwest including Brian Daingerfield."
513,"For bulls, history may offer some hope, according to data from Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial."
514,"The S&P 500 has rallied back in 12 of the 21 instances since 1980 when it fell by double-digits in a single year, ending those years with a hefty average gain of 17%, the data showed."
515,"Some, however, saw few reasons for optimism, as markets still face issues including geopolitical uncertainty and sky-high commodity prices stemming from the war in Ukraine."
516,"“At least for today investors had a reason to come back to some parts of the equity market, but you haven’t really solved any issues that are plaguing markets,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute."
517,"“All Powell really did was take extreme measures off the table for now.”
 Samana remains underweight in small-cap equities, emerging market stocks, and industrial and financial stocks that benefit from sustained economic growth in anticipation of higher interest rates softening the economy."
518,"And although Powell said he was confident the Fed could tame inflation without pushing the economy into recession, some investors remained doubtful the central bank could engineer a so-called soft landing."
519,"“They’ve started too late in addressing inflation and we all know this, and the question is whether they will make a mistake the other way,” said Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager for the Osterweis Total Return Fund, which has its largest overweights in mortgages and corporate bonds."
520,"“Today’s market reaction is one of relief,"" he said, ""but tomorrow’s could be different once we move past the idea that the worst possible decision is off the table.”

 June 15 (UPI) -- As the Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates on Wednesday -- possibly by as much as three-quarters of a point -- mortgage demand in the United States is up, according to an industry report."
544,The Mortgage Bankers Association said in its weekly report that overall applications are up about 6.6% for the week -- but are way down compared to this same time last year.
545,"Advertisement
 Total mortgage applications, the MBA said, are down 53% over the past 12 months."

556,"The rate hike would hopefully curb inflation, but some investors fear it could push the U.S. into a recession."
557,WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is expected Wednesday to announce its largest interest rate hike since 1994 — a bigger increase than it had previously signaled and a sign that the central bank is struggling to restrain stubbornly high inflation.
558,"The central bank is considered likely to raise its benchmark short-term rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, far larger than the typical quarter-point increase, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%."
559,It will also likely forecast additional large rate hikes through the end of the year.
560,"A series of sizeable increases would heighten borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, likely leading to an economic slowdown and raising the risk of a recession."
561,The Fed's previous rate hikes have already had the effect of raising mortgage rates roughly 2 percentage points since the year began and have slowed home sales.
562,"Other central banks around the world are also acting swiftly to try to quell surging inflation, even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the U.S."
563,"The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter-point in July, its first increase in 11 years."
564,It could announce a larger hike in September if record-high levels of inflation persist.
565,"The global efforts to tighten credit are escalating the risk of a severe downturn in the United States, Europe and elsewhere."
566,"Last week, the World Bank warned of the threat of “stagflation” — slow growth accompanied by high inflation — around the world."
567,"By the end of 2022, the Fed will have raised its key rate as high as a range of 3.25% to 3.5%, some economists estimate, higher than what was forecast just a few weeks ago."
568,"At that level, the rate would likely be well above “neutral,” meaning at a level that would be intended to slow growth."
569,"In March, the Fed had forecast that it would raise rates only to a range of 1.75% to 2% by year's end."
570,"After the Fed's last meeting in May, when it raised its benchmark rate by a half-point, Chair Jerome Powell said that similar increases were “on the table” for the central bank's June and July meetings, should the economy “evolve in line with expectations.”
 But on Friday, the government reported that year-over-year inflation accelerated unexpectedly in May to 8.6%, the highest such level in four decades."
571,"Inflation has spread to nearly every corner of the economy, with costs rising for rents, gas, clothing, medical care, airline fares and clothing."
572,"Also on Friday, a consumer sentiment survey by the University of Michigan found that Americans’ expectations for future inflation are rising."
573,"That is a worrisome sign for the Fed, because expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect higher inflation in the future, they often change their behavior in ways that increase prices."
574,"For example, they may accelerate large purchases before they become more expensive."
575,Doing so can intensify demand and further fuel inflation.
576,The accelerated series of rate hikes now expected from the Fed will increase the likelihood of a recession in the next year or so.
577,"“I think we’re sort of past the point where a ‘soft landing’ is plausible,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at the investment bank Jeffries, referring to the Fed's effort to raise rates enough to slow growth but not so much as to cause a recession."
578,"“I think they’re going to have to cause a contraction.”
 A key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the Fed to slow inflation to its 2% target, it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending, wage gains and economic growth."
579,"Ultimately, the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise — something the Fed hasn't yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue Wednesday."
580,"“When you’re on the highway going 90 miles an hour and you miss your exit, slowing down is not going to help you,"" Markowska said."
581,"""You have to do a U-turn and go back.”
 Other central banks are also looking at jumbo rate hikes to combat inflation."

 CENTRAL ILLINOIS (WCIA) — State and federal authorities gathered to announce a return of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program—beginning today."
590,"“There was 20 million dollars in the Rebuild Illinois, that is a reappropriation,” Colleen Callahan said."
591,"“There was also some 35 million that was just waiting, and now when you add the 35 and 20 we really have 50 some million that can be utilized.”
 That is Director Colleen Callahan of the state Department of Natural Resources, who said farmers can apply for those funds beginning today at Farm Service Agency Offices."
592,"Jamie Diebal of the State FSA says, the funds help bolster the CRP."
593,"“CREP is just an extra division that we have a partnership with IDNR to allow extra incentives for producers,” Diebal said."
594,"Stu: Incentives, such as?"
595,"They get a 25% rental rate incentive, there is also no cap to the rental rate, that our normal CREP has, and they also get incentives though the state, extra cost share payments and that easement option,” Diebal said."
596,Michael Woods of the Illinois Department of Agriculture says CREP will filter crop nutrients out of water making its way to the Gulf of Mexico.
597,"“So the CREP program will protect those marginal lands, and provide another tool to our producers across the state,” Woods said."
598,“So we start thinking about nutrient loss reduction strategy we are trying to make change on basically 27 million acres for 72 thousand producers across the state of Illinois.
599,"Programs like CREP are an amazing tool that will help provide resources to mitigate some of the soil loss, as well as the nutrient loss on those marginal lands.”
 Grant Hammer who heads the Association of Soil and Water Conservation districts says his local members will help guide farmers through the process."
600,"“So Soil and Water Conservation districts or SWCDS have a truly unique relationship with local producers county-based organizations, they tend to know their farmers and have established relationships and so forth, and what the SWCDS to is help market the program locally, help walk the producer through the enrollment process, and really serve as a guide though the process,” Hammer said."
601,The CREP program will target nutrient reduction in the Illinois and Kaskaskia Watersheds.
602,"That’s our report from the farm, I’m Stu Ellis with WCIA-3, your local news leader."
603,The Federal Reserve may be set to announce the biggest rate hike since the 1990s.
604,Here's how that would impact your wallet.
605,"Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve turned to its most potent weapon — raising interest rates — to combat soaring inflation."
606,"But with consumer prices having only accelerated since then, Wall Street analysts say consumers and investors should gird for an even bigger hike this week as central bankers try to tame the nation's fiercest bout with inflation in 40 years."
607,"The Fed, which will announce its decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern time, could lift rates by 0.75%, according to analysts at TD Macro."
608,That would come after announcements of a 0.25% hike in March and a 0.5% move in May — with the latter marking the sharpest increase since 2000.
609,"If the Fed decides on a three-quarter point boost, it would be the first rate hike of that size since 1994."
610,"Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a report on Tuesday that they expect 0.75% hikes at the central bank's meetings both this week and in July, underscoring what they called a ""need for speed"" in clamping down on inflation."
611,"Indeed, speed is of the essence in confronting inflation, economists say."
612,"The Consumer Price Index, a broad basket of goods and services used to track inflation, surged 8.6% in May, from an 8.3% annual rate in April."
613,"Gasoline prices have continued to hit new highs almost daily amid depleted domestic production and Russia's war in Ukraine, while food and housing costs are also surging."
614,"With more inflation data under its belt, the Fed is likely to ratchet its rate hikes higher, some analysts say."
615,"""We believe this shows the Fed is more determined to do what it takes to end the inflation overshoot as rapidly as possible even if that raises the chance of a hard landing in 2023,"" TD Macro said in the report."
616,"To be sure, some Wall Street analysts continue to expect a more modest interest-rate hike increase on Wednesday, but others are tweaking their economic forecasts to factor in sharper monetary tightening."
617,"By year-end, the federal funds rate — the rate that determines borrowing between banks — could be almost twice as high as its pre-pandemic level of about 2%, according to forecasts."
618,"""It was just a few weeks ago that investors were forecasting the funds rate to be ~2.58% at the end of this year, but that number is now more than 100 [basis points] higher at 3.7%,"" analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge told clients in a research note."
619,"""And the 'terminal' funds rate (the level at which the Fed will stop hiking this cycle) is now seen north of 4%."""
620,Here's what the Fed jacking up interest rates could mean for your wallet.
621,What will the rate hike cost you?
622,"Every 0.25% increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate translates to an extra $25 a year in interest on $10,000 in debt."
623,"So a 0.75% increase would mean an extra $75 of interest for every $10,000 in debt."
624,Economists expect the Fed will continue to raise rates throughout the year as it battles inflation.
625,"Some analysts now forecast the central bank will announce another 0.75% increase in July, followed by two 0.5% hikes in September and November."
626,"By early 2023, the federal funds rate could be 3.75% to 4%, according to TD Macro."
627,That implies a rate increase of at least 2.75% higher than the current federal funds rate of 1%.
628,"For consumers, that means they could pay an additional $275 in interest for every $10,000 in debt."
629,How could it impact the stock market?
630,"The stock market has slumped this year amid various headwinds, including the impact of high inflation and the Fed's monetary tightening."
631,"But a bigger-than-expected interest rate increase on Wednesday ""could be welcomed by stocks,"" Crisafulli said."
632,"""It would represent a powerful signal by [Fed Chair Jerome Powell], help the Fed recapture control of the policy narrative and clamp down on the massive change in tightening forecasts,"" he noted."
633,"Credit cards, home equity lines of credit
 Credit card debt will become more expensive, with higher APRs hitting borrowers within one or two billing cycles after the Fed's announcement, according to LendingTree credit expert Matt Schulz."
634,"For instance, after the Fed's March hike, interest rates for credit cards increased for three-quarters of the 200 cards that Schulz reviews every month."
635,"Consumers with balances may want to consider a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan, Schulz said."
636,"Consumers can also ask their credit card companies for a lower rate, which research has shown is frequently successful."
637,"Credit with adjustable rates may also see an impact, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are based on the prime rate."
638,What's the impact on mortgage rates?
639,Mortgage rates have already surged in response to the Fed's rate increases this year.
640,"The average 30-year mortgage stood at 5.23% on June 9, according to Freddie Mac."
641,That's up from 2.96% a year earlier.
642,That is adding thousands to the annual cost of buying a property.
643,"For instance, a purchaser buying a $250,000 home with a 30-year fixed loan would pay about $3,600 more per year compared with what they would have paid a year earlier."
644,"But the Fed's next rate hike might already be baked into current mortgage rates, said Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst for LendingTree, in an email."
645,"""The Fed's rate hike may not mean that mortgage rates are going to significantly increase,"" he noted."
646,The housing market reflects one part of the economy where the Fed's rate increases are slowing demand.
647,"Channel added: ""These high rates have significantly dampened borrower desire to refinance current loans, and they're also showing signs of reducing demand for purchase mortgages as well."""
648,"Savings accounts, CDs
 When it comes to higher interest rates, the bright side for consumers is better yields from savings accounts and certificates of deposit."
649,"""Online deposit rate gains have accelerated after the last two Fed rate hikes."
650,"Further acceleration is expected"" with additional hikes, said Ken Tumin of DepositAccounts.com in an email."
651,"In May, the typical online savings account yield increased from 0.54% to 0.73%, while average yields on one-year online CDs rose from 1.70% to 2.53%, he noted."
652,"That's better than savers used to earn, but it's still far below the rate of inflation."
653,That means that savers are essentially eroding the value of their money by socking it into a savings account while inflation is running above 8%.

657,"Nasdaq futures increased by more than 1%, and Dow futures gained about 0.6%."
658,"Treasury yields declined, and the benchmark 10-year yield pulled back from a more than decade-high to below 3.4%."

660,Stocks slid and bond yields spiked this week as traders raced to price in the impact of a supersized interest rate hike from the Fed.
661,The central bank is now widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the first time since 1994.
662,"The likelihood of such a hike had been seen remote as recently as mid-last week, especially since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said clearly in May that policymakers were not actively considering an increase greater than 50 basis points."
663,"However, in the weeks since, the economic data have suggested the Fed's more measured moves have so far done little to address inflation, which set a fresh 40-year high in May."
664,And other recent data showed consumers' inflation near-term expectations have crept to near or all-time highs.
665,"""Given the gravity of the situation with inflation as it is now, even though it's kind of a surprise relative to what we've heard from the Fed in terms of what they said they were going to do, it looks like it's the right move,"" Tom Simons, Jefferies money market economist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday."
666,"""The markets are going to feel more confident about the Fed's credibility in terms of their ability to limit inflation."
667,"And overall, it's going to lead to a better positive outcome for the economy in the long run."""
668,"Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 14, 2022 in New York City."

 Others, however, have been less supportive of a 75 basis point hike and cast doubt about whether it would ultimately be a net positive for the economy."
670,"The risk of the Fed over-tightening, or raising interest rates more swiftly than markets and the economy can adjust to, could ultimately do more damage than good, some pundits argued."
671,"Story continues
 ""Our objection to this more aggressive action is that it is unnecessary, because the forces which have driven the recent inflation numbers are already fading,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Wednesday."
672,"""Slower wage gains, along with the rollover in the housing market, will depress rent growth, while airline fares are likely to fall over the summer in the wake of falling jet fuel prices, and vehicle prices will drop as inventories rise."""
673,"""The inflation fix will not be more effective if the Fed hikes by 75bp [basis points] today or next month, rather than 25bp, and the damage done to private sector wealth could inadvertently trigger a downturn which otherwise would be averted,"" Shepherdson added."
674,"""Less is not always more, but sometimes it is enough."""

 Experts and analysts said the Federal Reserve is expected to hike the interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) and it has already been factored in by the Indian Markets but its commentary on growth, inflation and future rate hikes will be a key watch out for."
691,"Here's what they say about the possible US Fed rate hike and its impact on India
 Even as the American economy, like others in the world, is facing high inflation and the pace is hitting 40-year high, the US central bank will today conclude its monetary policy meet and announce its decision on the interest rate hike."
692,Analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to hike the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps).
693,"They said a rate hike of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the Indian stock markets but the US Fed’s commentary on growth, inflation and future rate hikes will be the key watch out for."
694,"Here’s what they say about the possible US Fed rate hike and its impact on India:
 What is the Inflation Scenario In the US?"
695,"According to the latest data, consumer price inflation in the US increased 8.6 per cent year-on-year in May, which is the largest increase since December 1981 and followed an 8.3 per cent advance in April."
696,The prices in the US accelerated on the back of high fuel prices and costlier food.
697,"Natural gas prices in May jumped 8 per cent, the pace is the highest since October 2005, while electricity rate also rose 1.3 per cent."
698,Food prices in May rose 1.2 per cent as part of the impact of supply chain disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
699,Prices of dairy and related products also posted the largest gain since July 2007.
700,US Treasuries have jumped since the start of April and is above the 3 per cent mark.
701,"FOMC Meet: What Is Being Expected
 Given the latest inflation print of 8.6 per cent as against the US Federal Reserve’s target to control it under two per cent, most economists and analysts expect the American central bank to go for a 75-basis-point hike in the Fed fund rate."
702,"However, they said more than the rate hike, it’s the commentary that is important."
703,"Ravindra Rao, head (commodity research) at Kotak Securities, said, “The base case for the Fed was to raise the interest rate by 0.5 per cent at its June meeting."
704,"However, after the latest US inflation data, market players are seeing an increased possibility of a 0.75 per cent hike today.”
 He added that apart from the Fed decision, market players will also focus on economic projection as it will give more clarity about how the interest rate is expected to rise as well as what will be its impact on economic growth."
705,"V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “More than the quantum of the rate hike (50 or 75 bps), it would be the message from the Fed in the policy announcement that would determine the market direction."
706,"The market is prepared for a 75-bp rate hike and, therefore, that decision, if it comes, is unlikely to rattle markets.”
 Stating that inflation in the US is soaring and the market expects aggressive cuts, Arun Malhotra, founding partner & portfolio manager at CapGrow Capital Advisors, said the US Fed is expected to go for a 75-bp hike and another 50 bps in the next meeting."
707,What Will Be The Impact On India?
708,High inflation and the interest rate hikes in the US have been adversely affecting the Indian markets for quite some time.
709,Foreign portfolio investors are pulling out their money from the Indian market.
710,Experts said the possible rate hike by the US Fed of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the markets.
711,"Kotak Securities’ Rao said, “Fed’s aggressive stance is largely factored in."
712,"So, the possibility of a negative surprise is low."
713,"If Fed’s decision comes largely in line with expectations, there is a possibility we may see some correction in the US dollar which may help commodities recover.”
 The Sensex has decline about 1800 points in the past three days amid looming fears of stagflation and volatility ahead of the US Fed meeting decision."
714,The aggressive rate hike of 50-75 bps is mostly factored by the market but updated economic and interest rate forecasts to be detailed by the central bank’s will closely control the future trend.
715,"CapGrow’s Malhotra said, “The markets have factored in these hikes."
716,There will not be much of an impact.
717,Fed is trying for a smooth landing so as not to hurt growth.
718,"Wage inflation is still quite high, and the inflation numbers are not going down anytime soon."
719,"We may see some moderation by Q4CY22.”
 Foreign investors have pulled out about Rs 14,000 crore so far this month."
720,"With this, the net outflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from equities reached Rs 1.81 lakh crore so far in 2022, data with depositories showed."
721,"The outflows are adversely affecting the Indian currency also, which has touched its all-time lows multiple times in the past few months."

728,New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve knows it needs to demonstrate that it can get inflation under control — and fast.
729,"What's happening: Pressure on the Fed has increased after the most recent batch of government data showed that annual inflation jumped to 8.6% in May , which was higher than economists had expected."
730,Investors now believe the Fed will raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday.
731,That hasn't happened since 1994.
732,"""Definitely, we're going to see 75 basis points after this meeting,"" Bill Dudley, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told CNN."
733,But interest rates aren't the only tool at the Fed's disposal.
734,It's also beginning the process of shrinking its massive balance sheet after buying up trillions of dollars in financial assets during the Covid-19 pandemic.
735,"""Should the economy remain overheated and inflation remain stubborn, that is part of the policy matrix,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, told CNN Business."
736,"He thinks that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should make clear that, if necessary, the Fed could offload bonds at a quicker pace and start selling mortgage-backed securities, which could help ease pressure in the housing market."
737,"So-called ""shelter"" costs are rising at the fastest rate in decades ."
738,"That's concerning, since as a source of inflation, it tends to stick around."
739,"""Filling a tank of gas, people can look at that and say, 'Maybe next week will be cheaper,'"" said Ronald Temple, co-head of multi-asset and head of US equity at Lazard Asset Management."
740,"""Rent is a locked in expense for a year or two."""
741,"But ramping up balance sheet reduction — a process known as ""quantitative tightening,"" or QT — also carries risks."
742,The Fed has never undertaken a drawdown of this scale.
743,"After gobbling up government bonds and mortgage securities during the Great Recession, the Fed started paring its balance sheet — which then contained just $4.5 trillion in assets — in late 2017."
744,It halted the process in 2019 as markets panicked.
745,This time may be different.
746,"""Last time the Fed tried to do this, there was no inflation,"" Temple said."
747,"Still, he thinks the effects of quantitative tightening are likely to reverberate through markets."
748,"Stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies — all rallied dramatically when the Fed was in buying mode."
749,What happens as it changes course?
750,"""I think investors are underestimating the impact of QT,"" Temple said."
751,"""Central banks manipulated every market."""
752,"Layoffs rattle vulnerable industries
 So far, even as investors have fretted about what's next for America's economy, the job market has remained strong."
753,"US employers added 390,000 jobs in May ."
754,"That pace of hiring was robust, albeit slower than in April."
755,But industries vulnerable to rising interest rates and market churn are starting to cut roles.
756,That could portend rockier times ahead.
757,Crypto exchange Coinbase announced Tuesday that it's laying off 18% of its employees as the digital currency market crumbles.
758,"CEO Brian Armstrong said in an open letter that the ""difficult decision"" to lay off about 1,000 employees was made to ensure ""we stay healthy during this economic downturn."""
759,"The exchange has more than 4,900 employees."
760,"""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" he warned."
761,Step back: Coinbase's market value has imploded in recent months.
762,"One year ago, the company was worth almost $50 billion."
763,Now it's valued at less than $12 billion.
764,Crypto firms aren't the only ones facing pressure to control costs.
765,Real estate broker Redfin said Tuesday that it will lay off about 8% of its employees as it grapples with the rapid run-up in mortgage rates.
766,"""Mortgage rates increased faster than at any point in history,"" CEO Glenn Kelman told employees."
767,"""We could be facing years, not months, of fewer home sales."""
768,Redfin's stock has plunged almost 80% year-to-date.
769,Where did the 'bear' in bear market come from?
770,"This week, US stocks fell into a bear market, dropping more than 20% from their most recent peak in early January."
771,But why is a forest-dwelling mammal associated with scared investors dumping shares on Wall Street?
772,My colleague Allison Morrow did some digging.
773,"She found out that the term derives from ""bearskin,"" which was used in the 18th century as a metaphor for the kind of speculative trading known today as short-selling, or betting that a stock will go down."
774,"It comes from a proverb warning not to ""sell a bear's skin before one has caught the bear,"" according to Merriam-Webster."
775,"Bearskin got shortened to bear, and here we are."
776,"The term caught on after the South Sea Bubble of 1720, and again after the 1929 crash that led to the Great Depression."
777,Another idea is that a bear attacks by swiping its paws downward on its prey.
778,Downward swipe = stocks go down.
779,Seems as fair a hypothesis as any.

 The world’s financial markets are bracing themselves for the sharpest rise in US interest rates in almost 30 years, as America’s central bank takes action to halt rising inflation."
786,"After days of frenzied investor speculation and signs of growing central bank anxiety, the Federal Reserve is expected to increase the official cost of borrowing by 0.75 percentage points for the first time since 1994."
787,"The Fed meeting, with an interest rate announcement due at 7pm UK time on Wednesday, will be preceded by an emergency meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) to discuss crashing bond prices in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece."
788,"The Bank of England is expected to raise UK interest on Thursday, after the rise in UK inflation to a 40-year high."
789,"Despite some speculation of a 0.5 point increase, the City expects a 0.25 point rise to 1.25%."
790,"The Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, had previously ruled out a 0.75 point increase but the central bank appears to have had a change of heart after higher than expected US inflation was announced last week."
791,"News that the US measure of the cost of living had hit 8.6% – the highest in four decades – prompted a sharp sell off in both bonds and share prices, as investors took fright at the possibility of action to combat high inflation leading to recession."
792,"The S&P 500 index – a broad measure of the health of the US stock market – has fallen 20% since its peak in January, while the technology-rich Nasdaq index has dropped by a third."
793,"“Investors have now fully aligned with the view that the Fed will hike by 0.75 points today, following the unexpected acceleration in inflation and inflation expectations in May and media reports suggesting the option was being discussed by policymakers,” said analysts at ING bank."
794,"“While a 75 basis-point move is not certain, we doubt such potential ‘leaks’ to the media are a coincidence, and they do appear to us as a (successful) attempt to adjust expectations during the blackout period and prepare markets for the larger increase.”
 The prospect of a bigger than expected jump in US interest rates coupled with weak growth figures in the UK pushed the pound to its lowest level in two years against the US dollar."
795,"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk
 Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said of the ECB move: “Given there was a scheduled meeting last week, it smacks of panic and a lack of control, but the market is happy to see it happen."
796,"European bank shares rose and the euro also rallied, while Italian yields came back down.”
 Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “News that the ECB governing council is holding an emergency meeting today shows that policymakers are taking the threat of rising peripheral yields more seriously than they were last Thursday at their regular policy meeting.”
 The Fed statement and remarks by Powell at a press conference immediately afterwards will be scrutinised to see whether further sharp increases in US rates are likely."

821,"LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - With Britain's currency sinking and the U.S. Federal Reserve poised to raise borrowing costs aggressively, Bank of England policymakers may suddenly feel pressured to announce an outsized interest rate hike of their own this week."
822,"Even though Britain's economy shrank unexpectedly in April and there were some signs of inflationary forces in the labour market ebbing, the pound's slide and the increasingly hawkish stance of other central banks put the BoE in a tough spot."
823,"All but one of the 56 economists polled by Reuters last week expected the BoE to raise Bank Rate on Thursday to 1.25% from 1.0%, but many warn a rise to 1.5% could be a close call."

 Financial markets point to a roughly 43% chance of a 50 bps hike."
825,Recent events arguably show why.
826,"Sterling on Tuesday slid below $1.21, its lowest since May 2020 – a headache for members of the Monetary Policy Committee who know that a weak currency will exacerbate inflation in the months ahead, with Britain reliant on energy imports."
827,"The pound has fallen 4.5% against the dollar since late May, when finance minister Rishi Sunak announced further help for households facing a hefty cost-of-living hit - a package that economists had thought might shore up confidence in Britain's economic outlook, and with it the currency."
828,"The boost to sterling did not last long, however, as U.S. inflation accelerated more than expected, intensifying bets on Fed rate hikes."
829,"Last week, the European Central Bank flagged rate hikes at its next two meetings, including a possible half percentage-point rise in September."
830,"The BoE's trade-weighted sterling index , which measures the pound against a basket of currencies, fell on Monday to its lowest since January last year."
831,"Trade-weighted sterling slides to lowest since January 2021
 HAWKISH CENTRAL BANKS
 Brexit tensions - namely the escalating row over Northern Ireland's status that threatens to upend British trade ties with the European Union - have also hurt the pound."

 ""If the Bank starts to lag behind, then that would probably increase the downward pressure on the pound,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics."
835,"""That would actually influence the Bank of England's projections for its inflation target in three to four years time, which is what it's aiming for,"" he added."
836,Dales was the only economist in the Reuters poll to forecast a 50 basis-point increase in Bank Rate.
837,"Previous BoE research has suggested a 10% fall in sterling would raise the level of the consumer price index by about 2.7 percentage points, over a period of three to four years."
838,"REASONS NOT TO HIKE
 But some economists say the BoE should resist pressure to join other central banks in a rush to raise rates, given Britain looks more prone to recession than many of its peers."
839,The OECD sees zero British growth next year - the weakest of any G20 economy apart from Russia - and the British Chamber of Commerce expects the economy to shrink 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022 before growing just 0.6% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024.
840,"""What you wouldn't want to see is the MPC losing its independence of thought and joining a big cohort of central banks in a stampede to tighten aggressively,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec."
841,A 50 basis-point hike - which would be the first in Britain since February 1995 - would represent a presentational challenge for the BoE.
842,"Its chief economist Huw Pill has stressed the virtues of a ""steady-handed"", gradual approach to raising rates."
843,"The BoE was the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates in December last year and another hike on Thursday would be the fifth time in five policy meetings that it had increased borrowing costs, its steepest pace in 25 years."
844,Also there remains a question over whether five or more of the nine MPC members would plump for such a big rate hike.
845,"In May, only three external members - Jonathan Haskel, Michael Saunders and Catherine Mann - voted for a 50 basis-points hike."
846,"Even if they were joined on Thursday by Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden, who has previously sat on the hawkish end of the MPC, they would still need at least one more of the other members - none of whom have publicly expressed an appetite for moving in bigger steps."
847,Economists from Bank of America on Tuesday said their base case was for a 6-3 split in favour of a 25 basis-point hike.
848,"""We see risks skewed to a 5-4 vote and look for more hawkish guidance,"" they added."
849,"All BoE watchers are agreed, however, that the swirl of downbeat data, febrile financial markets and political pressure make predicting policy especially tricky."
850,"""It's quite easy for me to come out and say, 'go on, do this' but they have to make a decision that really makes a difference,"" Dales from Capital Economics said."

 June 15 (UPI) -- Amid persistent concerns about rising costs in the United States, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a policy meeting and is expected to do something it hasn't done in almost 30 years to get control of inflation."
857,Many analysts expect the Fed to hike interest rates by three-quarters of a point -- a sizable increase it hasn't made in decades.
858,The last time the central bank increased rates by that much was 1994 -- just before the U.S. economy boomed for the remainder of the 1990s.
859,"Advertisement
 When the Federal Reserve raises rates, it usually does so in quarter-point increments."
860,"But with consumer inflation rising at an annual rate of about 8.6%, which is far above the Fed's target range, analysts feel that the central bank has to be aggressive."
861,"The Fed increased rates by a half-point at its last policy meeting in early May, which was its largest increase since 2000."
862,"Advertisement
 Too much consumer spending combined with other certain market conditions can cause inflation to rise."
863,"By increasing interest rates, the Fed is attempting to get Americans to borrow less, lower demand and freeze prices."
864,The Federal Reserve will announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
865,"Goldman Sachs this week adjusted its forecast and expects a three-quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday and at the Fed's next policy meeting in July, followed by a half-point increase in September."
866,"From there, the Fed will make quarter-point hikes in November and December, the investment bank projected."
867,That would raise the federal funds rate to between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2022.
868,"Presently, interest rates are between 3/4% and 1%."
869,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed some optimism in March about a ""soft landing"" for the recovering economy, which has been disrupted by COVID-19 and the Russian war in Ukraine."
870,"Energy prices, notably gasoline, have been the primary driver of inflation over the past several months."
871,"Advertisement
 ""I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common,"" Powell said at the time."
872,"In 1994, then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan achieved a soft landing when interest rates reached 6% over seven different rate hikes -- including two half-point increases and a three-quarter-point increase to stem inflation after a recession in the early part of the 1990s."
873,"Some economists note, however, that Greenspan proactively raised rates to get ahead of inflation while Powell has mostly been reactionary."
874,Greenspan was also aided by a robust workforce as baby boomers entered the pinnacle of their careers and immigration numbers were strong.
875,"Today, Powell faces a different workforce that's been whittled down by the COVID-19 pandemic."
876,"""In the past, when you've pushed up the unemployment rate, you've almost never been able to avoid a full-fledged recession,"" former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley told CNN."

915,"Hooper remained hopeful that the U.S. will still be able to avoid a recession and that the Fed will succeed in engineering a ""soft landing"" by being sufficiently hawkish but data-responsive."
916,"However, she acknowledged that the U.S. economy is clearly heading toward a significant slowdown, and the ""soft landing"" is becoming harder to achieve."
917,"""Admittedly, slowing just enough to cool inflation but not cause a recession is an extremely delicate balancing act given that monetary policy is a blunt instrument, not a surgical tool."

922,"Stephane Monier, chief investment officer at Banque Lombard Odier, told CNBC on Wednesday that the decision to hold an unscheduled meeting prior to the Fed's announcement was significant."
923,"""It probably means to a certain extent that they are afraid that the Fed will be doing serious rate hikes like the 75 basis points that we are expecting, and that will somehow have some impact on risky assets in the market, and it will further increase fragmentation in European sovereign bond markets,"" Monier said."

943,"HOUSTON — Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Europe has desperately tried to find new sources of natural gas, including from the United States, to reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies."
944,Those efforts took a hit on Tuesday when an American gas company announced that it would take several months before it could repair a Texas export terminal that suffered a fire and explosion last Wednesday.
945,The suspension — which would affect roughly 14 percent of U.S. liquefied gas exports — was compounded by news that the Russian energy giant Gazprom would reduce its gas shipments to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline.
946,"The two announcements sent European gas prices 16 percent higher on Tuesday, since Europe’s prices are set regionally, not globally like oil."
947,"Natural gas prices in the United States moved in the opposite direction, plummeting more than 16 percent."
948,"When an explosion damaged part of the Freeport LNG terminal this month, officials said it would probably take three weeks to return the plant to normal functions."
949,"Gas prices, which had more than doubled since last year, dropped modestly."
950,"But on Tuesday, the company changed its public outlook and announced that it hoped a partial restart in 90 days was feasible."
951,"“At this time, completion of all necessary repairs and a return to full plant operations is not expected until late 2022,” the company said in a statement."
952,The Freeport facility is one of seven active export terminals that send supercooled gas around the world in supertankers.
953,"The temporary closing, by reducing how much gas can be exported, will add natural gas supplies in the United States, bringing some relief to residential electricity customers as well as to refineries and other industrial plants that use gas for power and as a vital raw material."
954,Gas that otherwise would have been exported will go into storage for use next winter since households in the United States will use less natural gas for heating during the summer months.
955,"“It’s significant for both the U.S. market and the global market,” said Lindsay Schneider, a natural gas expert at RBN Energy, a Houston consultancy."
956,"“It could mean lower prices here as more gas is available to refill storage inventories, and for global markets it means a loss of supply and potentially stronger prices in Europe and in Asia.”
 European countries are expanding their gas import facilities and pipelines, and they are lobbying Qatar, Australia and other exporters to hurry up and ship more gas."
957,"But Europe is in competition with Asian countries that look to gas to replace coal, a major pollutant of city air around China and India."
958,"While international markets are tight, the Freeport accident and decline in prices could bolster critics who say gas exports are raising domestic prices, which could go lower permanently if less were exported."
959,"That the closing of one export terminal “is having such a significant impact to prices” should be “alarming to federal policymakers,” said Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a lobbying group."
960,"Oil and gas companies counter that there is plenty of gas in shale fields around Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico and Arkansas for export and domestic use if only regulators would approve the building of more pipelines."
961,"While gasoline prices attract the most headlines, natural gas prices have surged over the last year and reached their highest level since 2008 last May, though they have eased in recent weeks."
962,"The explosion at the Texas plant, on Quintana Island, did not cause any injuries."
963,The fire ignited in some pipes between gas storage tanks and dock facilities used to transport the gas abroad.
964,Experts say it appears that the explosion occurred because of a rupture of piping and the ignition of a gas vapor cloud.
965,"Various state and federal agencies are investigating the explosion and fire, including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, better known by its acronym PHMSA."
966,"PHMSA has wide discretion in deciding whether a facility can come back on line, sometimes overriding an operator’s assessment."
967,Energy experts warned that problems at the Texas plant could take a long time to fix.
968,A fire at the Kinder Morgan terminal in Georgia took part of its operations off line for about 18 months because of difficulties with finding parts.
969,The Freeport plant has had problems over the last year with delayed maintenance and intermittent outages that were thought to be connected with impurities in some of its gas supplies.
970,"The United States has long exported gas to Canada and Mexico by pipeline, while liquefied natural gas exports have gradually grown over the last decade as domestic production has increased in shale fields around the country."
971,"In recent years most of the liquefied gas exports have gone to Asia, but since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a shift in sales to Europe, which has relied on Russia for 40 percent of its gas supplies."
972,"Four new American export terminals are under construction, while more than a dozen are waiting for the go-ahead from regulators and investors."
973,"Volatile markets price in a super-sized hike from the Federal Reserve following evidence of scorching inflation
 Bond investors are embracing safety in their portfolios as volatile markets price in a super-sized hike from the Federal Reserve following evidence of scorching inflation."
974,Investors have drastically shifted their expectations about Wednesday’s decision to a rate hike of 75 basis points (bps) - not the 50 bps the market was expecting last week.
975,"The increased hawkishness has sent equity markets tumbling and bond yields surging, briefly inverting the yield curve and pushing stocks into a bear market."
976,"Many investors support the Fed moving faster to dampen inflation, but they worry about the risk of recession."
977,"“A surprise 75 basis-point hike would be a happy one,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona."
978,“The question is whether the economy can avoid recession and that would depend on what the Fed does.
979,"If the Fed raised by 50 and they say they’re willing to consider 75, then we know that they’re not going to get ahead of inflation."
980,"You need to front-end load the hikes.”
 Tengler said her firm has been “defensive” in its bond portfolios, shortening duration and increasing the underlying quality of the assets."
981,Shorter-duration debt typically outperforms longer-dated debt in a rising rate environment.
982,"Overall, futures on the fed funds rate, or the rate on unsecured overnight loans between banks, now reflect an 87% chance of a 75 bps rate hike on Wednesday, and a 75% probability of another such increase in July."
983,The market has also factored in a fed funds rate of 4% by the summer next year.
984,"Pershing Square Capital Management founder and chief executive officer Bill Ackman, in comments on Twitter on Tuesday, pushed for multiple 75 bps hikes, noting that market confidence in the Fed can only be restored if it delivers on what the market expects."
985,The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year.
986,"It also began to shrink its balance sheet this month, a process called quantitative tightening."
987,"The Fed’s balance sheet ballooned to nearly $9 trillion as part of its pandemic policy accommodation
 The recent big spike in inflation was a major catalyst to the shift in expectations."
988,"Last Friday, data showed that in the 12 months through May, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.6%, the largest year-on-year increase in roughly 40 years."
989,"BOND MARKET BETS
 Ahead of the Fed decision, fixed income market players have kept short duration bets."
990,"Some, however, have reduced those short-maturity trades, believing there are opportunities in the market given how credit spreads have widened and how rates have risen significantly since the beginning of the year."
991,“We are still short duration albeit to a lesser degree.
992,"We have been upgrading the quality of our portfolios under the premise that choppier markets and tighter monetary policies should cause credit spreads to widen,” said R.J. Gallo, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes in Pittsburgh."
993,"His portfolios are also slightly overweight Treasuries and even though their duration is short, “we still like the high-quality nature of Treasuries for playing defense.”
 But despite the Fed’s aggressive tightening, bond investors see opportunities in the fixed income space and for some, it may be time to start moving away from safety bets."
994,"“At this point, being incredibly conservative from both a credit and duration standpoint is not the right place to be,” said Jason Brady, chief executive officer at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, overseeing $46 billion in assets."
995,"“That’s where we were and we’re moving away from that.”
 From a credit spread standpoint, Brady said his firm has become marginally less conservative."
996,"Brady, for instance, cited U.S. high yield debt, with its spread to Treasuries widening to 487 basis points on Monday."
997,"On top of a 3.5% yield in U.S. five-year Treasuries, he noted that an investor would net a more than 7% yield, which is “not terrible.”
 David Petrosinelli, managing director at broker-dealer InspereX in New York, has also been advising investors to be defensive in bond portfolios since the fourth quarter of last year, but still believes the Fed could slow the pace of tightening later this year."
998,"He recommends a barbell strategy, which combines short and long maturity bonds."
999,"If rates rise, the investor will have the opportunity to reinvest the proceeds of the shorter-term securities at the higher rate."
1000,Petrosinelli believes the Fed’s aggressive hikes this year will lead to a dramatic tail-off in consumption by end-2022.
1001,“That’s going to slow the Fed down in the fourth quarter in terms of hiking rates.
1002,"They will still need to raise rates, but the magnitude is going to decline quickly.”

1005,"Persistent worries over surging inflation and an aggressive Federal Reserve continue to pressure asset prices
 Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, June 14.Seth Wenig/The Associated Press
 Despite a crushing selloff that pushed U.S. stocks into a bear market, investors see few signs suggesting equities have hit bottom, as persistent worries over surging inflation and an aggressive Federal Reserve continue to pressure asset prices."
1006,The market’s losses have been steep.
1007,"The 21.3% year-to-date decline in the S&P 500 as of Monday wiped out some $8.7 trillion in market value this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices."
1008,"Meanwhile, the highest inflation rise in four decades has investors pricing in a once-unthinkable 75 basis-point rate increase at the Fed’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and worries are growing that the central bank won’t be able to tame consumer prices without tipping the economy into a recession."
1009,"Some strategists, however, are not convinced that all the factors are in place to mark the end of the declines."
1010,"“This is not necessarily what a bottom looks like,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide."
1011,"“It is perhaps what a bottoming process looks like.”
 The S&P 500 on Tuesday ended down 22.1% from its Jan 3 record peak."
1012,"The average decline for bear markets since 1946 has been 32.7%, according to investment research firm CFRA, which may suggest the current slide may have more room to run."
1013,"Similarly, the average bear market has lasted 389 calendar days from the peak to the bottom, more than twice as long as the current bear slide."
1014,Hackett and other market participants are also watching a number of technical signs indicating that selling in stocks may have reached a crescendo.
1015,"One of the more famous indicators is the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which is known as “Wall Street’s fear gauge” and measures the expectation of stock-market volatility as expressed by options prices."
1016,"Since 1990, the volatility index has reached an average level of 37 at market bottoms, and spiked to 85 during the market’s coronavirus-fueled swoon of March 2020."
1017,"By contrast, the VIX rose to 35.05 during Monday’s selloff: above its long-term median of about 18, but still below peak levels in other bear markets."
1018,"“It feels like investors are less panicked and more resigned to the fact that the next 6-12 months is going to be a slog (and elevated volatility is here to stay longer),” wrote Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, commenting on VIX contracts going out into the next year."
1019,"Still, volume on puts, which investors use to protect their portfolios from stock declines, hit 2.03 million contracts on Monday, the highest level since Fed 28, 2020, according to Trade Alert data."
1020,"Some also watch indicators on investor sentiment, with the hopes of potentially swooping into the markets when pessimism is high and selling is becoming exhausted."
1021,Many such indicators show sentiment has soured.
1022,"The latest weekly survey of the American Association of Individual Investors, for example, found bearish sentiment at 46.9% – topping its long term average of 30.5% but still below levels from earlier this year."
1023,Those readings came before the higher-than-expected inflation reading on Friday that sent stocks tumbling and could sour investor sentiment further.
1024,"“Investor sentiment has been negative for a while now and that is a sign telling us we might be getting there as a bottom but we are not quite there yet,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones."
1025,"Technical indicators aside, Kourkafas said it will be difficult for the market to fully bottom until investors are confident inflation has ebbed, allowing the Fed to ease back on its monetary tightening."
1026,"Others, however, are urging investors to focus on the long-term."
1027,"Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, notes that less than 5% of S&P 500 stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average."
1028,"That’s only happened nine times since 1990, and the S&P 500 was up in every single case a year later, with an average gain of 23%."
1029,"“Given the market is already pricing in a high probability of recession, that stocks are very oversold on several metrics, that valuations (while not cheap) have been reset, and sentiment is depressed, we would not reduce equities,” he wrote in a Tuesday report."
