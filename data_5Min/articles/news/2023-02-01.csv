 Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to announce a quarter point increase on the benchmark interest rate Wednesday following the first policy meeting of the year for the U.S. Federal Reserve."
42,"Wall Street braced for a 0.25-point rate increase after the nation's central bank took more aggressive moves on interest over the past year, increasing rates by half a point in December, preceded by four other 0.75-point rate hikes due to persistent inflation."
43,"Advertisement
 Inflation has slowed and the stock market has looked resilient for several months, with many economists crediting the Fed's recent actions as several key economic indicators show inflation easing after peaking last October."
44,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by more than 200 points Wednesday in anticipation of the 2 p.m. announcement, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Powell, who was not expected to provide any new economic forecasts for the nation."
45,"Advertisement
 Wary investors were expecting a less severe hike this time around, which would put the federal funds rate target at 4.5% to 4.75%, up from the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%."
46,"A year ago, the benchmark rate was near zero."
47,Wednesday's move also would amount to the smallest rate hike by the Fed since last March.
48,"At the last central bank meeting in December, the Fed raised interest rates by another half a percentage point, bringing the benchmark interest rate to the highest point in 15 years."
49,"At the time, the panel of governors projected interest rates would climb above 5% and remain there for all of 2023."
50,"Previously, several central bank officials indicated the pace of interest rate hikes would slow as the economy begins to settle from the current conditions."
51,"""There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase at the FOMC's next meeting at the end of this month,"" Fed Governor Chris Waller said earlier this month."
52,"For now, inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target rate but has shown some signs of weakening in recent months, with government data showing a year-over-year drop in inflation in December, which was the slowest rate of increase in more than a year."
53,"Advertisement
 In another good sign, the Wholesale Producer Price Index inflation dropped by 0.5% in December, and PPI inflation was 6.2% in 2022 compared to 10% in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."
54,And almost half of that wholesale inflation decrease was from a 13.4% drop in gasoline prices.
55,"Federal data published last week on personal income and spending showed some of the inflationary strains are starting to catch up with consumers, though it's unlikely the world's largest economy will experience a major recession."
56,"The Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the Commerce Department, reported personal income increased by 0.2% in December to $49.6 billion, disposable income increased by 0.3% to $49.2 billion, but spending took a hit, declining by 0.2% from November levels to $41.6 billion."
57,"Financial experts said the latest economic data might lead the Fed to acknowledge that inflation was finally slowing and the economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but Powell was also known to be predictably measured in his words to head off volatility on Wall Street."
58,"""Fed Chair Powell will need to acknowledge encouraging inflation data that's come in,"" said Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley."
59,"""This is not a one off."
60,"We have had had three months of encouraging data."""
61,"Advertisement
 Some insiders said they believed the central bank would keep this latest hike in place for the remainder of the year, while other insiders said they would be listening for any indication of when the Fed could potentially scrap the ongoing rate increases down the road."
62,"""There could be one last hawkish sting in the tail,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics."
63,"""We expect [Wednesday's] statement to maintain the language that 'ongoing increases' (emphasis on the plural) in rates will be required and, to counter the recent easing in financial conditions, forward guidance could be added that commits to leaving rates at elevated levels for some time."""
64,"Still, across the wider landscape of the American economy there remained many other troubling signs."
65,Several big tech giants have announced massive layoffs in recent months while consumer spending ability has been decimated by the high price of gas and utilities.
66,"Consumer-level inflation is cooling off from the double-digit levels that gripped the U.S. economy during summer 2022, but prices, particularly at the grocery store, remain stubbornly high, with eggs in particular experiencing an exponential gain in prices at the retail level."
67,The core consumer price index -- which tracks longterm inflation but excludes food and energy costs -- grew by 0.3% in December after increasing 0.2% the previous month.
68,"Advertisement
 Spending in November improved by 0.1% from October levels, suggesting inflationary pressures were mounting for consumers."
69,"In their first meeting of the year, Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to raise rates by a quarter point, a smaller increase than in recent meetings."
70,"But what they say about their next moves is more important for consumers, businesses and markets."
71,"Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise."
72,"As the Federal Reserve has lifted its key interest rate several times over the past year, Americans have seen the effects on both sides of the household ledger: Savers benefit from higher yields, but borrowers pay more."
73,"Here’s how it works:
 Credit Cards
 Credit card rates are closely linked to the Fed’s actions, so consumers with revolving debt can expect to see those rates rise, usually within one or two billing cycles."
74,"The average credit card rate was 19.9 percent as of Jan. 25, according to Bankrate.com, up from around 16 percent in March last year, when the Fed began its series of rate increases."
75,"Car Loans
 Car loans tend to track the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed’s key rate — but that’s not the only factor that determines how much you’ll pay."
76,"A borrower’s credit history, the type of vehicle, loan term and down payment are all baked into that rate calculation."
77,"The average interest rate on new-car loans was 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter last year, according to Edmunds, up from 4.1 percent in the same period a year earlier."
78,"Student Loans
 Whether the rate increase will affect your student loan payments depends on the type of loan you have."
79,"The rate for current federal student loan borrowers — many of whom will see up to $20,000 in loans canceled under a Department of Education program, subject to legal challenges — aren’t affected because those loans carry a fixed rate set by the government."
80,"But new batches of federal loans are priced each July, based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May."
81,"Rates on those loans have already jumped: Borrowers with federal undergraduate loans disbursed after July 1 (and before July 1, 2023) will pay 4.99 percent, up from 3.73 percent for loans disbursed the year-earlier period."
82,Borrowers of private student loans should also expect to pay more: Both fixed- and variable-rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate.
83,Those increases usually show up within a month.
84,"Mortgages
 Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages don’t move in tandem with the Fed’s benchmark rate, but instead generally track the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations around inflation, the Fed’s actions and how investors react to all of it."
85,"After climbing above 7 percent in November, for the first time since 2002, mortgage rates had fallen to 6.13 percent in the week through Jan. 26, according to Freddie Mac."
86,The average rate for an identical loan was 3.55 percent the same week in 2021.
87,Other home loans are more closely tethered to the Fed’s move.
88,Home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages — which each carry variable interest rates — generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed’s rates.
89,"Savings Vehicles
 Savers seeking a better return on their money will have an easier time — yields have been rising, but not uniformly."
90,"An increase in the Fed’s key rate often means banks will pay more interest on their deposits, though it doesn’t always happen right away."
91,"They tend to raise their rates when they want to bring more money in — many banks already had plenty of deposits, but that may be changing at some institutions."
92,"Primis Bank, for example, recently introduced online savings and checking accounts with a 5.03 percent rate."
93,"But rates at many of the larger online banks — including Ally, American Express, Capital One, Discover and Marcus — were still 3.3 percent, according to Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com, part of LendingTree."
94,"“I expect some more upward movement after today’s Fed rate hike,” Mr. Tumin said, “but it appears online banks are generally not in a rush to hike their deposit rates now.”
 Rates on certificates of deposit, which tend to track similarly dated Treasury securities, have been ticking higher."
95,The average one-year C.D.
96,"at online banks was 4.4 percent at the start of January, up from 0.5 percent a year earlier, according to DepositAccounts.com."
97,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak with the press following the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is expected to result in a quarter-point rate increase, the smallest hike in almost a year."
98,"The expected increase is the eighth in a series begun in March 2022 aimed at curbing high inflation.…

99,The expected increase is the eighth in a series begun in March 2022 aimed at curbing high inflation.
100,"Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index trended slightly downward to 6.5 percent in December 2022, although it remains considerably higher than pre-pandemic figures, and far short of the Fed’s goal of two percent."
101,"The rate increases are meant to slow the economy, which in turn should lower consumer prices."

106,"U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, delivering a setback to the Federal Reserve's effort to cool a hot job market."
107,"Paul Wiseman , The Associated Press
 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. job openings rose to 11 million in December, delivering a setback to the Federal Reserve's effort to cool a hot job market."
108,"Openings were up from 10.44 million in November and were the highest since July, according to data released Wednesday by the Labor Department."
109,Economists had expected job openings to drop slightly in December.
110,"For 18 straight months, employers have posted at least 10 million openings — a level never reached before 2021 in Labor Department data going back to 2000."
111,The number of openings in December meant that there were about two vacancies for every unemployed American.
112,"Employers hired 6.17 million workers in December, up from 6.03 million in November."
113,"Still, layoffs and discharges blipped up to 1.47 million in December from 1.42 million in November."
114,And the number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign they have confidence they can find a better opportunities elsewhere — fell slightly in December.
115,"Hotels, restaurants and bars accounted for more than 70% of the December increase in job openings."
116,The American job market has been surprisingly resilient throughout this period of economic uncertainty.
117,"Employers created 375,000 jobs a month in 2022 — second most in Labor Department records dating back to 1940 — and likely added another 185,000 last month, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet."
118,January's hiring numbers come out Friday.
119,"Hiring has remained strong even in the face of rising interest rates, which can increase costs for businesses."
120,"Combating inflation that last year hit a four-decade high, the Federal Reserve has hiked its benchmark rate seven times since March and is expected to announce another rate hike later Wednesday."
121,Fed policymakers are aiming for a soft landing — slowing the economy enough to contain inflation without causing much economic pain.
122,One hope was that that employers would cut job openings — and ease upward pressure on wages that can feed inflation — and without actually cutting many jobs.
123,"“With Fed officials hoping for signs of slowing hiring to support wage growth deceleration, every data point matters,'' said Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics."
124,“The December report unfortunately offered the opposite ... showcasing the stubborn resiliency of the labor market.''
125,Many economists believe the Fed rate hikes will slow the economy enough to cause a recession later this year.

 If the Federal Reserve really wants to move some of the mountain of cash now residing in its overnight reverse repo facility, technical changes in its rate control toolkit would do the trick, some central bank watchers say."
182,"NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - If the Federal Reserve really wants to move some of the mountain of cash now residing in its overnight reverse repo facility, technical changes in its rate control toolkit would do the trick, some central bank watchers say."
183,"The tweaks they envision are not shifts in the federal funds target rate, the central bank’s main tool for influencing the economy to achieve its job and inflation goals."
184,"Instead, it comes down to changing the setting of two other rates relative to the fed funds range in a way that departs from recent practice but could nudge money market funds to seek another home for some of the $2 trillion a day now deposited at the Fed."
185,Those two rates exist to keep the market-driven fed funds rate in the desired range.
186,"One, called the reverse repo rate, sets a floor underneath short-term rates, while another, which pays deposit-taking banks to park cash at the Fed, sets the high end."
187,"The reverse repo facility takes in cash from money market funds and other eligible firms, and currently pays an annualized rate of 4.30% for overnight loans of cash, compared to the current federal funds rate range of between 4.25% and 4.5%."
188,The Fed is widely expected to raise the target rate to 4.5% to 4.75% at Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
189,"If it sticks to recent practice, it will raise the reverse repo and the interest on reserve balances rate, now at 4.4%, by the same 25 basis point increment."
190,"TWEAK NOW OR LATER
 But some Fed watchers say the central bank has a choice, one it could take this week or later."
191,"And if it does do a tweak now, it would be unlike past tweaks."
192,"Those adjustments happened purely to ensure control of the fed funds rate, while this sort of move would speak more directly to bigger monetary policy concerns around managing the size of its $8.5 trillion balance sheet."
193,The reverse repo facility has seen sustained inflows of over $2 trillion per day since last June and has failed to contract as many policymakers expected.
194,"On many days, the facility offers the highest overnight rate available to many firms, so it’s a no brainer for them to skip the private market and park cash at the Fed."
195,"“If [policymakers] wanted a small balance sheet, they could reduce the overnight [reverse repo rate]” relative to the federal funds rate “and that would drive money out of overnight [reverse repo,] drive it into reserves,” which would in turn give them more space to cut the size of their balance sheet, said William English, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management who is formerly a top Federal Reserve staff member."
196,"Given the strong chance of a quarter percentage point increase Wednesday, Bill Nelson, who is also a former top Fed staffer and now serves as chief economist with Bank Policy Institute, said the Fed could once again make the reverse repo rate match the bottom end of the new federal funds rate range, with the interest on reserves rate matching the top."
197,"Doing this change now ""would probably be easier to explain and less newsworthy than making the change at some other time or to some other configuration,” Nelson said."
198,"The Fed has tweaked the relative rate settings several times since adopting its so-called abundant-reserves approach after the financial crisis, and pursuing Nelson’s suggestion would mark the first time since June 2018 that the interest on reserves and reverse repo rates were set to match the upper and lower bounds of the fed funds range."
199,Some in the market fear rate control toolkit tweaks might create unneeded headaches if done too aggressively.
200,"Scott Skyrm, of money market trading firm Curvature Securities, warned that should the Fed straight up hold the reverse repo rate at 4.3%, which would be unlikely, ""it would create a severe dislocation in overnight rates…Imagine $2 trillion entering the repo market over a course of a few days.”
 Instead, Skrym expects the Fed to bump the two rates up by the same amount as the federal funds rate on Wednesday, in line with its recent practice."

 WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. job openings unexpectedly rose in December, showing demand for labor remains strong despite higher interest rates and mounting fears of a recession, which could keep the Federal Reserve on its policy tightening path."
204,"There were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in December, the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, showed on Wednesday."

 ""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back."
247,"Consumers will likely continue to feel the double-edged effects of both continued inflation and high interest rates for at least a while longer and may seek to shed high interest-debt via personal loans or other lower-interest loan products."""
248,"ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target."
249,"They are specifically looking at the non-housing services portion of the PCE and as long as wages are still growing at 5-ish% you are not going to see the Fed back off."""
250,"""One thing that struck me about the statement is that they had a very slightly dovish change in the language where they previously had talked about determining the pace of future increases and now they are talking about determining the extent of future increases."
251,"So they did 25, the market is pricing in two more 25s, that is probably right but the question is going to be what is the terminal rate, when do they stop and when do they start to cut again."
252,"But what they have said here is this is a little more dovish than it might have been because they are not talking about the pace anymore."""
253,"""This basically takes 50 off the table, not that it was necessarily on, but the language last time could have defended 50 and now that is off the table."
254,"They have to see those wages come down."""
255,"RYAN DETRICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CARSON GROUP, OMAHA
 ""The Fed threw no curve balls, as they did what was widely expected."

257,"""The economy is still growing, which is comforting as (the Fed is) not worried of an impending recession."""

 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point."
578,The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication that it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle.
579,"Aligning with market expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point."
580,"That takes it to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007."
581,The move marked the eighth increase in a process that began in March 2022.
582,"By itself, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, but it also spills through to many consumer debt products."
583,"The Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s."
584,"The post-meeting statement noted that inflation ""has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" a tweak on previous language."
585,"Markets, however, were looking to this week's meeting for signs that the Fed would be ending the rate increases soon."
586,But the statement provided no such signals.
587,"Stocks sold off in the wake of the announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 300 points."
588,"The document included language noting that the FOMC still sees the need for ""ongoing increases in the target range."""
589,"Market participants had been hoping for some softening of the phrase, but the statement, approved unanimously, kept it intact."
590,The statement did alter one part when describing what will determine the future policy path.
591,"Officials said they would determine the ""extent"" of future rate increases based on factors such as the effects so far of the rate hikes, the lags in which policy has an impact, and developments in financial conditions and the economy."
592,"Previously, the statement said it would use those factors to determine the ""pace"" of future hikes, a possible nod that the committee sees an end to the increases somewhere, or at least a continuation of smaller moves ahead."
593,"In 2022, the Fed approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves before going to a smaller 0.5 percentage point increase in December."
594,"In recent public statements, multiple officials said they think the Fed at least can scale back on the size of the increases, without signaling when they could end."
595,"While it was raising its benchmark rate, the committee characterized economic growth as ""modest"" though it noted only that unemployment ""has remained low."""
596,"The latest job market assessment omitted previous language that employment gains have been ""robust."""
597,"Otherwise, the statement remained intact from previous messages as the Fed continues its efforts to arrest inflation."
598,"Fed policy is thought to work on a lag – when the central bank raises rates, it takes time for the economy to adjust to tighter controls on money."
599,This particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services.
600,"The war in Ukraine aggravated rising gas prices, while unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus fueled rising costs across a variety of goods and services."
601,Food prices have risen more than 10% over the past year.
602,"Egg prices alone have soared 60%, butter is up more than 31% and lettuce has jumped 25%, according to Labor Department data through December."
603,"Gas prices were ticking lower towards the end of 2022 but have popped higher in recent days, hitting $3.50 a gallon nationally for an increase of about 30 cents over the past month, according to AAA."
604,"Fed officials have remained resolute about tackling inflation, though they have said recent numbers show pressures could be easing."
605,The consumer price index declined 0.1% in December on a monthly basis and is up 6.4% from a year ago – down from the peak of 9% last summer but still well above where the Fed feels comfortable.
606,"Along with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the holdings in its bond portfolio."
607,"That has resulted in a reduction of about $445 billion since June, as the Fed has targeted a capped level of $95 billion in maturing bonds it is allowing to roll off each month rather than reinvest."
608,"The balance sheet reduction has been the equivalent of about 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes, according to the San Francisco Fed."
609,The balance sheet is still at more than $8.4 trillion.
610,Markets are watching for where the Fed will finally end the increases.
611,"At the December FOMC meeting, committee members indicated they see the ""terminal rate,"" or point where the Fed thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, as 5.1%."
612,"Markets are betting that number is closer to 4.75%, and they expect the Fed to start cutting rates later this year, after one more quarter-point increase in March."
613,Stocks rallied to start 2023 as investors anticipated a less restrictive Fed.
614,"After a roaring start to the year, digital assets look vulnerable to giving up some gains."
615,The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates will be a major catalyst.
616,Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were on pause Wednesday as traders awaited a key decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve.
617,"After the best January for Bitcoin in a decade, bad news out of the central bank has the potential to start February off on a sour note."
618,"The price of Bitcoin has risen less than 1% over the past 24 hours, hovering around $23,000."
619,"The largest digital asset has roared higher to start the year, gaining 40% as cryptos benefited from an improvement in investors’ appetite for risk."
620,"While Bitcoin remains at just a third of its late-2021 high, traders are increasingly optimistic that the bottom of a brutal bear market already has been hit—in the wake of the shock bankruptcy of FTX in November—and that cryptos are poised to march higher."
621,"Stocks and bonds are on an impressive run so far this year, driven by hopes the Federal Reserve will slow down, or even pause, its interest rate increases."
622,"Investors brace for decision day
 After last month’s stock run for the ages, market watchers will look closely at what the Fed does on Wednesday with interest rates, hoping that Jay Powell and his colleagues don’t pour cold water on the rally."
623,"Markets expect the Fed to raise the prime lending rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a new target range of 4.5 to 4.75 percent."
624,"That would mark “the first ‘normal’ sized hike since March 2022,” when the central bank began its big anti-inflation push, the Deutsche Bank analysts Jim Reid and Henry Allen wrote to investors this morning."
625,The big question is what comes down the line.
626,"Investors will parse the forthcoming announcement by the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee for signs of an approaching slowdown, or even pause, in interest rate increases."
627,"The key word is “ongoing” — as in, whether the committee still feels that “ongoing increases” in interest rates are necessary given signs in recent data that inflation is cooling."
628,"For investors, that data has been a signal to buy."
629,"The U.S.’s three major stock indexes rose on Tuesday, after stats showed that wages were moderating even as hiring remained strong."
630,"Tuesday’s data was enough to push the S&P 500 to a two-month high, as investors anticipated the Fed might ease up on rate increases."
631,"U.S. stock indexes opened lower on Wednesday as investors cautiously awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates later in the day, while chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed on an upbeat outlook."

641,"Washington CNN —
 Investors appear to be preparing for another match-up against their favorite sparring partners at the Federal Reserve today."
642,Fed officials are hoping they’ll be able to ease up on the pace of interest hikes without having to signal any immediate plans to stop.
643,"Wall Street, meanwhile, is convinced that the central bank will soon abandon its rate hike regimen."
644,"So will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has a way to go, or will the Fed show signs that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?"
645,"Tune in at around 2 p.m.
 What’s happening: Stocks have rallied this month, The S&P 500 just closed out its best January since 2019 (back when Corona was just a beer, not a virus) largely due to inflation data that encouraged investors to expect a pivot from the Fed."
646,"The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point, the smallest rate hike since last March, at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday."
647,Wall Street analysts also expect the Fed will stop hiking altogether by the spring.
648,Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation.
649,Defiant investors are counting on a pivot.
650,They may be in for a let down this week.
651,"“Investors seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of ‘Don’t Fight the Fed.’ Perhaps this week will serve as a reminder,” wrote Michael Wilson and a team of economists at Morgan Stanley in a recent note."
652,"Investors are looking for clarity on where rates are going but they’re unlikely to find it during the Fed policy announcement, said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US."
653,"“At the conclusion of this week’s FOMC meeting, we expect the Fed will leave the market hanging on the question of the future of rate hikes and how many we will see,” Donabedian wrote in a note."
654,“We expect the Fed to indicate they have more work to do.
655,"They will continue their stubbornness in fighting inflation, hesitant to declare victory just yet."
656,"This will leave the market hanging on the future of how many rate hikes we will see.”
 He’s preparing for a volatile market reaction."
657,"A final thought: Sick patients are often advised by their doctors to finish an entire course of antibiotics even if they feel better, because they risk relapsing or prolonging the illness if they don’t."
658,The same can be said of how the Federal Reserve handles the economy.
659,"Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working."
660,"But now, investors may be a bit too eager to end treatment, even as Fed officials warn that doing so would be premature."
661,"Stocks close out a jubilant January
 The greatest comebacks of all time: Rocky Balboa, JNCO jeans, Apple and now… the US stock market."
662,US stocks are off to a very strong start in 2023 following last year’s abysmal showing.
663,The Dow gained nearly 3% in January.
664,The S&P 500 rose 6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared almost 11%.
665,That’s the Nasdaq’s best month since July reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica.
666,The rally is largely built on hopes that inflation pressures are starting to abate.
667,That should allow the Fed to issue smaller rate increases — and possibly even pause them later this year.
668,"There’s a growing sense on Wall Street that the US economy may avoid a recession and instead wind up slowing to a so-called soft landing, a gradual slide in economic conditions that doesn’t lead to a massive spike in the unemployment rate or a major pullback in consumer spending."
669,The bottom line: There’s a strongly held belief amongst investors that stock performance in the first month of the year predicts performance for the rest of the year.
670,"That may be so, but the pace of the rally has left some investors skeptical about its sustainability, especially with a Fed policy decision, fourth quarter earnings reports from corporate titans and a jobs report ahead of us."
671,"US home prices continue to drop
 US home prices dropped for the fifth month in a row in November, reports my colleague Anna Bahney."
672,"Rising mortgage rates pushed prospective buyers out of the housing market late last year and prices continued to cool, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, released Tuesday."
673,"Last July marked the first month-over-month decrease for the national index since February 2012 and that continued through November, with seasonally adjusted prices falling 0.3% month over month."
674,"Still, inventory of available homes to buy remains the stubborn sticking point for many buyers."
675,Many current homeowners are hesitant to sell when they have very attractive rates under 4% and buying a new home would mean getting a much higher rate.
676,"“Home shoppers are still going to find limited supply in the market and affordability is still a major challenge, particularly for first-time homebuyers,” Lisa Sturtevant, Bright MLS chief economist said."
677,"“The persistent lack of inventory, exacerbated by this ‘rate lock,’ is the main reason why we should expect prices to be stable or even rise in the year ahead.”

 The expected increase would set the U.S. central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.50%-4.75% range, the highest since November 2007
 The U.S. Federal Reserve building, in Washington, on July 31, 2013.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, setting aside the rapid hikes used last year to curb a surge in inflation in favour of a more stepwise hunt for a stopping point."
723,"The expected increase would set the U.S. central bank’s benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.50 per cent-4.75 per cent range, the highest since November 2007, when the economy was on the eve of what would prove to be a long and deep recession."
724,"Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs."
725,The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).
726,Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later to elaborate on the decision.
727,"“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”
 Ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting this week, the International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for a global economy that its officials said had proved “surprisingly resilient” in the face of monetary policy tightening and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine."
728,"Caught flat-footed last year as inflation accelerated and threatened to prove far more persistent than anticipated, the Fed approved the fastest interest rate hikes since the 1980s."
729,"Starting with a quarter-percentage-point increase in March, the central bank by the summer was raising rates in increments of three quarters of a percentage point, and all told moved the target policy rate up by 4.25 percentage points in just 10 months."
730,It delivered a half-percentage-point hike at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.
731,The impact of the policy moves seems to be gaining steam.
732,"New data last week showed a key inflation measure slowed faster than expected in December, continuing a six-month downward trend."
733,"Growth in employment costs, closely watched as a possible indicator of future price increases, also slowed in the fourth quarter."
734,"But the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, still rose at a 5 per cent annual rate in December, down from a June high of nearly 7 per cent but still more than double the central bank’s 2 per cent inflation target."
735,Policy-makers are adamant they will not make what they consider to be the crucial error of pausing further rate hikes until they are convinced inflation is on a durable path back to the 2 per cent goal.
736,"Some analysts do expect the Fed to remove from its policy statement the current, open-ended promise of “ongoing increases” in interest rates, a phrase used since the central bank began its tightening cycle in March."
737,"Any new language, however, would still leave the door open for further increases depending on incoming economic data, particularly on inflation and jobs."
738,"The expected move to 25-basis-point rate increases will be a “hawkish downshift,” BNP Paribas economists wrote ahead of this week’s policy meeting."
739,"“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year."
740,"As of December, policy-makers’ median forecast was for the Fed’s target interest rate to peak in a range between 5.00 per cent and 5.25 per cent, an outlook that would imply a pause in the policy tightening after two more quarter-percentage-point increases."
741,"Traders of futures that settle to the Fed’s policy rate see the path somewhat differently, with the benchmark rate peaking in the 4.75 per cent-5.00 per cent range, and the central bank cutting that rate to around 4.4 per cent by December."
742,This week's Federal Reserve meeting will be remembered more for what policymakers say than what they do.
743,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference following the announcement that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2022."
744,"Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters
 This week's Federal Reserve meeting will be remembered more for what policymakers say than what they do."
745,"That's because markets have priced in a near-100% certainty — 98.9% to be exact, as of Tuesday afternoon — that the Federal Open Market Committee will announce a 0.25 percentage point interest rate increase when the two-day policy meeting wraps up Wednesday afternoon, according to CME Group data."
746,"While there's often strong market consensus heading into FOMC meetings, it's rarely this high."
747,What markets are unsure of is where the Fed goes from here.
748,"Traders are betting the central bank will hike a quarter point once more in March then stop, pause for several months, and then start cutting toward the end of the year."
749,"Conscious that the fight against inflation is far from over, despite some encouraging data lately, Chairman Jerome Powell could push back on the idea of a looser Fed so soon in the future."
750,Fed projections released in December indicate no cuts this year and continued rate hikes.
751,"""He is on a very tight monetary policy tightrope, where he can't allow the market to think this is the endgame,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial."
752,"""It's prudent for him to be careful."
753,It would be almost reckless for him to have the market believe that they're just about finished and inflation is where they want it.
754,"Inflation is certainly not where they want it."""
755,"With the careful communication path Powell must walk in mind, here's what to expect when the FOMC's post-meeting statement is released at 2 pm ET:
 Rates
 Over the past few weeks, Fed officials have been explicit in stating that, at the very least, they can start approving smaller moves than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases approved in 2022."
756,"That began in December with a 0.5-point move, and will continue with this highly anticipated move."
757,"That will take the fed funds rate to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007."
758,"The funds rate is what banks use as a benchmark for overnight borrowing, but it flows through to many consumer credit instruments like car loans, mortgages and credit cards."
759,"Though some Fed officials, such as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, have suggested the rate hike could be half a point, there's virtually no chance of that happening."
760,A quarter point is a lock.
761,"The statement
 For the most part, the post-meeting statement has changed little except for a few notable tweaks."
762,There is some speculation that the statement could get adjusted a bit more to add uncertainty of how much more aggressive the Fed wants to get.
763,"One key phrase that has been part of each statement since the hikes began in March 2022 is that committee members feel ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate."""
764,"That language could get softened, and it's likely the first place market participants will look for the Fed to tip its hand to acknowledge that the rate-hiking cycle is nearing an end."
765,"watch now
 There won't be any ""dot plot"" this meeting of individual members' rate expectations, nor will there be an update to the Summary of Economic Projections on GDP, unemployment and inflation."
766,So any hints about the future policy path will have to come first from the statement.
767,"""They'll likely do another 25 at the March meeting and that's when the cycle comes to end,"" Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a client note."
768,"""We see incredibly limited scope for the Fed to plausibly justify keeping this cycle going deeper into the year with what will already be a very restrictive policy stance in the face of what are likely mounting economic challenges to the backdrop."""
769,"Powell presser
 
 
 Brent crude futures dipped 11 cents to $85.35 a barrel at 0949 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 8 cents to $78.95
 Oil prices were broadly stable as the market is looking towards a meeting of OPEC and its allies as well as a Federal Reserve rate decision and U.S. government data on crude and fuel stockpiles on Wednesday."
770,"Brent crude futures dipped 11 cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $85.35 a barrel at 0949 GMT."
771,"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude futures rose 8 cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $78.95 a barrel."
772,"Tamer U.S. rate hike expectations helped lower the dollar index, which supported oil prices as a weaker greenback makes the commodity cheaper for buyers holding other currencies, according to Stephen Brennock, analyst at PVM."
773,The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver its decision at 1900 GMT.
774,"All eyes will be on a meeting of key ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, where producers are expected to stick with output targets agreed in November."
775,"OPEC’s oil output fell in January, as Iraqi exports dropped and Nigeria’s output did not recover, with the 10 OPEC members pumping 920,000 barrels per day (bpd) below their targeted volumes under the OPEC+ agreement, a Reuters survey found."
776,"The shortfall was bigger than the deficit of 780,000 bpd in December."
777,"Separately, data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group showed U.S. crude stocks rose about 6.3 million barrels, more than expected, in the week ended Jan. 27, according to market sources."
778,Government stockpile data is due at 1530 GMT.
779,"“Commercial storage in North America is ample,” said Norbert Ruecker, economist at the bank Julius Baer."
780,"“The improved market mood has lifted prices of late, but this support should remain temporary."
781,"We see lower prices longer term, in line with the futures market’s expectations.”
 WTI is trading in contango, which means front-month delivery contracts are trading higher than later deliveries, indicating current oversupply."
782,"Brent is in a shallow backwardation, the opposite market structure."
783,The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time in 11 months at the conclusion of its first monetary policy meeting of 2023 on Wednesday.
784,"New York CNN —
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time in 11 months at the conclusion of its first monetary policy meeting of 2023 on Wednesday."
785,But the meeting could also mark a pivotal turning point for the central bank’s decision making: a return to normal.
786,"The Fed is expected to slow the pace of rate hikes to a quarter percentage point, down from a half point in December."
787,"That would raise the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight borrowing to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007."
788,"It would also return the central bank to a more traditional, gentler pace of increases after a turbulent period of historically large hikes that upended markets, households and the economy."
789,"Now that inflation pressures have eased in recent months, consumer spending and hiring have slowed, and wage increases have moderated, many analysts believe the central bank could even stop raising rates — and possibly cut them later this year."
790,Others say it’s premature to assume a rate hike pause is on the horizon.
791,"Going the distance
 The key question facing Fed watchers this meeting is how the central bank will signal the path forward for the rest of the year."
792,"Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has “a ways to go,” or will Fed officials signal that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?"
793,"Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning."
794,"Consumer confidence data indicates uncertainty about the future, and recession fears have risen, especially among CEOs."
795,"That might sound like bad news, but it means that the Fed’s mission to cool the economy and stall price increases is working."
796,"In December, Powell outlined how he hopes to win his ongoing fight against inflation: Limit economic growth and rebalance the labor market, which he said would allow inflation to return to a growth rate of about 2%."
797,"Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target."
798,"The Consumer Price Index shows that while inflation continued to cool in the most recent reading, annual price growth is still at a historically high 6.5%."
799,"“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note."
800,Policymakers are unlikely to declare victory in their inflation fight just yet.
801,"“This first meeting of the year will no doubt be a very interesting one as it will set the tone for the rest of year,” wrote EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a recent note."
802,"“But, rather than a slow waltz, we anticipate an infernal tango as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.”
 The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m."
803,ET.
804,Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow the announcement with a press conference beginning at 2:30 p.m.
805,ET.
806,The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day Open Markets Committee meeting at 2 pm ET.

 Investors are becoming increasingly confident that major central banks will change course soon."
810,"They expect rates set by the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB to reach their peak by this spring."

828,"While Bitcoin remains at just a third of its late-2021 high, traders are increasingly optimistic that the bottom of a brutal bear market already has been hit—in the wake of the shock bankruptcy of FTX in November—and that cryptos are poised to march higher."

847,"During the prior fiscal year ended July 2, the company’s interest expenses totaled $58.7 million."
848,"Tapestry in May essentially swapped out the entire value of its $1.2 billion U.S. bond portfolio so that it could take advantage of wide differentials in rates between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, with about half going into euros and the other half into Japanese yen."
849,"Under the terms of the contracts, Tapestry makes semiannual interest payments of 2.4% and 2.7% in euros and 0.1% and minus 0.3% in Japanese yen."
850,"By comparison, the company’s most recent bond issuance in December 2021 carried a 3.05% coupon."

855,"For many U.S. companies, the combination of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates for much of last year created a lucrative scenario to enter into cross-currency swaps, said Bob Stark, global head of market strategy at Kyriba, a treasury management software provider."
856,"Swaps can also provide finance chiefs at global companies more predictability in their cash flows by protecting them from currency volatility, Mr. Stark said."
857,The value of the dollar last year strengthened against other currencies as a result of the Fed’s aggressive steps to tackle inflation.
858,"Demand for cross-currency swaps, while elevated in 2022, has been robust since a hedge accounting rule was adopted in 2017 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, bankers and advisers said."
859,That rule made it easier for companies to use cross-currency swaps and recognize the interest savings on their financial statements.
