“The bigger uncertainty may be around how the dots shift and whether Powell continues to distance himself from them. I think the median dot will bring forward 50bps of hikes into 2022 which shouldn’t spook fed funds futures pricing that’s already there with about 2½ 25bps hikes priced by the end of 2022.
“Fewer hikes and/or Powell’s distancing himself from the dots again could come across dovishly. More of a shift in the dots toward 3-4 hikes could be more hawkish and toward our 100bps forecast for hikes in 2022.”

1,US Federal Reserve expected to speed up end of pandemic support,2021-12-15T17:27:53Z,"Central bank likely to double rate at which it cuts spending on government bonds, in shift that could herald interest rate rises","The US Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate an end to the central bank’s pandemic-era support of the US economy on Wednesday night, in a major shift that could herald a series of interest rate rises next year.
The expected measures are a signal that US central bankers no longer view rising inflation as a “transitory” nuisance caused by supply chain problems meeting pent-up consumer demand, but an issue that now requires firm management to avert lasting damage to the US economy.
At the end of a two-day meeting in Washington, the Fed is anticipated to announce it will reduce its monthly $120bn (£90bn) spending on government bonds designed to lower long-term interest rates at twice the rate that chairman, Jerome Powell, outlined just six weeks ago.
Officials are also expected to forecast that they will raise short-term rates that have been set at near-zero for close to two years. A forecast for a series of rate rises next year is, again, a departure from indications offered by central bankers just three months ago when the Fed forecast one rate increase in 2022.
Central bankers in many of the world’s major economies are attempting a delicate tightrope walk: raise rates enough to tamp down inflation, but not so much as as to crush businesses, already struggling to meet rising wages and materials costs, with higher borrowing costs, including for mortgages, credit cards and loans.
Efforts to curb inflation, which reached 6.8% in November, the highest in 39 years, come amid signs that consumers are beginning to tap into savings to meet the cost of living. Producer prices increased more than expected in the year to November, registering their largest gains in a decade, while retail sales gains slowed last month to 0.3% from an increase of 1.8% in October.
“With prices rising sharply last month, the muted 0.3% m/m rise in retail sales values suggests that consumption was little changed in real terms,” noted Andrew Hunter at Capital Economics. “That won’t stop the Fed from accelerating the pace of its QE taper later today, but it supports our view that economic growth is likely to slow next year.”
Economists believe that many consumers, liberated from Delta-variant lockdowns, have been spending enthusiastically before the Christmas season to avoid shortages.
But despite the slowdown in spending gains, consumer demand is well above last year’s levels, with retail sales – the largest driver of the US economic activity – rising 18.2% in November from a year earlier.
“It’s very possible that people are taking a bit of an advantage or changing lanes because they are afraid of bad news coming from the Fed,” Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told Reuters.
“But on the other hand, if the market were really afraid of bad news, the futures should have moved a lot more. So, this is not really a market that is speaking its voice, not yet.”
With higher interest rates forecast – economists polled by Reuters predict rate rises of 0.25-0.50% in the third quarter of 2022, followed by another in the fourth – economists say that consumers may be spending before belt-tightening as pandemic support cheques end and the cost of credit increases.
At the same time, record wage increases of 4.2% to September over a year earlier have not kept pace with official inflation figures. In reality, the rising costs of fuel, housing, transport and food have pushed the costs of living higher and faster than official numbers reveal.
Before Powell’s highly anticipated press conference at 1900 GMT, US energy prices fell further on fears of weakening demand due to fallout from the Omicron coronavirus variant and the reintroduction of containment measures.
“With disposable incomes now falling in real terms, as fiscal support fades and surging prices take their toll, and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant likely to exert at least some drag on high-contact services activity, real consumption growth looks set for much slower growth over the months ahead,” predicted Hunter.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/15/us-federal-reserve-expected-to-speed-up-end-of-pandemic-support

3,The Fed hints at multiple rate hikes in 2022 to combat inflation,2021-12-15T16:00:00Z,America's inflation spikes have prompted the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace in normalizing its pandemic-era monetary policy.,"(CNN) — America's inflation spikes have prompted the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace in normalizing its pandemic-era monetary policy.
On Wednesday, the central bank said it will wrap up its stimulus program faster than originally announced, and its updated economic projections show multiple interest rate increases in 2022.
The central bank, which first announced in November that it was ""tapering"" its monthly asset purchases, said Wednesday that it will do so at a quicker pace.
Starting in January, the Fed will cut its monthly purchases of Treasury securities by $20 billion and cut its monthly mortage-backed securities buys by $10 billion. That leaves the purchases at $40 billion for Treasury securities and $20 billion for mortgage-backed securities each month.
That's consistent with what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress in late November.
At this pace, the Fed is another two meetings away from completing the wind down of the stimulus, Powell told reporters during Wednesday's press conference. The Fed's next two meetings will be in January and March.
But the central bank also reserves the right to change the pace of monthly purchases again if the economic outlook demands it, Wednesday's statement said.
Rate hikes are coming
The December policy update also included a summary of economic projections, the so-called ""dot plot.""
Fed officials now predict the central bank's benchmark interest rate to rise to 0.9% in 2022, up from the 0.3% expectation from September, signaling additional interest hikes.
To investors and market watchers, this suggests there will be three rate hikes next year. So far, market expectations for an interest rate increase are really picking up in May, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Any rate increases will likely be gradual, Powell told reporters during Wednesday's press conference.
And at this point, potential economic fallout from the spread of the Omicron variant hasn't yet changed the Fed's view.
Once rates are raised, the next challenge for the Fed will be reducing its enormous balance sheet. ""We had our first discussion about the balance sheet,"" at this month's meeting, Powell said, even if any action in that regard is still far off.
But inflation might stick around, too
US inflation has still not come down from its highs. Last week's consumer price inflation report showed prices have risen to a 39-year high over the 12-month period ended in November. (CPI isn't the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, though; the price index tracking personal consumption expenditure is.)
Powell acknowledged that there's a real risk that the pandemic-era inflation will stick around for longer than initially expected.
""One of the reason the behind our move today is to put us in a position,"" to deal with inflation, Powell said.
He added that the Fed wasn't behind the curve in responding to the price spikes: It adjusted its policy immediately when it became clear that higher prices were going to stick around.
""In September -- I'd say after Labor Day -- it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent,"" Powell said.
The Fed got the Employment Cost Index on the Friday before the November meeting, which was ""a very high reading,"" he added, and the employment report two days after the meeting was very strong and showed no increase in labor, he said.
""And I honestly at that point really decided, I thought we needed to look at speeding up the taper.""

Policymakers will likely point to higher inflationary prints to justify a speedier ""taper"" of its asset purchase program.

The Federal Reserve provided multiple indications Wednesday that its run of ultra-easy policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is coming to a close, making aggressive policy moves in response to rising inflation.
For one, the central bank said it will accelerate the reduction of its monthly bond purchases.
The Fed will be buying $60 billion of bonds each month starting in January, half the level prior to the November taper and $30 billion less than it had been buying in December. The Fed was tapering by $15 billion a month in November, doubled that in December, then will accelerate the reduction further come 2022.
After that wraps up, in late winter or early spring, the central bank expects to start raising interest rates, which were held steady at this week's meeting.
Projections released Wednesday indicate that Fed officials see as many as three rate hikes coming in 2022, with two in the following year and two more in 2024.
""Economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy,"" Chairman Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference.
The Federal Open Market Committee's moves, approved unanimously, represent a substantial adjustment to policy that has been the loosest in its 108-year history. The post-meeting statement noted the impact from inflation.
""Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation,"" the statement said.
The committee sharply ratcheted up its inflation outlook for 2021, pushing it to 5.3% from 4.2% for all items and to 4.4% from 3.7% excluding food and energy. For 2022, the expectation is now 2.6% for headline and 2.7% for core, both up from September.
At the same time, the unemployment rate projection for 2021 came down to 4.3% from 4.8% in September.
The statement noted that ""job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment
rate has declined substantially.""
However, members came out on the hawkish side of policy moves, with members solidly leaning toward rate hikes. The ""dot plot"" of individual members rate expectations indicated that just six of the 18 FOMC members saw fewer than three increases next year, and no members saw rates staying where they are now, anchored near zero.
That vote came even as the statement reaffirmed that the Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate would stay near zero ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment.""
The committee reduced its forecast for economic growth this year, seeing GDP rising 5.5% for 2021, compared with the 5.9% indicated in September. Officials also revised their forecasts in subsequent year, raising 2022 growth to 4% from 3.8% and lowering 2023 to 2.2% from 2.5%.
The statement again noted that developments with the Covid pandemic, in particular with variants, pose risks to the outlook.
Inflation hotter than expected
Both policy moves came in response to escalating inflation, which is running at its highest level in 39 years for consumer prices. Wholesale prices in November jumped 9.6%, the fastest on record in a sign that inflation pressures are becoming more ingrained and broad based.
Fed officials long have stressed that inflation is ""transitory,"" which Powell has defined as unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy. He and other central bank leaders, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have stressed that prices are booming due to pandemic-related factors such as extraordinary demand that has outstripped supply but ultimately will fade.
However, the term had become a pejorative and the post-meeting statement eliminated it. Powell telegraphed the move during congressional testimony last month, saying ""it's probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.""
For the Powell Fed, tightening policy now marks a dramatic pivot off a policy enacted just over a year ago. Known as ""flexible average inflation targeting,"" which meant it would be content with inflation a little above or below its long-held 2% target.
The policy's practical application was that the Fed was willing to let inflation run a little hot in the interest of completely healing the labor market from the hit it took during the pandemic. The Fed's new policy sought employment that was both full and inclusive across racial, gender and economic lines. Officials agreed not to raise interest rates in anticipation of increasing inflation, as the central bank had done in the past.
However, as the ""transitory"" narrative came into question and inflation began to look stronger and more durable, the Fed has had to rethink its intentions and shift gears.
The asset purchase taper began in November, with a reduction of $10 billion in Treasury purchases and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. That still left the month buys at $70 billion and $35 billion, respectively.
However, the Fed's $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 billion and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion. Over the past 12 months, Treasury holdings have expanded by $978 billion while MBS has risen by $567 billion.
Under the new terms of a program also known as quantitative easing, the Fed would accelerate the decline of its holdings until it is no longer adding to its portfolio. That would bring QE to an end in the spring and allow the central bank to raise rates anytime after. The Fed has said it likely would not hike rates and continue buying bonds simultaneously, as the two moves would work at cross purposes.
From there, the Fed at anytime could start reducing its balance sheet either by selling securities outright, or, in the more likely scenario, begin allowing the proceeds of its current bond holdings to run off each month at a controlled pace.

Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Amid rising inflation, some analysts expect the Federal Reserve to end their policy meeting Wednesday by clearing the way for its first interest rate hike in more than three years. The Fed appears poised to announce that it's accelerating the end of its emergency bond-buying program by a few months. Economists say the move would be a precursor to a rate hike sometime in 2022.

The Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. It will announce the result of the meeting at 2 p.m. EST Wednesday.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and analysts have said rising U.S. inflation is ""transitory"" and they expect it to dissipate as the economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19. Continued supply chain shortages, they said, has been a factor in part in keeping inflation high.

""I think getting out of the easing business is very much overdue,"" Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Black Rock, told CNBC.
""I think the data will determine when they are going to start. I don't think the Fed has any notion that they have to start at any given quarter.""

The Fed began the emergency bond program in March 2020 immediately after the pandemic began. It's scheduled to end in June, but many analysts expect the Fed on Wednesday to announce a new end date in March.
The move would clear the way for the Federal Reserve to raise key interest rates, from near zero, early next year. The last time the Fed increased rates was December 2018.
David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said if the Fed decides to make a rate change or tighten monetary policy, it will likely be a measured move.
""Fed members have displayed their dovish feathers too often at this stage for us to mistake them for a flock of hawks,"" Kelly told MarketWatch.

Despite a slight rebound, the euro exchange rate remains clearly above the level of PLN 4.60. This means that the Polish zloty remains very weak. The market’s attention will focus today on the evening statement from the Federal Reserve.
On Wednesday at 10:26 the euro was traded at PLN 4.6231, which is similar to yesterday evening. The day before, the EUR / PLN exchange rate returned from the highest level in two weeks after it rose quite quickly from PLN 4.58 to PLN 4.6454 in the previous days.
– The zloty quite efficiently reached the level of 4.64 per EUR, which, in our opinion, exhausted the potential for weakening resulting from, inter alia, the delayed approval of the National Reconstruction Plan by the European Commission – assessed Bank Millennium analysts.
Today, however, the most important thing will be the statement from the US central bank, which will be announced at 20:00 Polish time. There is a possibility that under the influence of very high inflation and an overheated labor market, the Fed will accelerate the decommissioning of its bond purchase (QE) program, under which it “prints” over one hundred billion dollars a month. Such information would be potentially unfavorable for emerging market currencies, including the zloty.
For now, however, the main currency pair is calm. The EUR / USD exchange rate has been close to the lowest levels since July 2020 since the beginning of December. A strong dollar harms the zloty to a similar extent as domestic factors (high inflation, delayed reaction of the MPC, dispute between the government and the European Commission). As a result, the dollar in the Polish market was approaching PLN 4.10 on Wednesday morning.
Tomorrow, the Swiss National Bank will decide on the interest rates. The exchange rate of the franc against the euro has remained close to the strongest levels since July 2015. As a result, the Helvetic currency costs PLN 4.4376 this morning, which is less than PLN 0.10 below the November all-time record.

10,Is the Federal Reserve blowing its best chance to fight inflation?,2021-12-15T13:11:11Z,"The Federal Reserve, faced with the highest jump in inflation in almost four decades, is preparing to pivot.","A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter.

London (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve, faced with the highest jump in inflation in almost four decades , is preparing to pivot.
What's happening: Gone are the days when Chair Jerome Powell said inflation was ""transitory."" When the Fed wraps up its final meeting of the year on Wednesday, it's expected to announce that it will wind down its emergency bond-buying program faster than expected as it tries to curb rising prices.
The central bank will also send a message to investors about how soon it expects to start raising interest rates from rock-bottom levels.
But some economists and executives are alarmed by what they're seeing.
They worry that without decisive action soon, the Fed will miss its opportunity to keep a lid on inflation, which is notoriously tricky to manage once it starts accelerating.
""Two things happen when inflation gets embedded,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" earlier this week. ""One, you lose purchasing power, and the poor suffer the most. Second, you get a Fed overreaction, and then you get a recession, and then you get income losses. So, you really want to navigate this process in a timely and orderly way.""
He thinks the Fed shouldn't wait until it stops buying bonds to think about interest rate hikes, as it has previously indicated it would do. That conversation needs to start ""now.""
Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, also believes the Fed should ""probably be more worried about these higher prices.""
""The Fed must act now to help prevent faster inflation from scuttling the US economic expansion and eroding consumers' purchasing power,"" Peterson wrote in a column for CNN Business on Monday . ""That means it should accelerate the pace of its quantitative easing taper, and raise interest rates a few times next year.""
Remember: The Fed hasn't wanted to pull back support for the economy at a pace that could derail the jobs recovery. Yet Peterson writes that ""incoming labor market data suggest that the economy has achieved or will soon reach full employment, but inflation is still out of control.""
In June, the Fed predicted that its preferred measure of inflation would run at 3.4% in 2021, already well above its target of roughly 2%. The latest data from October showed inflation at 5%. November could be even worse.
Even if the Fed does start to move more aggressively, there are questions about how effective interest rate hikes would be in the current environment. Boosting rates could help cool the red-hot housing market, but won't do much to directly address supply chain problems and labor shortages, which are major reasons prices have climbed over the past year.
That bolsters the case for caution at the central bank.
""Three main factors have driven inflation over the past year: fiscal stimulus, tight labor markets, and supply-chain problems,"" Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork, recently wrote in The Atlantic . ""All three of these will dissipate over the next year or two. What is required, then, is not prudence but patience.""
Still, investors expect more members of the Fed to get behind rate hikes on Wednesday. The central bank's ""dot plot,"" which charts interest rate expectations, will be scrutinized.
""I would be very surprised if there aren't more dots talking about rate increases next year,"" Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday.
Wall Street's mood: Gorman thinks that when rates start to rise, financial markets ""may have a setback for a little bit."" But he thinks that's ""fine.""
""The Fed's job is not to worry about the market,"" he said. ""It's to worry about the economy.""
Pfizer's stock surge is bigger than its vaccine
Pfizer PFE Shares ofhave skyrocketed more than 50% this year, significantly outpacing the 23% rise in the S&P 500 index.
The company's Covid-19 vaccine has been a huge part of the story.
See here: On its most recent earnings call, the company said it expected sales of its coronavirus vaccine to reach $36 billion this year.
The scramble for booster shots as wealthy countries try to keep the Omicron variant at bay could provide another lift. But it's not the only development investors are monitoring.
This just in: Pfizer announced Tuesday that its experimental treatment for Covid-19 cut the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% if given to high-risk adults within a few days of their first symptoms, according to its latest clinical trial.
In an interview with CBS, CEO Albert Bourla said that the pill, which is called ""Paxlovid,"" could be available in the United States this month, pending emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.
While it's not a replacement for vaccines, it could be a ""game changer,"" he emphasized.
President Joe Biden praised Pfizer's report, which he said could ""mark a significant step forward in our path out of the pandemic."" His administration ""has already placed an order for enough of these pills to treat 10 million Americans,"" he added.
Watch this space: UBS upgraded its rating for Pfizer's stock from ""neutral"" to ""buy"" earlier this week. Driving the move? An estimated $14 billion in sales from Paxlovid in 2022.
Surprise! Holiday packages are moving on time
Here's a rare piece of holiday cheer in a year of screwed-up supply chains: Shipments and deliveries are moving fairly well
Deliveries of packages by UPS, FedEx and the US Postal Service are all moving at close to 100% on-time performance, according to data from ShipMatrix, a software provider that works with parcel shippers. It's a pleasant surprise, even for those who anticipated that those services would be well prepared for the holiday season, my CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports.
""If you operate at the peak, that's tremendous,"" said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix. ""I was expecting [the performance rate] to be in the mid-90s.""
Jindel attributes the better-than-expected results to three factors: 1) carriers, foreseeing problems, added capacity, 2) more consumers are buying in stores, and 3) people knew there were supply chain problems and shopped early.
A survey conducted for UPS earlier this year found that 91% of consumers planned to complete their holiday shopping one week before Christmas compared to 81% last year. And about 60% of consumers aimed to finish shopping two weeks before the holiday, up from 52% in 2020.
There's more: Shipping companies are actually moving more boxes. FedEx said it expects to handle 100,000 more packages this holiday season than it did in 2019. UPS is forecasting a volume increase from last year's record levels. That makes it even more impressive that everything is moving smoothly.

Data released last week found that consumer inflation hit a four-decade high, and the Department of Labor reported Tuesday that wholesale prices jumped at a record rate of 9.6 percent from a year ago.
“I think it’s the impact on the broader population that’s really the Fed’s challenge,” said Stephen Lee, principal of Logan Capital Management.
In recent comments, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was renominated last month to lead the Fed for another four years, has retreated from describing price increases as “transitory.” There is widespread expectation that he will use his Wednesday afternoon press conference to announce that the Fed will wrap up its pandemic-era bond-buying program more quickly than it initially planned.

“I’m expecting a substantially more hawkish tone heading into Wednesday,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager and analyst at Aptus Capital Advisors. “Inflation is real right now.”
For the past year and a half, the Fed has bought $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, part of a strategy to stabilize the financial system when it was feared that global shutdowns resulting from Covid-19 could trigger an economic collapse. The Fed initially advanced a six-month timeframe for the wind-down, but there are indications that it might adopt a faster pace, possibly concluding in March rather than in June.
A speedier wind-down likely points to earlier rate hikes, action on which market expectations have changed considerably in recent months: As recently as March, the Fed wasn’t expected to raise its benchmark rate from its current near-zero level until 2024. Now, those same projections call for as many as three quarter-percent rate hikes in 2022 alone, implying a Fed funds rate of between 0.75 and 1 percent.
Current projections call for as many as three rate hikes in 2022.
“I think the markets are predicting that the Fed’s hands will be forced to raise rates earlier and faster than previously expected,” said Dan North, senior economist at Euler Hermes North America.
“This is just a reaction from the Fed as they’ve seen this trade off between growth and inflation worsen. They’re forced into difficult decisions,” said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Abrdn, because of the unique distortions the pandemic has imposed on the economy.
Policymakers have offset previous macroeconomic shocks in the past by increasing the money supply and adopting more accommodative positions, but that playbook isn’t a go-to this time around. The Fed can’t do anything about factory shutdowns in Asia or container ships queued up off the coast of California, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
“A lot of the inflationary pressures are on the supply side of the equation, which the Fed can’t do much about,” he said.
Dysfunction in D.C. also doesn’t help. “You’ve got policy uncertainty as well as Covid uncertainty. It really makes the Fed’s job a little more challenging,” Lee said, pointing to the ongoing wrangling in Washington.
Some lawmakers, primarily but not exclusively Republicans, have criticized President Biden’s Build Back Better economic agenda, saying that the roughly $1.7 trillion package would contribute to inflation by pouring more money into an economy that already shows signs of overheating and as well as putting more pressure on already-strained supply chains, which could exacerbate the climbing costs for a growing list of goods and services.
Different studies have produced a variety of conclusions, and analysts likewise are split on the likely impact — particularly given the uncertainty around the extent and duration of supply-chain issues moving into the new year.
Ethan Harris, head of global economics research for Bank of America, warned in a new report that adding demand in an economy already facing tight supplies of both materials and labor could drive prices up further. “In our opinion, the proposed increases in investment would stimulate demand more than supply in the short run, creating inflationary risks,” he wrote, although he noted that the ultimate impact could differ depending on what the final legislation includes.
Harris also called the Build Back Better Act “quite progressive in the short run,” though. He noted that lower-income families would benefit from multiple new tax credits — which would achieve a key goal of the platform advanced by Biden’s economic team.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/fed-set-accelerate-tightening-rate-hikes-waiting-wings-rcna8831

But price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, not the White House. And prices are anything but stable right now.","New York (CNN Business) President Joe Biden is taking the political punches for high inflation. But price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, not the White House. And prices are anything but stable right now.
The good news is that the Federal Reserve knows how to fight inflation : By tapping the brakes on the economy. The bad news is the harder it hits the brakes, the greater the risk of an accident that ends the economic recovery, freaks out financial markets -- or both.
""The Fed knows what to do, but they don't necessarily know how to do it without squashing the economy,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told CNN.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, fresh off his renomination by Biden, will attempt to assure Wall Street, Washington and the public at large on Wednesday there's no reason to panic about sticker shock.
Powell must promise to get inflation under control -- but do so without removing support so quickly that the recovery stalls out. It's a difficult needle to thread.
""Pressures on the Fed now are intensifying and enormous,"" David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, told CNN in an email.
'He's got to fall on his sword'
Powell's task is complicated by how wrong the Fed and the consensus among economists has been. Very few people expected inflation at the end of 2021 to be this hot for this long.
Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, told CBS the Fed's characterization of inflation as transitory ""is probably the worst inflation call in the history of the Federal Reserve.""
""Powell needs to eat his words. He's got to fall on his sword. Inflation is no longer transitory,"" said Shalett.
New numbers out on Tuesday showed that producer prices, those charged by suppliers to businesses, spiked by 9.6% from a year ago. That's the highest on record since the government started tracking this metric in 2010.
""These are provocative numbers, by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Shalett, who added she's more concerned about inflation today than at any point during her three-decade career on Wall Street.
Negative feedback loop
Biden has acknowledged that high inflation is squeezing families. But he's also argued that inflation is peaking now.
That may very well be the case. Many economists do think inflation will cool off in 2022 and that the price spike may be at or near a peak. But it's very hard to accurately forecast anything in the Covid economy. And even if the worst of inflation is over soon, that doesn't mean prices will automatically revert back to healthy levels.
Inflation was very tame in the aftermath of the Great Recession. For years, the Fed fretted that inflation was too low. Falling prices are scary for central bankers because it's very difficult to escape a deflationary spiral.
But Covid has changed that. Supply chain bottlenecks, worker shortages and surging demand as the world recovers from the pandemic have set off a bout of inflation. Consumer prices are up by 5% or more during each of the past six months. That's nowhere near the Fed's goal for roughly 2% inflation.
""The more persistent it is, the more likely it becomes embedded in the economy. That's what is troubling in the recent inflation prints,"" Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America, told CNN.
If everyone starts to anticipate higher prices, they will change their behavior. Workers will demand higher and higher wages. Consumers will pull forward their purchases. And all of that will add further pressure on inflation. It becomes a negative feedback loop.
""It starts to enter the psychology of the economy,"" said Harris.
How the Fed can fight inflation
Unlike deflation, the Fed knows it can address inflation by raising the cost of money.
In this case, that means unwinding the Fed's bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, or QE. Despite the booming economy and red-hot inflation, up until very recently the Fed was buying a staggering $120 billion of mortgage and Treasury bonds a month.
But that program is only piling pressure on inflation and Powell has signaled a willingness to speed up the demise of QE. Look for the Fed to endorse a faster ""taper"" of QE on Wednesday.
And Fed officials will likely signal that interest rates will have to rise off rock-bottom levels to combat inflation. Wall Street is pricing in at least two interest rate hikes next year, a big reversal from earlier this year when many assumed the Fed could stay at zero until 2023.
Current Fed policy (zero rates and massive QE) is ""insane"" given inflationary pressures and the strength of the underlying economy, Shalett said.
The Volcker playbook
Paul Volcker, the legendary former chairman of the Fed, tamed the runaway inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s by dramatically raising interest rates.
While Volcker's success earned him a place in the history books, what often gets overlooked today is the economic pain those rate hikes inflicted on the economy. Under Volcker, interest rates skyrocketed to an unprecedented 20%, crushing the economy by raising the cost of everything from mortgages, small business loans and car loans.
""Everyone talks about Paul Volcker as a hero. But the United States economy was in a double-dip recession between 1981 and 1984,"" said Shalett. ""Everyone has said this is not the 1970s. But I don't know that we know that for sure.""
Curiously, the bond markets are not freaking out about the high inflation readings. The 10-year Treasury rate stands at about 1.45% today, down from 1.7% in mid-October.
Kotok, the Cumberland Advisors chairman, said the bond market is more concerned about the Fed overreacting to today's hot inflation readings than it is about the hot inflation readings themselves.
And Kotok shares that concern.
""I fear a policy error that goes too far, too fast and throws the US economy into a slowdown or recession,"" Kotok said. ""History suggests that is a very real possibility.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/15/economy/inflation-fed-meeting/index.html

Federal Reserve officials are shifting their focus away from bolstering the economic recovery and toward trying to guard against out-of-control inflation, and on Wednesday they are expected to announce they are hastening plans to cut their policy help.
Policymakers are wrapping up their final gathering of 2021, and are widely expected to signal a faster end to the bond-buying campaign they have used to keep money flowing through financial markets and support the economy since the early days of the pandemic. They could also telegraph that they expect to raise rates from rock-bottom more rapidly than they projected just a few months ago.
The potential for major policy signals at the Fed’s meeting, which concludes at 2 p.m. Wednesday, will make it one of the most closely watched of the pandemic era.
Officials took their first step toward weaning the economy off the central bank’s support in November, when they said they would begin to slow a large-scale bond-buying program that had been in place since early in the pandemic to keep money flowing around markets and support the economy. In the weeks since the Fed’s last meeting, fresh data has showed that consumer prices are climbing rapidly and the unemployment rate is falling swiftly as the economy heals.
Given inflation and growth trends, Fed officials made clear ahead of their December meeting that they planned to discuss withdrawing support more quickly, and economists think officials will on Wednesday signal a plan to taper off bond purchases so that the buying will stop altogether in March.
Wall Street investors will also eagerly watch both the Fed’s quarterly economic projections and the post-meeting news conference by the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for any hint at when and how rapidly policymakers expect to lift interest rates away from near-zero, where they have been set since March 2020. Here’s what to watch in the announcement. Quicker end to bond buying: Economists expect that the Fed will speed up its retreat from its bond-buying program, doubling the monthly slowdown in purchases by $15 billion, so that the central bank is buying $30 billion less each month. That would mean that the purchases would end altogether ahead of the central bank’s March meeting.
Interest rate projections: Several Fed officials have signaled that they would prefer to wait until the bond-buying program ends to lift interest rates, their more traditional and powerful tool for cooling off the economy. By gearing up to stop bond buying sooner, the Fed could put itself in a position to raise interest rates earlier, should officials decide that higher rates are necessary to cool off consumer demand and weigh down inflation. Policymakers could also offer hints about when rate increases might start and how quickly they will proceed in their so-called dot plot, which shows officials’ anonymous projections of where interest rates will be set in coming years. Many economists expect the plot to show two to three increases in 2022.
Powell’s stance: The Fed chair signaled late last month that the central bank was shifting toward a more wary stance when it comes to inflation. But those comments were made before fresh data was released, including last week’s report that showed consumer prices rising at the fastest pace since 1982. Producer prices are climbing briskly and the labor market continues to recover, and Mr. Powell’s interpretation of those metrics will be closely watched. So, too, will any hint about what it all means for interest rates down the road.
Meeting the full employment test: One big question lingering on the Fed’s horizon is what full employment might look like in 2022. After months of stagnation, pandemic-depressed labor force participation showed signs of picking up in November. If officials want to see more recovery, it could mean that reaching maximum employment will take longer as sidelined workers slowly trickle back. If, on the other hand, they just want to see a lower unemployment rate, that trend is well in train. Joblessness is already down to 4.2 percent, compared with a peak of 14.8 percent early in the pandemic. The Fed has said that it wants to see inflation above 2 percent on a sustained basis — a goal officials have suggested has been more than achieved — and maximum employment before raising rates. With one target met, the second one is the factor to watch.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 oscillated between small gains and losses, pointing to the broad-market index hovering after it closed down 0.8% Tuesday. It has retreated 1.7% this week. Nasdaq-100 futures and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were also little changed.
Investors are awaiting an update from the Fed at 2 p.m. ET, followed by a media conference, that will signal whether the central bank will act more forcefully to temper inflation.
“What’s really coming in context is that inflation is hotter for longer than expected and the Fed is acknowledging it,” said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank. “There’s also the view that new variants are not just a concern for growth, but a concern for inflation.”
U.S. consumer prices hit a 39-year high Friday and producer prices notched a record this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recently that the central bank is prepared to accelerate tapering, clearing the way to hike interest rates next year, despite the risks to economic growth posed by the Omicron variant.
Oil prices fell Wednesday, with global benchmark Brent crude declining 1.1% to $72.95 a barrel, as expectations of a faster pullback in Fed stimulus weighed on prices. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday it had reduced its forecast for 2022 energy demand, due to Omicron, and also cut its supply outlook.
Studies indicate Omicron is more resistant to vaccines than previous variants.
This comes as more information is emerging about the Omicron variant. The first large real-world study showed that the efficacy of two Pfizer shots declined against the strain, both for infection and hospitalization. The variant currently accounts for about 3% of cases in the U.S.
“Companies and consumers have become very good at adapting to these variants,” Ms. Dwek said. The key risk is supply-chain disruptions lasting longer than expected because of China’s zero Covid policy, she added.

The Fed is set to wrap up its two-day December policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon, with Chairman Jerome Powell due to hold a press conference afterwards at 2:30 a.m. ET. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce that it will speed up the tapering of its bond-buying program, as inflation continues to rise. The producer price index, which is one measure of inflation, saw a hotter-than-expected November reading on Tuesday. The PPI showed a year-on-year increase of 9.6%, which was the fastest pace on record and higher than the 9.2% increase forecast by economists. A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would roughly end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
Greg Williamson, head of strategy at Pluribus Labs, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday that the Fed had a ""very tight line to walk"" with what it said after the meeting. ""It needs to convince the markets that it's earnest in fighting inflation but it can't confuse or disrupt the markets so much with inflation concerns that it leads the economy or the markets down,"" he explained. Williamson also believed the Fed would increase its tapering of asset purchases by a further $15 billion, taking the monthly total to $30 billion. He expected the Fed could, therefore, finish its tapering process by June next year, which is when the central bank officials' ""dot plots"" indicate that it could be time to start raising interest rates.

16,FOREX-Dollar steady as markets wait for Fed,2021-12-15T09:11:39Z,The dollar held firm on Wednesday as investors waited to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve would reinforce market expectations for rate hikes next year. The Fed's policy statement and economic projections will come at 1900 GMT.,"The dollar held firm on Wednesday as investors waited to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve would reinforce market expectations for rate hikes next year.
The Fed's policy statement and economic projections will come at 1900 GMT. Markets have been pricing for the Fed to end its bond-buying around March and then proceed with one or maybe two rate hikes in 2022. Anything more than two rate hikes pencilled in for next year would be considered a hawkish surprise.
The Fed meeting comes as the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is causing concern that the economic recovery will be derailed. But the expectation of Fed hawkishness has kept the dollar strong in recent weeks - it has seen little movement since it hit 96.938 last month, its highest since July 2020.
""We can't recall going into an FOMC meeting with the consensus so strongly favouring a hawkish outcome,"" wrote MUFG head of research Derek Halpenny in a note to clients. ""(Fed chairman Jerome) Powell may emphasise the uncertainty of the guidance to such an extent this evening that it dampens the response... The scope for a big move for the US dollar this evening may be limited.""
The dollar's moves were muted as investors awaited the meeting. It held firm in the Asian session, then slipped slightly as European markets opened, down 0.1% at 96.445. Versus the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.1% at 113.7 .
Elsa Lignos, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a client note that if the Fed did not emphasise the gap between ending asset purchases and raising rates, or if markets repriced to expect a higher terminal rate, then that would be a positive surprise for the dollar. Currency markets were little affected overnight by mixed economic data from China, which showed that factory output grew faster than expected but retail sales missed forecasts.
The euro was up 0.1% at $1.127 ahead of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, where officials are expected to confirm that the bank's pandemic bond-buying programme will end next March. Britain's pound briefly rose against the dollar after data showing that UK inflation jumped to its highest in more than 10 years in November.
At 0853 GMT, it was up 0.4% on the day at $1.3278. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it meets on Thursday, due to the spread of the Omicron variant in Britain.
The Australian dollar was up 0.4% at $0.71335. The New Zealand dollar was up 0.2% at $0.6756. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency bitcoin was little changed at $48,509.9 - a far cry from its latest all-time high of $69,000 which was reached in early November.
U.S. retail sales are also due later in the session.

A second omicron case was reported confirmed in China on Wednesday, underscoring the persisting threat from infections as new coronavirus variants emerge.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 index fell 0.7% to 4,634.09. It set an all-time high on Friday, when it closed out its biggest weekly gain since February. The index is up 23.4% so far this year.

Businesses have been dealing with supply chain problems and higher costs for months and are passing those costs to consumers, who have so far been absorbing higher prices on everything from groceries to clothing and other consumer products. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices surged 6.8% for the 12 months ending in November, the biggest increase in 39 years.
The discouraging reports on inflation preceded the Federal Reserve meeting which started Tuesday.
The Fed is expected to speed up the process for trimming bond purchases, which have helped keep interest rates low and support the stock market and broader economy. Beyond that, investors are watching the central bank for any statements on how soon it might raise interest rates in 2022.

The Australian sharemarket fell as global markets awaited the outcome of the final US Federal Reserve meeting of the year.
The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index closed 0.7 per cent lower at 7327.1, while the All Ordinaries Index dropped 0.8 per cent to 7636.2.
OMG chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said the week so far had been rocky to say the least.
“Omicron fears were overcome and the market looked strong, only to be thrown off by the US Federal Reserve ... and inflation expectations,” he said.
“The market dropped early and kept falling.
“Tech was the main laggard, followed closely by micro and small caps.
“This type of trading activity outlines market fear of inflation and what central banks will do to combat it.
“Companies with lower cash flows and higher debt risk are more liable to default during an economic downturn and/or higher interest rate environment.”

IG market analyst Kyle Rodda said the broad thrust of what ought to come from the Fed meeting was “practically known”.
“It’ll hasten its quantitative easing tapering, raise inflation forecasts and flag rate hikes next year,” Mr Rodda said.
“But the issue is one of degree and not kind, meaning there’s actually a spectrum of outcomes the market could react to.
“This is where the uncertainty lies and what’s keeping markets on edge right now.”
One of the few bright spots on the local bourse was Coles adding 0.75 per cent to $17.51 but Woolworths closed five cents softer at $37.40 after climbing as high as $37.77.
Mr Tchourilov said his company’s clients snapped up Woolworths en masse after its bearish trading update on Tuesday triggered a massive sell-off, “happily bought up by buy-the-dip investors”.
“Covid-related costs are taking a bite out of earnings, which could spell trouble to the entire consumer staples sector,” he said.
“The supermarket giants that dominated delivery services during lockdown will now be competing with the smaller competitors once again.”
Wesfarmers inched five cents higher to $58.46 after announcing it would vote its 19.3 per cent stake in Australian Pharmaceutical Industries against Woolworths’ rival takeover offer for the Priceline owner.

“Wesfarmers does not intend to accept into any takeover offer made by Woolworths for API,” the Bunnings and Kmart owner said.
Wesfarmers also suggested there was a conflict of interest in the Woolworths bid.
It said API stakeholders were concerned with customer data being shared between Woolworths’ and Priceline’s loyalty programs, highlighting “significant product overlap between pharmacies and supermarkets, which compete across nonprescription health, personal care and beauty categories”.
“That’s all grist for the mill as far as that conversation is concerned .. all what you would expect under the circumstances,” CommSec market analyst Tom Piotrowski said.
“It will be interesting to see where the competition regulator actually lands on that discussion.”
API added 0.29 per cent to $1.71.
Helloworld Travel rocketed 16.16 per cent to $2.66 after announcing it was selling its corporate and entertainment travel businesses in Australia and New Zealand to Corporate Travel Management for $100m in cash and $75m worth of CTM shares.
CTM shares were placed in a trading halt before it divulged a $100m capital raising to pay for the acquisition.

“Oil prices are trending lower, having recently entered a technical bear market as Omicron concerns weigh on the commodity,” Mr Rodda said.
Vulcan Energy, which last week announced it had become a renewable energy producer with the acquisition of a geothermal power plant in Germany, slumped 5.92 per cent to $11.44.

WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate is coming down, inflation is rising, and on Wednesday the Federal Reserve said that combination has it poised for interest rate increases next year that are coming faster and sooner than expected.
The situation amounts to a real-time test of the new approach to monetary policy that the U.S. central bank adopted in August 2020. That framework was meant to prevent the Fed from reacting too swiftly to inflation fears and cutting short what it pledged would be a ""broad and inclusive"" employment recovery.
Now the question analysts and economists will have to entertain is whether the Fed has waited too long to act against inflation, or whether its quick pivot towards higher borrowing costs will return the economy to its pre-pandemic sweet spot of low unemployment and tempered price increases.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com Register
THE PRELUDE
After the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the U.S. economy entered what would become a historically long period of growth. It also showed evidence of fundamental change. The unemployment rate fell steadily, but counter to economic theory inflation never really budged. The Fed slowly raised interest rates. Some policymakers wonder if it was necessary.
Reuters Graphics
WHAT IS THE NEW APPROACH?
Following a two-year review the Fed said it would try to capture more job gains by targeting average inflation instead of the single numerical target of 2%, committing to leave interest rates low for a time as inflation rose. It put that strategy into play with its current policy guidance, promising that rates would not rise until inflation was at 2%, was on target to exceed it for some time, and maximum employment had been reached.
The new strategy was adopted in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, with unemployment high, inflation weak, and an expectation that the economy would behave as before - with low unemployment and low inflation able to coexist.
Instead, the two have run in opposite directions, as they did in earlier decades when low unemployment rates were associated with fast price increases.
Reuters Graphics
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH INFLATION AND JOBS?
Indeed the inflation rates experienced this year not only have been the fastest in decades; the Fed on Wednesday said that its inflation test had been satisfied.
Reuters Graphics
The labor market has been a bit more ambiguous. The new framework referred to maximum employment as a ""broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable,"" language meant to flag that the Fed would not just pay attention to the national unemployment rate, but also to things like labor force participation, wages, or the recovery of jobs among different demographic groups.
From that perspective, the Fed's forward guidance has not been satisfied: There are not only fewer jobs than before the pandemic, fewer people are even looking for work, women's participation in the job market remains depressed, and the unemployment rate for Blacks remains high. The Fed on Wednesday in fact tied any eventual rate hikes to a bit more job market improvement.
Reuters Graphics Reuters Graphics
But full employment may be close. Wages and other costs incurred by employers are rising.

And at 4.2%, the current U.S. unemployment rate is at a level that, in prior years, would have seen the Fed raising rates already.

Bernanke's quip almost three years ago, echoing German economist and MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch, comes to mind as the Fed prepares to raise interest rates against a backdrop of a relentlessly flattening yield curve.
This trend across the curve is a reminder that recession is on the horizon and looming closer into view. Just how close is impossible to say, but analysis of previous tightening cycles suggests it is still years away and will not be an issue in 2022.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com Register
The obvious risk is that the Fed feels it has to jack up borrowing costs aggressively to tame inflation. In this scenario, recession could become an issue very quickly.
Economists at Deutsche Bank note that 13 Fed rate-hiking cycles since 1955 have lasted an average of just under two years. Recession has, on average, historically followed three to three-and-a-half years after the first hike, or ""liftoff.""
The range between the shortest and longest gaps, however, is huge. Recession followed the 1980 hikes just 11 months later, while the next recession after the 1983 hikes was not until 1990, a period of 86 months.
History
The Deutsche Bank research also shows that the 2s/10s yield curve starts at an average level of 100 basis points at the first rate hike, and flattens by 83 basis points in the first year after the hiking cycles begins.
This means it ends the first year of Fed hikes close to flat, on average. In six of the 13 tightening cycles, the curve has inverted a year later, with recession normally following around 18 months after that.
Most economists agree that inversion of the two- and 10-year Treasury yields is as good a warning sign as any of upcoming recession risks. It has preceded all six recessions of the past 40 years.
The gap between the two is currently 77 basis points, so it is still some way from inverting. But it was double that in May, and since then annual inflation has risen to its highest in almost 40 years, and Fed policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, have turned varying degrees of hawkish.
""Timing recessions is very difficult until they are fast upon us,"" the Deutsche Bank economists note, adding: ""History finds that soft landings are very difficult to achieve, and the more so the further central banks are behind the curve.""

CYCLES
Economists at Bank of America agree that recessions always come well after the onset of tightening cycles. They also point out that other shocks are often contributory factors, such as the tech bubble bursting in 2000, and the global credit crunch in 2008.
But the last 40 years also shows that economic contractions come pretty soon after the tightening cycle has ended. So how long will the upcoming cycle last?
Current market pricing has it starting in mid-2022, and likely stretching through end-2024. Economists at Barclays are predicting nine quarter-percentage point increases in total, and economists at UBS expect 10.
Interestingly, this timeline coincides with a rare inversion in the Eurodollar futures market around the late 2024 and early 2025 part of the curve. Alhambra Investment Partners' Jeff Snider says these derivative contracts are ""the most reliable, especially early-warning, indications that exist.""
Like the bond yield curves, the Eurodollars strip is warning that tightening monetary policy in the near term could choke economic growth, which will soon necessitate an easing cycle.
Annual inflation is edging toward 7%, the highest since 1982, and financial markets reckon the Fed will be forced to adopt a more aggressive stance next year. This is reflected in the behavior of the rates futures and yield curves.
Imminent recession, however, seems unlikely. The U.S. economy is comfortably expected to grow by more than 4% next year and the yield curve, notably the 2s/10s part of the curve, is still positively sloping.
But 2023? That may be when the risks start to crystallize, especially if the yield curve inverts.

Fed's Powell to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to announce that it is speeding up the end of its pandemic-era bond purchases and signal a turn to interest rate increases next year as a guard against surging inflation.
The identification of the Omicron coronavirus variant last month has added a new level of uncertainty for U.S. central bank officials who, after steadily discounting the impact of the pandemic on the economy's performance, must now assess how the new strain's faster spread may influence consumers, businesses, and the path of growth and inflation.
Private forecasters polled by Reuters still expect U.S. growth of nearly 4% next year, well above trend, and are aligned around expectations the Fed's increased concern about inflation will cause it to pull the plug on the bond-buying program - originally set at $120 billion per month - in March and pencil in multiple rate increases for 2022.

The Fed will issue a new policy statement along with updated economic projections following the end of its latest two-day meeting at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference half an hour later.
Despite the unknowns around Omicron, the U.S. unemployment and inflation rates have blown past the Fed's most recent projections, issued in September, and policymakers now have to catch up with where the economy and markets seem to be heading.
The policymakers' new forecasts ""will generally show lower projections for the unemployment rate and higher ones for inflation,"" prompting quarter-percentage-point increases in the Fed's short-term policy rate beginning in June, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note ahead of the meeting.
""We think it's a close call between looking for two or three hikes in ’22, but think three is a little more likely,"" Feroli wrote.
Powell's news conference will draw particular attention for how the newly renominated Fed chief frames the policy decision, the risks, and the outlook for next year, and whether his tone suggests more of an elevated concern about inflation, or the potential impact of the Omicron variant.
Either way there may be substantial change in the central bank's policy statement. Powell hinted as much in recent testimony in Congress when he said it was ""time to retire"" the Fed's reference to inflation as ""transitory.""
Instead of easing over 2021, as Fed officials expected, the pace of price increases has remained near levels not seen since the inflation scares of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and gone on long enough that it has begun to depress consumer sentiment, undermine wage increases, and draw fire from politicians in both major political parties.
It has also arguably passed the test the Fed set in September of 2020 when it promised not to raise interest rates until inflation exceeded 2% and was on track to remain above 2% ""for some time.""
Reuters Graphics
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key gauge of inflation for the Fed, rose more than 2% on a year-over-year basis in March and hit 5% in October, with no clear sign that the price-fueling mix of clogged global supply chains and strong U.S. demand would change anytime soon.
'UNDER PRESSURE'
Investors for months have expected the Fed would have to react with higher interest rates to keep prices stable, which is one of its two main objectives mandated by Congress.
Policymakers' main tool to do that is to raise borrowing costs, which can discourage consumers from buying big-ticket items like homes and cars, and also undercut asset values - further depressing demand, and prices, through a ""wealth effect.""
Investors broadly are expecting the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate, currently set at a near-zero level, by a total of 0.75 percentage points next year.
The Fed's other mandated goal is to maintain maximum employment, and the current policy statement pledges to keep interest rates steady ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent"" with it.
With an unemployment rate of 4.2%, the U.S. economy may be close to that point.
But the pandemic's scars run deep and have not fully healed. The number of payroll jobs is about 4 million below the pre-pandemic peak of early 2020, and health, childcare and other concerns may still be keeping people from rejoining the labor force.
While positioning the Fed to act if needed against inflation next year, Powell also may use his news conference on Wednesday to buy time for the job market and rebut the idea that the Fed is now on a firm path to rate hikes and tighter financial conditions.
""The Fed is clearly under pressure to respond"" to higher inflation, Jefferies economist Aneta Markowska wrote late last week. But it is likely to ""gently push back"" against the most aggressive rate-hike expectations and to tie its initial increase in borrowing costs to further progress on employment.

Accelerating inflation may prompt the U.S. central bank to speed up tapering of bond purchases.
""While the market has highly discounted hawkish actions from the U.S. Federal Reserve by means of a quicker wrap-up to the stimulus program, the way the policy meetings pan out in other parts of the world will be a crucial factor in driving the movement in the forex market this week,"" said Imran Kazi, vice president at Mecklai Financial Services, in a note on Dec. 14.
Local factors are playing a role in the Indian currency's weakness as well.
India reported a record high trade deficit for November at $22.9 billion as export growth slowed. A wider trade deficit may push the current account deficit to above 2% of the GDP in the October-December quarter, economists said.
Foreign portfolio flows have also accelerated.
""Theoretically, the exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply for dollars which are based on fundamentals. Hence, when there is a wider trade deficit and capital flows are weak resulting in some outflow of dollars, the rupee should weaken,"" said CareEdge in a report dated Dec.14.
While almost $59 billion in forex reserves have been added since March, there has been an outflow in the last week, the rating agency's research unit pointed out.

The Fed is expected to announce, at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Thursday morning AEDT, that it is speeding up the reduction in bond purchases underway, and will flag lift-off next year for the key US policy rate to slow down rampant inflation.
The US producer prices index (PPI) posted the biggest annual gain in at least 11 years on Tuesday with an eye-popping increase of 9.6 per cent for November, following an 8.8 per cent surge the previous month.
The finished goods PPI jumped by 13.3 per cent from a year ago, the strongest increase since 1980. Worryingly, the PPI for processed goods for intermediate demand soared a staggering 26.5 per cent for the year, a pace that will likely sustain inflationary pressures well into 2022, according to Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist for NAB.
The data comes on the heels of last week’s US CPI report showing the largest annual rise in consumer prices since 1982.

The dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers was at 96.557, having gained 0.5% so far this week in choppy trading. It is testing last week's 96.954, which would be a two-week top. The dollar's gains have been broad-based.
The euro last traded at $1.1265, not far from $1.1184 hit in November, which was its lowest in over a year. The pound languished at $1.13326 as Britain grapples with rising cases of the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus. But the Federal Reserve meeting due to wrap up later in the day stood out as the centrepiece of a week full of central bank meetings.
Kim Mundy, currency strategist at CBA, said currency markets were ""taking a tiny break from Omicron"" even though it was ""very much bubbling away in the background."" ""It's hard for it to be the dominant focus when you've got the FOMC, and the Bank of England and European Central Bank lining up to make policy decisions,"" said Mundy.
She said traders were watching the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee for two things: firstly whether they accelerate tapering of their bond buying programme, and secondly whether policymakers bring forward their projections for interest rate rises, in their so-called ""dot plot"". Markets have been pricing for the Fed to wrap up bond-buying around March and then proceed with one or maybe two rate hikes in 2022.
Elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed analysts have reversed earlier expectations that the Bank of England will raise rates on Thursday, because of the spread of Omicron in Britain. Markets currently expect the Fed to say it will taper its asset buying by between $25 billion-$30 billion a month from $15 billion currently https://www.reuters.com/business/federal-reserves-taper-how-does-it-work-2021-11-03.
Mundy said a figure at the lower end of that range could cause some short-term dollar weakness. The yen softened slightly to 113.78 per dollar, continuing a weakening trend. The safe-haven currency had firmed sharply in late November, when the Omicron variant first emerged.
The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7107, and the Canadian dollar was weaker at 1.2854 per dollar, having been bruised by oil prices coming off recent peaks. Investors in the Australian currency were keeping a close eye on Chinese economic activity data due later in the day, given that China is Australia's largest trading partner.

Asian markets are precariously poised as the world waits to hear from the US Federal Reserve on when it will stop buying assets and start raising interest rates, possibly piling pressure on its peers to follow. Futures have already priced in an end to tapering by March and a first hike to 0.25 per cent in May or June, with rates approaching 0.75 per cent by year end. Bank of America's latest survey of fund managers shows they favour an end to tapering in April and only two hikes in 2022, making them more vulnerable to a hawkish outlook. Also vital will be the ultimate destination for rates, given markets are currently priced for a peak of just 1.5-1.75 per cent, a level that would likely not even top inflation. ""At its heart, there is an implied assumption that all the Fed has to do is tap the fed funds brake a mere 150bps, and the economy will slow sufficiently to break the inflation cycle,"" noted Alan Ruskin, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. ""Yet we have never had a cycle peak where real rates have not been above zero, which means the market's expected terminal rate is too low and possibly far too low."" Should Fed members agree and plot a much higher peak, it would challenge the lofty valuations of stocks and the slim yields offered by Treasuries. Right now, bonds are implying cash rates will average only 1.8 per cent for the next 30 years. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant is an added complication that could incline the Fed to be less hawkish, though recently officials have sounded more concerned about the persistence of inflation than the pandemic. Whatever the Fed decides, it will set the bar for the central banks of the EU, UK and Japan when they meet this week, and add to pressure for further tightening in emerging markets. So many potential pitfalls kept investors nervous and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 per cent in slow trade. Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.1 per cent and South Korea lost 0.3 per cent. Data on Chinese retail sales and industrial production are also due later on Wednesday, followed by US retail sales. Nasdaq futures and S&P 500 futures were all but flat in early trade, having lost ground overnight. Treasury yields were a shade higher in the wake of an unexpectedly strong reading for US producer price inflation overnight. Ten-year yields nudged up to 1.44 per cent, but remain well short of the recent top of 1.693 per cent. The yield curve continued its flattening trend as investors wager an earlier start to Fed tightening will lead to slower inflation in the long run. The prospect of rising short-term rates supported the US dollar, particularly against the euro and yen where monetary policy is expected to lag. The single currency eased back to $US1.1256 and was again approaching its recent trough of $US1.1184. The dollar firmed to 113.71 yen and near resistance at 113.95. The US dollar index pushed up to 96.554. The risk of rising cash rates has been a burden for gold, which offers no fixed return, and left it sidelined at $US1,772 an ounce. Oil prices eased after the International Energy Agency said the spread of Omicron would dent the recovery in global fuel demand. US crude lost 34 cents in early action to stand at $US70.39 per barrel. Australian Associated Press
