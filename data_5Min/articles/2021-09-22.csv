Evergrande’s Frankfurt-listed shares jumped 41.0% after hitting multi-year lows in the previous session.
The property developer said it would make a coupon payment on its domestic bonds, offering relief to investors worried about payments default following financial troubles.
“It’s been another positive session for European stocks, as concerns about fallout from Evergrande continue to diminish, after this morning’s agreement on some of its domestic bond coupons,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
“Despite this little wrinkle, markets appear to be working on the assumption that the problem has been contained, let’s hope they are right.”
The travel & leisure index rose 2.5% hitting a 14-week high, after Entain jumped 5.1% on revealing a $22.4 billion takeover proposal from Boston-based DraftKings.
Online betting group Flutter Entertainment gained 4.0% after it agreed to pay $200 million to the Commonwealth of Kentucky to settle a judgment reinstated last year.
The Europe-wide STOXX 600 index rose 1.0%, extending Tuesday’s bounce after its worst session in two months, with commodity-linked stocks and banks leading gains.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is set to conclude its two-day policy meeting later in the day, with investors expecting it to clear the way for cuts to its monthly asset purchases later this year and update its inflation and growth projections.
“Fed Chair Jerome Powell will most probably be clear on the central bank’s commitment to start lowering bond purchases before year-end but short on details about the pace and the composition of tapering,” Unicredit analysts said in a note.
“An announcement like this would be in line with Powell’s presentation at the central bank symposium in Jackson Hole in late August and is unlikely to surprise investors.”
After seven straight months of gains, sentiment has soured across global equities in September on worries about China’s slowing growth, the fast-spreading Delta variant of COVID-19 and tighter monetary policies.
The STOXX 600 is down 1.6% so far this month and is set for its worst monthly performance in about a year.

2,The Federal Reserve is getting ready to roll back its massive stimulus,2021-09-22T16:00:00Z,"The Federal Reserve isn't ready to take its foot off the stimulus gas pedal just yet, but that soon might change.","(CNN) — The Federal Reserve isn't ready to take its foot off the stimulus gas pedal just yet, but that soon might change.
If the economic recovery continues to progress as expected, the Fed ""judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,"" according to the bank's policy update published Wednesday.
This raises the prospects of a November announcement that it will step on the brakes. But even if such a move was delayed until December or January, it wouldn't matter much to markets, which have already priced in a policy change, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, in emailed comments.
The Fed could also lift interest rates as early as next year, according to updated projections, as opposed to waiting until 2023 as previous forecasts called for.
Taper time
When the pandemic started to wreak havoc on the US economy in early 2020, the Fed stepped in, slashing interest rates to near-zero and committing to buying $120 billion worth of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities every month. These purchases will be rolled back soon, it seems, in what is referred to as a ""taper.""
It's the Fed's job to keep prices stable and achieve maximum employment. Over the past months, Powell had said that more progress was needed on those fronts until a change in policies is warranted. But now his tone has changed: While the test for inflation is already met, the test for employment is ""all but met,"" Powell told reporters during Wednesday's press conference.
""For me it would not take a knock-out great [September] employment report,"" Powell added, even though other members of the policy committee still wanted to see further improvements.
Investors have long expected the Fed to clamp down on its monthly stimulus as the recovery was coming along nicely over the summer. But a disappointing August jobs report pushed those expectations back. Wednesday's announcement was thus in line with what investors predicted and the stock market continued its rally after it was published.
Roadblocks ahead
There are still a few hurdles that the economy, and the market, need to overcome.
In Washington, the debt ceiling debate is heating up as lawmakers try to find a way to keep the government from running out of cash.
""It's just very important that the debt ceiling be raised so that the United States can pay its bills when they come due,"" Powell said, adding that the damage to the economy and financial markets would be severe if there were a default. Nobody should assume the Fed could fully protect the economy against such a failure, he added.
Meanwhile, the recovery has hit some roadblocks recently as the Delta variant is leading to more infections and affecting people's willingness to be around others.
And as many economists began to factor the Delta effect into their winter forecasts for the economy, so has the Fed. Its projections see lower economic growth for 2021 with gross domestic product rising 5.9%, compared with the 7% it projected in June. The growth rate for 2022, however, was revised upwards to 3.8% from 3.3%.
Similarly, the Fed now expects unemployment to be slightly higher -- at 4.8% -- than previously thought at the end of this year. Similarly, inflation is also will likely be higher by year-end than projected in June, as it's taking longer for bottlenecks and shortages that drive up prices to abate. The personal consumption expenditure index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, is expected to be at 4.2% for the year rather than 3.4% previously forecast.
Spikes in inflation over the summer fueled the market view that the Fed would soon reign in its easy-money policies sooner rather than later to keep the economy from overheating.

Fed policymakers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July - signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation - and been conflicted among themselves about how to react.
Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year.
But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the “taper” might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created.
The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome.
The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the “substantial further progress” the Fed has said it wants to see in the labor market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis. While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May.
Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well, and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be “conditional on a solid September employment gain.”
The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic.
More then 60% of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December.
Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program. Financial markets have been roiled in the last week by concerns about spillover effects from the potential collapse of a large Chinese property developer, China Evergrande Group, and the S&P 500 index kicked off the week with its largest daily loss in four months.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers appear no closer to resolving a partisan standoff in Congress over lifting the federal debt ceiling, with the potential for a partial shutdown of the federal government rising by the day.
INFLATION WATCH
When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates.
Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed’s Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates. It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
Policymakers’ new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials penciling in an initial increase for next year.
The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2% on an annualized basis. That is double the central bank’s 2% target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank’s new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates.
Leaning in the other direction: The surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Since June, when the Fed noted the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and said the economy’s performance appeared to be separating from the pandemic, the seven-day average of new daily infections had ballooned five-fold to 66,000 by the central bank’s July 27-28 meeting. It has roughly doubled again since then.
Some measures of service activity have dipped, prompting forecasters to mark down their outlooks for economic growth this year.

Property giant and Asia’s biggest junk bond issuer Evergrande said it “resolved” one payment due on Thursday via a private negotiation, easing concerns of default and possible contagion risk, while the People’s Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan into the banking system to support markets.
“Being able to make tomorrow’s bond coupon payment, that definitely lifted risk sentiment overnight and you saw a typical follow-through reaction in risk currencies, so Canadian dollar high, Aussie dollar higher, Kiwi dollar higher - that was kind of an understandable reaction,” said Erik Bregar, an independent FX analyst in Toronto.
Still, uncertainty remains whether the developer will be able to pay the coupon on its offshore dollar bonds, due on Thursday.
The Australian dollar rose 0.28% versus the greenback at $0.725 after rising as much as 0.49% to $0.7268 while the Canadian dollar rose 0.38% versus the greenback at 1.28 per dollar.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback at 6.4628 per dollar.
All eyes will be on the Fed later in the session for its policy announcement for signs of when the U.S. central bank plans to begin trimming its monthly asset purchases as well as any insight into the timing of a possible rate hike.
“There is definitely a more clear consensus going into this meeting, vis-a-vis the previous one, people are looking for a more clear timeline on taper, we have all heard these expectations about a signal to start in November then the actual pace of purchase start declining in September, you could argue expectations are a tad hawkish coming in,” Bregar said.
The dollar index fell 0.07%, with the euro up 0.09% to $1.1734.
The safe-haven Japanese yen weakened 0.27% versus the greenback at 109.51 per dollar in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s decision to keep policy on hold.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 0.5 basis points at 1.319% as investors awaited the statement and remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The market consensus expects the Fed as soon as November to begin to reduce its Treasury purchases by $10 billion a month and mortgage-backed security purchases by $5 billion a month. The timeframe could be much slower that people expect, with the consensus view executed on a quarterly basis, not monthly, said Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC. ""You need to make sure the system adjusts very slowly to the developments. There's a lot of concern on the committee that if they pull back too quickly, they will cause a problem,"" Ricchiuto said. The Fed likely will reduce its growth numbers for 2021 and next year, while raising its inflation target for the two years, Ricchiuto said. The unemployment rate target may also be raised a touch, but stagflation will not be part of the picture. ""People will read a little bit of stagflation into the numbers, which I don't think is valid. Stagflation isn't possible in the world we live in,"" Ricchiuto said. A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, seen as an indicator of economic expectations, was at 109.6 basis points. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 0.6 basis points at 0.222%. The breakeven rate on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) was last at 2.455%. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate was last at 2.298%, indicating the market sees inflation averaging about 2.3% a year for the next decade.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was on course for its biggest percentage gain in two months on Wednesday as energy stocks climbed more than 3%, while investors focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision due later in the day.
The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index added 0.75% to 20,395.51, set for its best day since July 21.
The energy group extended gains for a second straight session as crude prices climbed more than $1 after data showed U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected last week in the wake of two hurricanes.
The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.6%.
Commodities and other risky assets rallied as China’s central bank injected cash into the banking system and on relief that the country’s debt-burdened Evergrande would pay interest on a domestic bond.
“Now with People’s Bank of China stepping in to support China’s financial system, commodities are bouncing back and that’s a positive for Canadian markets,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.
Traders are tracking the Fed’s policy meeting for clues on when the U.S. central bank will begin to trim its massive pandemic-era stimulus measures.
“At some point the markets will ask why not, because if the economy is strong, and inflation is picking up and then one would think the Fed should be tapering, just like the Bank of Canada has been,” added Cieszynski.
The Canadian benchmark index, which has recorded seven straight months of gains, is on track to end September in the red amid concerns over slowing global growth, rising inflation and the spread of the Delta COVID-19 variant.

10,Federal Reserve to deliver policy decision at 2 p.m. ET,2021-09-22T14:11:45Z,The main question: when will the Federal Reserve start pulling back on its extraordinary monetary stimulus?,"When will the Federal Reserve start pulling back on its extraordinary monetary stimulus?
That's the major question that Fed watchers hope to get an answer for later this afternoon, when the Federal Open Market Committee releases its updated policy decision.
Chatter has been building within the central bank over slowing the pace of its asset purchases.
Since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed has been absorbing about $120 billion a month in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled that the FOMC is likely to begin the process of ""tapering"" those purchases before the end of the year.
Weaker-than-expected August data could push back an official taper announcement to the FOMC's November meeting. If the Fed has nothing to announce this afternoon, attention will likely shift to the Fed's projections on interest rates.
The FOMC is expected to release an updated ""dot plot,"" mapping out each of the 18 committee members' expectations for where interest rates will go through 2024. The central bank messaged in June the likelihood of two interest rate hikes before the end of 2023. Fed watchers will be closely watching if Fed officials feel more optimistic about the ability to further raise rates over the next few years.
Powell will face a number of questions on tapering and the dot plot, but reporters will also likely quiz him on the flurry of other news items confronting the central bank.
Powell may field questions on the risks presented by the debt ceiling debate and the financial troubles of Chinese real estate giant Evergrande. Concerns have also been raised over the Fed's ethics rules after the revelation of senior Fed officials making large stock trades over the course of 2020.
The FOMC statement and dot plot projections will be released at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.

The Fed will reveal its latest thinking later today, the Bank at noon tomorrow, with analysts warning that the chances of a misstep that leads to a big shift in bond prices is high.
Recent economic woes such as a global supply chain crisis and soaring energy costs may also make it harder for the central banks to begin withdrawing support for the economy by pulling back on quantitative easing – mass purchases of government bonds.
Inflation keeps beating central banks’ expectations, causing many economists to bring forward their prediction of when interest rates will rise. Many now say that will come early next year.
Capital Economics is a rare outlier, insisting rates will remain unchanged at 0.1% until 2023. It told clients: “The Monetary Policy Committee signalled in August that it is getting closer to raising interest rates, but the gloomy tone of the recent news on the global and UK economies will have reduced the pressure…to tighten policy.”
Signs of a flip-flop on rates or QE are likely to rattle already frayed investor nerves.
Inflation climbed to 3.2% in August from July’s 2%, the biggest spike on record.

Chris Wattie/Reuters
The Federal Reserve is expected to clear the way on Wednesday for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year and show in updated projections whether higher-than-expected inflation or a resurgent coronavirus pandemic is weighing more on the economic outlook.
Fed policy-makers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July – signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation – and been conflicted among themselves about how to react.
Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120-billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year.
Story continues below advertisement
But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the “taper” might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created.
The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome.
The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the “substantial further progress” the Fed has said it wants to see in the labour market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis. While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May.
Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well, and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be “conditional on a solid September employment gain.”
The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic.
More than 60 per cent of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December.
Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program.
Story continues below advertisement
Financial markets have been roiled in the last week by concerns about spillover effects from the potential collapse of a large Chinese property developer, China Evergrande Group, and the S&P 500 index kicked off the week with its largest daily loss in four months.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers appear no closer to resolving a partisan standoff in Congress over lifting the federal debt ceiling, with the potential for a partial shutdown of the federal government rising by the day.
INFLATION WATCH
When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates.
Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed’s Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates. It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
Policy-makers’ new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials pencilling in an initial increase for next year.
The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2 per cent on an annualized basis. That is double the central bank’s 2 per cent target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank’s new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates.

Leaning in the other direction: The surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Since June, when the Fed noted the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and said the economy’s performance appeared to be separating from the pandemic, the seven-day average of new daily infections had ballooned fivefold to 66,000 by the central bank’s July 27-28 meeting. It has roughly doubled again since then.
Some measures of service activity have dipped, prompting forecasters to mark down their outlooks for economic growth this year.
The Fed may well follow suit.

London (CNN Business) Six weeks ago, the Federal Reserve was sending signals that it was time to start backing away from crisis-era support for the US economy.
""It's not clear to me that we're really doing anything useful here,"" St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Aug. 10 of the Fed's $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan agreed. ""What I don't want to do is keeping running at this speed for too long, and then we're going to have to take more aggressive action down the road,"" he told CNBC around the same time.
But the picture has changed since then, and when the Fed makes its latest policy announcement on Wednesday , it's expected to reiterate that for now, at least, it's sitting tight.
""A no change decision at the upcoming [Fed] meeting looks a foregone conclusion,"" ING strategists wrote in a recent note to clients, pointing to Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium last month, which indicated that the central bank is not in a rush to change course.
Breaking it down: Inflation is still running hot. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Fed's favorite measure, rose at a rate of 4.2% in the year ended July, the fastest pace since January 1991. That's more than double the central bank's 2% target.
PPG PPG Sherwin-Williams SHW This month, a number of companies have revised down their earnings expectations as a result of higher prices., which makes paints and coatings, said third quarter sales volumes would be $225 million to $275 million lower, citing supply chain problems and raw material inflation. Competitormade a similar announcement.
Some economic data also indicates the US economy is powering through the impact of the Delta variant. Counter to expectations, US retail sales increased last month as consumers shelled out on clothing, furniture and groceries.
Taken together, inflation readings and signs of economic resilience should be encouraging the Fed to act sooner rather than later. But Wall Street now thinks the central bank will make this call in November, with the tapering of bond purchases starting by near end.
Why? Simply because the situation remains murky. In August, spending at restaurants was flat month-over-month, indicating Delta concerns are having some effect on consumers. And the most recent US jobs report showed that just 235,000 positions were added in August, a major disappointment.
""Ultimately, the determination of the decision on tapering likely comes down to the pace of labor market improvement over coming months,"" Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief US economist, said in a research note. She thinks the Fed will delay a tapering announcement until December so it can parse more jobs data.
Watch this space: With agreement that the Fed is on hold for the time being, the most market-sensitive moment of Wednesday's announcement is likely to be the release of the central bank's latest economic forecasts, as well as its ""dot plot,"" which tracks expectations for when interest rate hikes will kick in.
In the last update, seven out of 18 Fed officials said rate increases would likely start in 2022. ING thinks it's conceivable that ""one or two more bring their forecast forward"" to next year. ""We suspect the median stays at 2023 for now, but it will be a close call,"" the bank predicts.
Evergrande meets crucial debt deadline, but another looms
China's Evergrande Group will pay interest due Thursday on one of its bonds, but it's keeping rattled investors guessing about the fate of a second, bigger payment due this week.
The latest: The troubled Chinese real estate conglomerate said Wednesday in a filing with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that issues regarding a payment on a domestic yuan bond have been ""settled through negotiations.""
Many questions remain unanswered, though, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports. Evergrande did not elaborate on the terms of the payment. The amount of interest it owes on the bond is about 232 million yuan ($36 million), according to data from Refinitiv.
Interest worth $83.5 million on a dollar-denominated bond is also due Thursday, though the company has not said anything publicly about what will happen with that payment.
Remember: Evergrande is stumbling under $300 billion worth of liabilities, which are widely held by Chinese financial institutions, retail investors, home buyers and suppliers in construction, materials and design industries. Foreign investors also hold some of its debt.
In the last few weeks, the company warned investors twice that it could default if it's unable to raise money quickly.
It's not clear whether the company will actually default, or whether Beijing will intervene and orchestrate some other type of restructuring. But the company's failure would likely create aftershocks that could ripple through the financial market and the broader Chinese economy.
""There appears to be an acceptance that an Evergrande failure is more a matter of when and not if, and the real question is how any fallout is managed,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a report Wednesday.
The debt debate is heading for a Senate showdown
The House of Representatives voted Tuesday to pass legislation to prevent a government shutdown at the end of the month and suspend the nation's borrowing limit. Now comes phase two: a showdown with Republicans who insist Democrats should act alone to stave off a looming debt crisis.
The backstory: Government funding is set to expire on Sept. 30. The bill the House approved would extend funding and keep the government open through Dec. 3, while shelving the country's debt limit until December 2022. But the bill now faces an uphill battle in the Senate.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned of dire consequences if the debt ceiling isn't raised, barring the government from paying its bills as soon as next month.
""The US has never defaulted. Not once,"" she wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal published Sunday. ""Doing so would likely precipitate a historic financial crisis that would compound the damage of the continuing public health emergency.""
Goldman Sachs observed that ""investors are growing concerned about market spillovers"" from a political standoff in a note to clients on Tuesday. Yet the data indicates those fears may be overblown.
""History shows that US government shutdowns generally have not meaningfully impacted equity returns,"" the investment bank said.
Still, a possible debt crisis is far from the only issue provoking ""extreme fear"" on Wall Street, according to the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index. Combined with the situation surrounding Evergrande and uncertainty about the economy and the path of central bank action, the debt debate could trigger more volatility than usual in the days to come.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday as concerns over China’s Evergrande eased after the property developer negotiated a domestic bond payment deal, with investors now awaiting policy cues from the Federal Reserve later in the day.
Evergrande’s main unit said it had negotiated a deal with bondholders to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, which helped calm fears of an imminent default that could unleash global financial chaos.
The S&P 500 has fallen for 10 of the past 12 sessions since hitting a record high, as fears of an Evergrande default exacerbated seasonally weak trends and saw investors pull out of stocks trading at lofty valuations.
Focus now turns to the Fed’s decision, due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) where the bank could possibly unveil plans to begin scaling back its massive coronavirus-related stimulus measures.
A raft of positive economic data in recent weeks has strengthened expectations for a taper announcement from the central bank by as soon as September.

The Federal Reserve is finishing up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and officials are expected to signal that they will soon slow their large bond-buying program — the central bank’s first step in weaning the economy off the support it has offered since shortly after the pandemic began.
This Fed meeting is shaping up to be among the most closely watched of the year. Central bank officials are in the process of teeing up their plans to slow large-scale purchases of government-backed debt, which they have been using to keep longer-term interest rates low and many types of borrowing cheap. The Fed has been carefully broadcasting its progress toward the so-called taper, in hopes that it can avoid surprising and roiling markets. Officials could provide further details on the expected timing and pace.
The Fed — which will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. — will also provide fresh economic projections. Those will include policymakers’ predictions of when they might lift their main interest rate from near-zero, a move that officials have signaled is still months or even years away.
“The Fed has been very clear on their intentions,” said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America, noting that officials want to get moving on the bond program so that they can separate it from the path ahead for the federal funds rate. “That’s one of the reasons they want to get the taper underway — they just want it on the back burner.”
Most economists expect the Fed to formally announce the tapering plan at its November meeting, and few expect officials to signal a precise timeline this week. Instead, they will probably say that they hope to slow bond purchases before the end of the year, and may offer hints about how quickly the purchases will draw to a close.
“Their goal is just to keep inching toward the taper,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. “Why pre-commit yourself?” Indeed, there’s a reason for all the tiptoeing. In 2013, when a former Fed Chair suggested that a post-financial-crisis bond purchase program would slow, it roiled global markets in what became known as the “taper tantrum.” Jerome H. Powell, the current Fed chair, has managed to avoid a similar fate so far, but the stakes right now are particularly high. Markets have been rocky this week as investors have fretted about stress in China’s real estate sector and the Fed’s plans. That risk is probably not enough to dissuade central bankers from sticking to the course they have charted, economists said. “It’s taken some effort to get Fed officials all on the same page, and to get the Fed and the markets on the same page,” Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said in an email Monday. “I’d be surprised if they want to upend that for something that may be fleeting.” The Fed is also wrestling with more long-lasting questions about the economic outlook. Inflation has been elevated this year as the economy has begun to reopen from the pandemic and supply has struggled to keep pace with rapid consumer demand, and some measures of consumer inflation expectations are creeping higher. If that continues, rapid price gains could become more permanent. That would run counter to one of the Fed’s two main goals. The central bank is in charge of keeping inflation low and steady — it aims for 2 percent annual increases in prices on average over time — while fostering maximum employment. But full employment also remains elusive. Millions of jobs are still missing, even after months of historically rapid employment gains, and officials want to avoid lifting interest rates to cool off the economy before the labor market has fully healed. It’s difficult to know when that might be, because the economy has never recovered from pandemic-induced lockdowns before. Tapering bond purchases could give the Fed room to be nimble going forward, allowing it to lift interest rates relatively quickly if it appears that inflation is climbing in a way that is likely to be sustained. Officials have signaled that they would prefer not to lift interest rates before bond buying is brought to a close. After the Fed releases its statement, Mr. Powell will offer a statement and take questions from reporters at 2:30 p.m.

Hong Kong markets were closed, but Evergrande’s Frankfurt listing surged about 20% after its unit said a coupon payment totalling 232 million yuan ($35.88 million) on its Shenzhen-traded 5.8% September 2025 bond would be made on time.
But worries remained as Evergrande made no mention of an $83.53 million coupon payment on an offshore dollar bond also due on Thursday. Evergrande’s total debt stands at $305 billion.
“This is obviously a fluid situation that we will need to monitor closely... there could be some further impact,” Kevin Headland, senior investment strategist at Manulife Investment Management told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that they don’t expect a default to lead to widespread contagion.
“We think emerging market equities are very attractive longer term, provided you understand the risk of shorter term volatility. The fundamentals are supportive of EM... These market events often create dislocations that provide opportunity.”
Later in the day, the Fed is expected to drop more hints on its future policy path, including when it will start tapering its bond buying and, eventually, raising interest rates.
The dollar was steady, lending some support to EM currencies. The onshore yuan rose from near four-week lows. China kept its benchmark lending rate for corporate and household loans unchanged, as expected.
Russia’s rouble climbed a healthy 0.8%, supported by rising oil prices.
Officials said Russia will spend around 2.5 trillion roubles ($34 billion) from its National Wealth Fund in the next three years to help revive economic growth leading up to elections in 2024. But the central bank has warned that spending from the Fund too freely could fan inflation further.
South Africa’s rand firmed 0.5% after losing more than 4.5% over the last six days, while Turkey’s lira was flat.
The central banks of both countries are expected to keep rates unchanged when they meet on Thursday. South Africa's inflation was 4.9% in August, above expectations and up from 4.6% in July. South Africa's central bank has a 3%-6% inflation target range.

18,Nikkei hits two-week low on caution before U.S. Fed meet,2021-09-22T07:03:50Z,"The Nikkei hit a more than two-week low on Wednesday as investors looked ahead warily to the outcome of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, seeking more clues on when policymakers will wind down stimulus and lift interest rates.","TOKYO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Nikkei hit a more than two-week low on Wednesday as investors looked ahead warily to the outcome of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, seeking more clues on when policymakers will wind down stimulus and lift interest rates.
The benchmark closed down 0.67% at 29,639.40, while the broader Topix slid 1.02% to end at 2,043.55, also the lowest since Sept. 6.
The Nikkei briefly changed course earlier in the day to trade higher after China Evergrande’s main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, said it would pay some bond interest due on Thursday, allaying fears of an imminent collapse.
That still did not push the Nikkei above 30,000, after it lost that level on Tuesday, the start of a holiday-shortened week, according to Shigetoshi Kamada, general manager at the research department of Tachibana Securities.
“That is because investor focus is on the Fed meeting... how the interest rate projections will look like and whether the Fed will start tapering before the end of the year,” he said.
The outcome of the Fed’s two-day meeting is scheduled at 1800 GMT with a news conference half an hour later.
Japanese markets will be closed for another holiday on Thursday.
Trading houses led the decline in Japanese equities, dropping 2.37%. Itochu was the worst performer among the Topix’s 30 core names, losing 4.08%, while Mitsui & Co slid 2.86%.
Machinery makers also fell, with Daikin Industries shedding 2.94%.
Mizuho Financial slipped 1.22% after a report that the regulator would oversee system management at the banking group following a series of technical failures.
Peer Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group gained 1.42% after it said it would pull back from U.S. retail banking with the $8 billion sale of MUFG Union Bank.
Some heavyweight names were among the other top gainers. Start-up investor SoftBank Group advanced 1.9% and Uniqlo clothing shop-owner Fast Retailing gained 1.78%. Nintendo rose 1.1%.

China fell on its first day of trade after a two-day holiday. However, a cash injection from the People’s Bank of China kept falls far smaller than feared with blue chips off 0.7% and Shanghai Composite reversing losses to trade up 0.3%.
That weighed on MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which fell 0.3%, however, Australia was higher.
Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.6%. Hong Kong markets were shut.
Evergrande’s main unit, Hengda Real Estate, said it had settled interest payments due Thursday on a yuan bond with investors, which helped lift sentiment and trim losses.
“I think the market is still a little bit cagey,” said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific head of research at ING in Singapore.
“It’s Evergrande today, who will it be tomorrow? That’s probably why we haven’t seen a substantial and perhaps prolonged rally as a result of this,” he said.
The news sent S&P 500 futures, U.S. Treasury yields and the Australian dollar higher, before shedding some of those gains as traders were left with few details and as Evergrande made no mention of dollar bond interest also due on Thursday.
S&P 500 futures were last up 0.2%. European futures inched up 0.3%. After rising, safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasury yields eased back to flat at 1.3311%.
Globally, markets had also already started to calm as analysts downplayed the threat of Evergrande’s troubles becoming a “Lehman moment” and setting off a financial crisis.
European markets rallied on Tuesday and on Wall Street the S&P 500 fared little worse than flat, sitting about 4% below a record made early in the month.
Focus now seems to be shifting to trying to gauge Beijing’s so-far muted response amid worries about the consequences for an economy that is slowing and financial markets reeling from months of disruptive and radical reform.
“(The) Evergrande debacle is further stoking concern over the fallout from China’s broadening crackdown,” analysts at Rabobank said in a note to clients, pointing out new rules on everything from online gaming to developers debt levels.
“As a consequence, Evergrande can perhaps be seen not so much as a potential crisis trigger but rather a symptom of a broader policy shift which threatens Chinese growth as politics dominate economic considerations.”
In currency markets, the Aussie rose slightly, having given up some of its early-session blip while the safe-haven yen was a tad weaker. [FRX/]
Moves were capped ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, however, and the dollar was flat against the euro, with the risk of a hawkish Fed supporting the dollar.
Most analysts think the Fed will not go into detail about its tapering plans but say risks lie in board members’ “dot plot” of rates projections.
“Even though a tapering announcement is not expected, the dot plot may deliver a hawkish surprise and require Powell to be dovish and push back in the press conference,” said National Australia Bank’s director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland.
The outcome of the Fed’s meeting is announced at 1800 GMT with a news conference half an hour later.

Fed policymakers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July - signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation - and been conflicted among themselves about how to react.
Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year.
But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the “taper” might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created.
The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome.
The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the “substantial further progress” the Fed has said it wants to see in the labor market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis. While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May.
Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well, and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be “conditional on a solid September employment gain.”
The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic.
More then 60% of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December.
Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program. Financial markets have been roiled in the last week by concerns about spillover effects from the potential collapse of a large Chinese property developer, China Evergrande Group, and the S&P 500 index kicked off the week with its largest daily loss in four months.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers appear no closer to resolving a partisan standoff in Congress over lifting the federal debt ceiling, with the potential for a partial shutdown of the federal government rising by the day.
INFLATION WATCH
When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates.
Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed’s Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates. It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
Policymakers’ new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials penciling in an initial increase for next year.
The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2% on an annualized basis. That is double the central bank’s 2% target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank’s new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates.
Leaning in the other direction: The surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Since June, when the Fed noted the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and said the economy’s performance appeared to be separating from the pandemic, the seven-day average of new daily infections had ballooned five-fold to 66,000 by the central bank’s July 27-28 meeting. It has roughly doubled again since then.
Some measures of service activity have dipped, prompting forecasters to mark down their outlooks for economic growth this year.

24,Five things to watch at Federal Reserve policy meeting,2021-09-22T04:56:47Z,"Here are five things to look for from the meeting, which wraps up on Wednesday","Federal Reserve policymakers begin a two-day meeting Tuesday to discuss the US jobs and inflation outlook and craft a policy response that could edge the central bank closer to dialing down its support for the economy.
Here are five things to look for from the meeting, which wraps up on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. (1800 GMT)
FURTHER PROGRESS?
The Fed has promised not to cut back on the $120 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities it is buying each month until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its goals of maximum employment and 2% inflation.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell in August said he felt that bar has already been met on inflation, and saw “clear progress” on the employment front, making a bond program taper likely appropriate this year.
But that was before a government report showed an unexpectedly weak gain of 235,000 jobs last month.
Policymakers will debate the jobs trajectory, now that the summer’s COVID-19 surge has begun to recede, and the risk of inflation becoming persistent.
At their last meeting in July, policymakers noted “progress” toward their goals.
Adding an adjective like “clear” or “further” would be one way to move closer to a decision to reduce their bond-buying, perhaps as soon as November.
DOTS
Fed policymakers want to separate a decision to taper asset purchases from a later decision to raise their short-term policy rate from near zero.
Quarterly projections due on Wednesday could muddy that distinction if they show Fed policymakers pulling forward to 2022 their expectation for that first rate hike.
In June the majority expected to keep rates where they are until 2023 or later. This meeting will be the first to include forecasts for 2024.
DEBT CEILING DEBACLE
Without lawmaker action to raise the current $28.4 trillion limit on federal government borrowing, the country will run out of operating funds on Oct. 1, triggering a partial government shutdown. Weeks later the nation could run out of funds to pay its bills.
The resulting default would roil markets, plunge the country back into recession and permanently damage the American economy, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said.
The last time the nation faced a similar debt ceiling scare, in 2013, Fed policymakers secretly mapped out a range of potential actions to counter what they thought could be severe and destabilizing market stress. It’s unlikely Powell will provide any clear roadmap this week, but he may be asked about it at his news conference Wednesday.
CHANGE AT THE TOP
This week’s meeting is the last before changes in Fed leadership that could prove to be anywhere from measured to historic, depending on how US President Joe Biden uses the opportunity.
Randal Quarles’ term as vice chair for supervision ends on Oct. 13. He may stay on as Fed governor, but Biden is expected to name another as the Fed’s new financial regulation czar.
Biden will also need to decide whether to reappoint Powell and whom to pick to succeed Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, whose term ends Jan. 31. There is also one vacant seat on the Fed’s seven-member board.
An announcement could come in the weeks before the Fed’s next two-day session on Nov. 2-3.
MARKETS, ETHICS
Other issues are also battling for Fed policymakers’ attention. Among them:
A US stock market plunge on worry that a potential default by property developer China Evergrande Group could destabilize global financial markets.

Summary FedEx falls on profit drop, forecast cut
Investors split over Fed's taper plans
Indexes surge: Dow 1.40%, S&P 1.25%, Nasdaq 1.16%
Sept 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes bounced back from recent losses on Wednesday as concerns over a default by China's Evergrande eased, with investors now awaiting policy cues from a Federal Reserve meetinglater in the day.
The S&P (.SPX) and the Dow (.DJI) were headed for their best day in two months after Evergrande's main unit said it had negotiated a deal with bondholders to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, calming fears of an imminent default that could unleash global financial chaos. read more
Heavyweight technology names were the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), while the Dow Jones was supported by big banks tracking Treasury yields.
Wall Street indexes are nursing steep losses in September, as fears of an Evergrande default exacerbated seasonally weak trends and saw investors pull out of stocks trading at lofty valuations.
As of Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 (.SPX) had tumbled 4.2% from an intraday record high hit earlier in the month.
Uncertainty over U.S. fiscal spending and a potential hike in corporate taxes have also chipped away at stocks this month.
Focus now turns to the Fed's decision, due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) where the bank could possibly unveil plans to begin scaling back its massive coronavirus-related stimulus measures.
Positive readings on retail sales and factory activitythis month had strengthened expectations for a taper announcement from the central bank by as soon as September.
But weakness in the stock market had analysts questioning whether the Fed would risk further volatility, given that any concrete announcement on tapering would likely trigger more stock selling.
The stock market turmoil and fiscal uncertainty would give Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""convenient excuses to reiterate his intent to taper, but allow him to fall short of actually committing to a November start to tapering,"" said Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Quill Intelligence.
At 11:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 475.84 points, or 1.40% , to 34,395.68, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 54.62 points, or 1.25 %, to 4,408.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) gained 169.77 points, or 1.16 %, to 14,916.92.
Despite the day's gains, analysts questioned whether stocks would retain their momentum, given the sharp spike in volatility seen this week.
""We're going to see a little bit more volatility till there are new leaders leading the way,"" said Paul Feinstein, chief executive officer of Audent Global Asset Management.
""The markets are trying to digest what the next six-nine months are going to look like, especially with all the news coming out of China.""
Among individual stocks, FedEx Corp (FDX.N) tumbled 8% on posting a lower quarterly profit, and as the delivery firm cut its full-year earnings forecast. read more
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a about a 3-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 45 new highs and 50 new lows.

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped ahead of a policy announcement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, while risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar and Chinese yuan strengthened after China's Evergrande said it would make a bond coupon payment.
Property giant and Asia's biggest junk bond issuer Evergrande (3333.HK) said it ""resolved"" one payment due on Thursday via a private negotiation, easing concerns of default and possible contagion risk, while the People's Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan into the banking system to support markets. read more
""Being able to make tomorrow's bond coupon payment, that definitely lifted risk sentiment overnight and you saw a typical follow-through reaction in risk currencies, so Canadian dollar high, Aussie dollar higher, Kiwi dollar higher - that was kind of an understandable reaction,"" said Erik Bregar, an independent FX analyst in Toronto.
Still, uncertainty remains whether the developer will be able to pay the coupon on its offshore dollar bonds, due on Thursday.
The Australian dollar rose 0.28% versus the greenback at $0.725 after rising as much as 0.49% to $0.7268 while the Canadian dollar rose 0.38% versus the greenback at 1.28 per dollar.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback at 6.4628 per dollar.
All eyes will be on the Fed later in the session for its policy announcement for signs of when the U.S. central bank plans to begin trimming its monthly asset purchases as well as any insight into the timing of a possible rate hike.
""There is definitely a more clear consensus going into this meeting, vis-a-vis the previous one, people are looking for a more clear timeline on taper, we have all heard these expectations about a signal to start in November then the actual pace of purchase start declining in September, you could argue expectations are a tad hawkish coming in,"" Bregar said.
The dollar index fell 0.07%, with the euro up 0.09% to $1.1734.
The safe-haven Japanese yen weakened 0.27% versus the greenback at 109.51 per dollar in the wake of the Bank of Japan's decision to keep policy on hold. read more
Sterling was last trading at $1.3643, down 0.12% on the day ahead of a policy announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday, with expectations for a rate hike being pushed down the road by investors.

Graeme Jennings/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo
Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will release research ""soon"" examining the costs and benefits of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.
""We're working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form,"" Powell said in a news conference following the conclusion of the U.S. central bank'slatest two-day policy meeting.
The ultimate test that will apply when assessing a CBDC, he told reporters, is if there are ""clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks.""
The Fed chief said the discussion paper, announced in May, will tackle some of the public policy issues that could be addressed with a CBDC.
The central bank is also doing other research on the topic, including a multi-year research project the Boston Fed is undertaking with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to explore the technology that could be used for a CBDC. The Fed will also seek input on the issue from the public and from elected officials, Powell said.
A digital currency issued by the central bank would be different from cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are decentralized and can fluctuate wildly in value. While the exact structure hasn't been decided, a CBDC could give the person or business who holds it a direct claim on the central bank, the same as with physical cash.
Fed officials appear divided on the need for a CBDC. While some, including Fed Governor Lael Brainard, say the United States should be a leader in the area at a time when other large economies such as China are moving more aggressively, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles and others are more skeptical that the benefits will outweigh the costs.
""So bottom line, we haven't made a decision,"" Powell said on Wednesday.

Markets focused on timeline for tapering of bond purchases
Fed's Powell to hold news conference
WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to clear the way on Wednesday for reductions to its monthly asset purchases later this year and show in updated projections whether higher-than-expected inflation or a resurgent coronavirus pandemic is weighing more on the economic outlook.
Fed policymakers, who are wrapping up their latest two-day meeting, have been handed a conflicting set of developments since late July - signs of a slowdown in the service sector, a COVID-19 surge that has eclipsed that of last summer and weak job growth in August, all alongside still strong inflation - and been conflicted among themselves about how to react.
Officials have for the most part said the economic recovery will continue and allow the U.S. central bank to proceed with plans to reduce its $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by the end of 2021, and wind them down fully over the first half of next year.
But forecasters and outside analysts expect the Fed to hedge on exactly when the ""taper"" might begin, and tie it to a rebound in job growth following the disconcertingly tepid report in August, when only 235,000 jobs were created. read more
The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), with Fed Chair Jerome Powell holding a news conference half an hour later to discuss the outcome.
The statement will likely acknowledge that the economy has taken another step towards the ""substantial further progress"" the Fed has said it wants to see in the labor market before reducing its bond purchases, Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons said in an analysis. While August job growth was disappointing, U.S. nonfarm payrolls swelled by just over 1 million in July and have increased an average 716,000 since May.
Reuters Graphics
Still, high-frequency data and alternate employment indicators have hinted that upcoming jobs gains may disappoint as well read more , and the Jefferies analysts said the first actual reduction in asset purchases will likely be ""conditional on a solid September employment gain.""
The U.S. job market remains about 5.3 million positions short of where it was before the pandemic.
More then 60% of economists who responded to a Reuters poll said they expected the tapering of the bond purchases to begin in December. read more
Fed officials, however, may decide they need more time to assess the risk from a handful of evolving issues before deciding to push ahead with the reduction in the bond-buying program. Financial markets have been roiled in the last week by concerns about spillover effects from the potential collapse of a large Chinese property developer, China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), and the S&P 500 index (.SPX) kicked off the week with its largest daily loss in four months. read more
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers appear no closer to resolving a partisan standoff in Congress over lifting the federal debt ceiling, with the potential for a partial shutdown of the federal government rising by the day.
INFLATION WATCH
When the bond-buying taper does come, it will mark the start of a shift away from the measures put in place in March 2020 to help the economy through the pandemic, and towards more normal monetary policies that will eventually include higher interest rates.
Powell, who is likely to learn before the Fed's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting whether President Joe Biden wants to nominate him for a second term as head of the central bank, has emphasized in several high-profile speeches, including at a Kansas City Fed research conference last month, that the eventual start of the bond-buying taper is unrelated to the debate over interest rates. It is a point he is likely to reiterate on Wednesday.
Policymakers' new economic and interest rate projections, however, will provide some sense of how fast rate hikes may follow the taper, and in particular whether a bout of high inflation has officials penciling in an initial increase for next year.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation as of July was about 4.2% on an annualized basis. That is double the central bank's 2% target and enough in the minds of some officials to meet the central bank's new promise to let inflation run moderately above that target for a while to be sure it is reached on average, a precursor to raising rates.
Reuters Graphics
Leaning in the other direction: The surge of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
Since June, when the Fed noted the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccinations and said the economy's performance appeared to be separating from the pandemic, the seven-day average of new daily infections had ballooned five-fold to 66,000 by the central bank's July 27-28 meeting. It has roughly doubled again since then.
Some measures of service activity have dipped, prompting forecasters to mark down their outlooks for economic growth this year.
The Fed may well follow suit.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the debt problems of property developer Evergrande seem particular to China and that he did not see a parallel with the U.S. corporate sector.
A potential default by Evergrande (3333.HK), Asia's biggest junk-bond issuer, drove a steep selloff on Wall Street and widened spreads on U.S. high-yield bonds on Monday, although markets have steadied since then. read more
""In terms of the implications for us, there's not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed, but you would worry it would affect global financial conditions through global confidence channels and that kind of thing,"" Powell told reporters after the Fed's policy meeting. ""But I wouldn't draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.""
He added that with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year, the Fed was concerned about a wave of defaults by highly leveraged companies, noting that did not materialize to a significant extent because of the U.S. CARES Act and action by the central bank. Currently, corporate default rates are ""very, very low,"" he said.
As for Evergrande, Powell said China has very high debt for an emerging market economy and that its government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.
Evergrande on Wednesday said it agreed to settle interest payments on a domestic bond, while the Chinese central bank injected cash into the banking system, temporarily soothing investors' fears of imminent contagion that had pressured equities and other riskier assets at the start of the week. read more

Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may not be able to shield the economy and financial markets from the effects of a U.S. debt default, the central bank's chief said on Wednesday as he urged Congress to raise the country's debt limit to avoid that catastrophic risk.
“It’s just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills as and when they come due,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said. “The failure to do that could result in severe damage to the economy and financial markets, and it’s just not something we should contemplate.”
Asked at a press conference following the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting if the central bank is dusting off an emergency response to a U.S. default first devised about a decade ago, Powell said: ""No one should assume the Fed or anyone else can fully protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure.""
U.S. lawmakers in Congress are at loggerheads over the federal government's $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.
The Senate could see a vote next week on raising Washington's borrowing authority and keeping the government funded, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat said on Wednesday, with a House Democrat warning Republican opposition could lead to a historic default on the nation's debt. read more
Failing to raise or suspend it by Sept. 30 could trigger a third partial shutdown of the federal government in the past decade. Failure to do so by mid-October could lead to a far-more disastrous and first-ever U.S. debt default that could plunge the United States into recession and cause lasting damage to the economy.
Republicans oppose any increase as part of a pressure campaign to force Democrats to slim President Joe Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion domestic spending package. Democrats say the debt ceiling debate has nothing to do with the Biden administration's agenda. read more
Powell declined to say whether he had liaised with Treasury Department officials or lawmakers about contingency plans. The nation faced a similar debt ceiling scare in 2013, and at the time Fed policymakers - including Powell, then just a Fed board member - mapped out potential responses to counter stress in financial markets. read more
The blueprint covered a litany of actions the Fed could take to limit the fallout of any default, including prioritizing payments and expanding its asset purchases to include defaulted Treasuries.
The timing of the current stand off over the issue could not be worse for the Fed in that regard. At their two-day meeting ended Wednesday, officials agreed a slowdown in the current purchase pace of $120 billion a month of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities ""may soon be warranted"" given ongoing improvements in the economy and progress toward its goals of price stability and maximum employment. read more

SINGAPORE, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Stocks found relief on Wednesday after teetering developer China Evergrande said it would be able to pay a coupon on one of its bonds, easing some market jitters, however, the Federal Reserve's looming policy decision kept investors cautious.
China fell on its first day of trade after a two-day holiday. However, a cash injection from the People's Bank of China kept falls far smaller than feared with blue chips (.CSI300) off 0.7% and Shanghai Composite (.SSEC) reversing losses to trade up 0.3%.
That weighed on MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS), which fell 0.3%, however, Australia (.AXJO) was higher.
Japan's Nikkei dropped 0.6%. Hong Kong markets were shut.
Evergrande's main unit, Hengda Real Estate, said it had settled interest payments due Thursday on a yuan bond with investors, which helped lift sentiment and trim losses. read more
""I think the market is still a little bit cagey,"" said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific head of research at ING in Singapore.
""It's Evergrande today, who will it be tomorrow? That's probably why we haven't seen a substantial and perhaps prolonged rally as a result of this,"" he said.
The news sent S&P 500 futures , U.S. Treasury yields and the Australian dollar higher, before shedding some of those gains as traders were left with few details and as Evergrande made no mention of dollar bond interest also due on Thursday.
S&P 500 futures were last up 0.2%. European futures inched up 0.3%. After rising, safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasury yields eased back to flat at 1.3311%.
Globally, markets had also already started to calm as analysts downplayed the threat of Evergrande's troubles becoming a ""Lehman moment"" and setting off a financial crisis.
European markets rallied on Tuesday and on Wall Street the S&P 500 (.SPX) fared little worse than flat, sitting about 4% below a record made early in the month.
Focus now seems to be shifting to trying to gauge Beijing's so-far muted response amid worries about the consequences for an economy that is slowing and financial markets reeling from months of disruptive and radical reform.
""(The) Evergrande debacle is further stoking concern over the fallout from China's broadening crackdown,"" analysts at Rabobank said in a note to clients, pointing out new rules on everything from online gaming to developers debt levels.
""As a consequence, Evergrande can perhaps be seen not so much as a potential crisis trigger but rather a symptom of a broader policy shift which threatens Chinese growth as politics dominate economic considerations.""
In currency markets, the Aussie rose slightly, having given up some of its early-session blip while the safe-haven yen was a tad weaker.
Moves were capped ahead of Wednesday's Fed meeting, however, and the dollar was flat against the euro, with the risk of a hawkish Fed supporting the dollar.
Most analysts think the Fed will not go into detail about its tapering plans but say risks lie in board members' ""dot plot"" of rates projections. read more
""Even though a tapering announcement is not expected, the dot plot may deliver a hawkish surprise and require Powell to be dovish and push back in the press conference,"" said National Australia Bank's director of economics and markets Tapas Strickland.
The outcome of the Fed's meeting is announced at 1800 GMT with a news conference half an hour later.
In commodities, copper hovered near a month low and oil prices found support from a relaxation of inbound travel rules, likely to boost airline fuel demand.
Brent crude futures were last up 1% at $75.13 a barrel and U.S. crude rose 1.1% to $71.28. Gold was supported at $1,776.1 an ounce.

Stocks edged higher on Wall Street in morning trading Wednesday ahead of an anticipated update from the Federal Reserve on how and when it might begin easing its extraordinary support measures for the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 0.8% as of 10:02 a.m. Eastern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 332 points, or 1%, to 34,252 and the Nasdaq rose 0.5%.
Gains within the S&P 500 were broad and could potentially break a four-day losing streak if they hold. Roughly 85% of stocks in the index rose. Banks and technology companies led the gains. A mix of health care and communications companies fell.
Smaller stocks did slightly better than the broader market. The Russell 2000 rose 1.1%.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.32%. Crude oil prices rose 1.7%.
Much of the weakness for communications companies came from Facebook. The social media company fell 4.2% after its oversight board said it will review an internal system that exempted high-profile users from some or all of its rules.
FedEx slumped 8.4% after it reported sharply higher costs even as demand for shipping increased. A wide range of industrial and other companies have been dealing with higher costs because of a mix of labor and supply chain problems.
Investors’ key focus on Wednesday is the Fed’s statement on interest rate policy. The central bank has been buying bonds to keep interest rates low since the pandemic sapped the economy 18 months ago. It has signaled that it will eventually reduce those purchases, but the breadth and timing is still unknown.
Wall Street has been trying to gauge how the slowdown in the economic recovery will affect the Fed’s decision-making process. The broader market has been choppy as that question lingers amid rising cases of COVID-19 because of the highly contagious delta variant.
Investors have also been concerned about heavily indebted Chinese real estate developers and the damage they could do if they default and send ripple effects through markets. Evergrande, one of China’s biggest private sector conglomerates, said it will make a payment due Thursday, potentially easing some of those concerns.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Half of Federal Reserve policymakers now expect to start raising interest rates next year and think rates should rise to at least 1% by the end of 2023, reflecting a growing consensus that gradually tighter policy will be needed to keep inflation in check.
The swifter pace of interest rate hikes from policymakers' last set of projections in June comes amid the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history after a brief recession last year and robust debate at the Fed about balancing its maximum employment and 2% average inflation goals.
The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight lending rate in the current target range of 0% to 0.25%, where it has remained since March 2020 when the U.S. economy was buffeted by the onset of the pandemic.
The new economic projections released alongside the policy statement showed nine of 18 Fed policymakers now foresee a liftoff in interest rates next year, compared to seven in June. All but one saw at least one interest rate needed by the end of 2023, and nine saw the need to target rates at least as high as between 1% and 1.25% by then.
By 2024, the median rate forecast was for 1.8% - still below the 2.5% level they estimate neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth over the long run and therefore broadly accommodative of further job gains. That's despite policymakers' forecast for inflation to remain above the Fed's 2% target through 2024.
Combined, it's new fodder for understanding how the Fed intends to carry out its new policy framework, under which it will aim for inflation to remain moderately above its 2% target for ""some time.""
U.S. gross domestic product at the median is projected to grow 5.9% this year and 3.8% in 2022, compared to forecasts in June of 7.0% in 2021 and 3.3% next year.
The unemployment rate is seen falling to 4.8% this year and to 3.8% in 2022.
The pace of price increases is expected to rise to 4.2% this year, higher than forecast in June, although Fed policymakers see it declining to 2.2% in 2022 and 2.1% by 2024.

WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Federal Reserve could do without the latest arguments in Washington about the U.S. government’s borrowing limit. Failure to agree could leave Uncle Sam unable to pay its bills. If lawmakers allow any debt to go unpaid, the central bank would be in a seriously tough spot.
Congress is once again playing a game of chicken. The $28 trillion borrowing limit went back into effect in August. If lawmakers don’t increase it soon, the government won’t be able to pay its bills starting sometime in October. Eventually, that could result in an actual debt default. The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a measure to suspend the debt ceiling again through 2022. But that plan would require support from Senate Republicans, who have vowed to reject it.
The worst-case scenario is something the Fed has considered before. To contain a default, the central bank discussed accepting delinquent Treasuries as collateral for loans or even buying them in 2011 and 2013, when the debt limit was also in limbo, according to Reuters. Such measures would amount to enabling the government’s default while also, in effect, bailing out reckless lawmakers. That would make the Fed’s claim of political independence almost untenable. Back in 2013, then-Governor Jerome Powell, now the Fed chair, summed it up when he said the options were “loathsome.”
Even if the standoff gets nowhere near a default, the central bank could still be in an awkward spot. The Treasury would have to stop paying bills, including perhaps Social Security payments to retirees. The fiscal tensions could also bring a spike in interest rates, which would make mortgages and car loans more expensive. Meanwhile, the economic recovery from Covid-19 still faces speed bumps and the central bank is trying to gauge when to scale back its ongoing support, with the latest policy update expected on Wednesday.
The debt ceiling has already become a political football. It was a key reason why Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating in 2011. It makes no sense for lawmakers to try to block already agreed spending by limiting the borrowing to pay for it. Yet some might be willing to take the risk of provoking a default. That would be potentially catastrophic for the U.S. economy – and also for the Fed.

CONTEXT NEWS
- The U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee is set to announce its latest monetary policy moves on Sept. 22. One area of focus is when the committee will reduce its purchases of $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities each month, a program that began in 2020 in response to the economic effects of the pandemic.
- Separately, the House of Representatives on Sept. 21 approved a measure to suspend the federal government’s borrowing limit until the end of 2022. The ceiling, suspended since 2019, went back into effect on Aug. 1, and a failure to increase it will leave the federal government unable to pay all of its bills starting sometime in October. The plan moves to the Senate, where Republicans have vowed to block it.
- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that a government default on its debt obligations would result in a “permanently weaker nation.” In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 19, she urged Congress to raise or suspend the current borrowing limit of about $28.4 trillion.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the Fed is closely monitoring efforts by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to fix its ""widespread and pervasive"" problems, and that it would take appropriate actions if the bank failed to do so.
In 2018, the Federal Reserve ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion until it had improved its governance and risk controls following sales practice scandals. That constrains Wells Fargo's ability to make new loans. read more
Powell said on Wednesday that the bank's asset cap would stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems, suggesting the bank had a ways to go before it would be allowed to expand in size.
""We're not going to remove that asset cap until that's done,"" he said.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the bank $250 million for failing to properly pay back wronged customers as directed in a 2018 consent order. read more
The OCC also placed new restrictions on the bank's ability to expand its mortgage servicing business until it had addressed those shortcomings. At the time, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said the bank was still working on addressing ""significant, longstanding deficiencies.""
On Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was closely monitoring the bank's efforts to address its numerous issues, and would not hesitate to impose fresh penalties if it fails to meet its expectations.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo
Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday he was displeased with the active investing carried out by two Fed regional bank presidents and pledged the central bank's ethics rules will be tightened after a thorough review.
""We need to make changes and we are going to do that,"" Powell said at a televised press conference after the Fed's latest policy meeting.
Though rules limiting the trading activities of Fed policymakers are somewhat stricter than those for government employees generally, the current framework is ""now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public’s trust.""
Asked if he still trusted Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren to do their jobs, Powell said, ""In terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think, no one is happy. No one on the (Federal Open Market Committee) is happy to have these questions raised.""
His comments come amid criticism of the two officials and public calls for their resignation following revelations they traded actively in stocks and other investments last year, when millions of Americans lost their jobs and the Fed was taking historic steps to bolster financial markets and the economy.
Both Kaplan and Rosengren have said their ethics officers had signed off on their trading, but have since pledged to divest their holdings by the end of this month to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Their spokesmen declined to comment after Powell's remarks Wednesday.
Powell said he had not been aware of their trading activities before they were reported earlier this month by the Wall Street Journal and others.
Powell was also asked about his own holdings, which include municipal securities like those the Fed bought last year as part of efforts to stave off a financial market collapse. Powell said that he had owned them for years and was not an active trader.
""Munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because as you know the lore was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities,"" he said.
But then the crisis hit and the Fed began backstopping vast swaths of the financial markets. Powell said he checked with the office of government ethics which found he did not have a conflict.
Powell said he was ""reluctant to get ahead of the process"" and signal what changes might be ahead.
""When we have things to announce we will go ahead and do that,"" he said.

NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was choppy on the heels of the latest policy announcement by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, while risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar and Chinese yuan strengthened after China's Evergrande said it would make a bond coupon payment.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cleared the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected, with half of the 18 U.S. central bank policymakers projecting borrowing costs will need to rise in 2022. read more
""The tapering of quantitative easing seems very likely now in November but this was something of a given and remains couched in a lot of qualifying criteria in the event that various risks emerge, whether it is the debt ceiling debate, COVID outlook, the China property market intervening,"" said Steven Violin, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management Company in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
The dollar index rose 0.094%, alternating between gains and declines after the announcement, with the euro down 0.1% to $1.1711.
Property giant and Asia's biggest junk bond issuer Evergrande (3333.HK) said it ""resolved"" one payment due on Thursday via a private negotiation, easing concerns of default and possible contagion risk, while the People's Bank of China injected 90 billion yuan into the banking system to support markets. read more
""Being able to make tomorrow's bond coupon payment, that definitely lifted risk sentiment overnight and you saw a typical follow-through reaction in risk currencies, so Canadian dollar high, Aussie dollar higher, Kiwi dollar higher - that was kind of an understandable reaction,"" said Erik Bregar, an independent FX analyst in Toronto.
Still, uncertainty remains whether the developer will be able to pay the coupon on its offshore dollar bonds, due on Thursday.
The Australian dollar rose 0.33% versus the greenback to $0.726 after rising as much as 0.49% to $0.7268 while the Canadian dollar rose 0.58% versus the greenback to 1.27 per dollar.
The offshore Chinese yuan strengthened versus the greenback to 6.4628 per dollar.
The safe-haven Japanese yen weakened 0.50% versus the greenback to 109.78 per dollar in the wake of the Bank of Japan's decision to keep policy on hold. read more
Sterling was last trading at $1.3637, down 0.16% on the day ahead of a policy announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday, with expectations for a rate hike being pushed down the road by investors.
In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin last rose 6.93% to $43,409.48 following three straight days of declines.

Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve could wrap up the tapering of its bond purchases by the middle of next year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.
Powell's remark came at the beginning of his press conference following the release of the Fed's latest policy statement in which it said ""a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted"" but made no reference to how long that process may take. The Fed has been buying $120 billion a month of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to support the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

The Aussie was a shade firmer at $0.7241, having found support at $0.7220, though it needs to get above $0.7283 resistance to be out of immediate danger.
The kiwi dollar also edged up to $0.7019, after finding bids at $0.6994. It faces resistance at $0.7040 and $0.7060.
Both drew some relief in news embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande would make a coupon payment on its domestic bonds on Sept. 23, calming fears of an imminent default.
Concerns about the viability of the heavily indebted group have weighed on equities and commodities, and pressured the Aussie which is often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk.
“The Aussie dollar is still vulnerable to a further worsening of risk sentiment, although we think that the Chinese authorities will manage to avoid a full-blown financial crisis,” said Jonathan Petersen, a market economist at Capital Economics.
“As a result, we forecast a moderate fall in the Aussie to $0.7000 by the end of this year.”
The immediate direction will be set by the Fed with the market assuming it will discuss tapering but put off an actual announcement to October or November.
The danger for the Aussie could be in the “dot plot” forecasts from Fed members which might show the median timing of the first rate hike has shifted to 2022 from 2023.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) remains adamant that its rates are likely to stay at 0.1% until 2024, which is why local 10-year bond yields trade five basis points below Treasuries at 1.28%.
Both are set to be way behind the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) which is considered almost certain to raise its rates early next month.
Markets are fully priced for a move of 25 basis points to 0.5%, though they scaled back wagers on a half-point hike following a speech from RBNZ Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby on Tuesday.
The RBNZ has not raised interest rates by 50 basis points since 2000 when they were up at 6.0%.
While 10-year yields eased a touch to 1.89%, they remain 56 basis points above Treasuries. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-forex/australia-nz-dollars-try-to-find-a-floor-as-fed-risk-looms-idUSL4N2QO0YZ

Although investors seemed to have factored in the news, it did not have enough power to send the Nikkei above 30,000 levels, said Shigetoshi Kamada, general manager at the research department of Tachibana Securities.
“That is because investor focus is on the Fed meeting... how the interest rate projections will look like and whether the Fed will start tapering before the end of the year,” he said.

Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.5%. Equity, bond and currency markets in China open for the first time on Wednesday since concern over Evergrande’s predicament triggered a wave of selling and contagion worries around the world.
Singapore-traded FTSE China futures are about 2% below Friday’s closing level. Safe-haven assets such as the yen and U.S. Treasuries rose slightly in morning trade.
Globally, markets have calmed following a sharp selloff on Monday, as analysts have downplayed the threat of Evergrande’s troubles becoming a “Lehman moment” and setting off a financial crisis. But stocks have scarcely bounced and commodities remain under pressure as concern shifts to the economic consequences.

Evergrande - as expected - missed interest payments due Monday to at least two of its largest bank creditors, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The next test looms on Thursday when the firm is due to pay $83.5 million in interest on bonds -- failure to do so within 30 days would put the bonds in default.
The firm’s distress has already spread to other developers, and an index of high-yield Chinese corporate debt - predominantly issued by property firms - has crumbled. But investors are now anticipating some sort of regulatory response from Beijing and hoping global fallout can be contained.
