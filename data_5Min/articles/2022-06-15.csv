0,How Does Increasing Interest Rates Help With Inflation?,2022-06-15T17:17:44Z,"The largest interest rate hike in 28 years, three-quarters of a percentage point, was announced by the Federal Reserve as it tries to rein in surging prices.","The Federal Reserve announcedits largest interest rate hike in 28 years on Wednesday in an attempt to battle the nation's continuing surge in inflation. Financial experts have said the key to this strategy is supply and demand.
The Federal Reserve—the nation's central bank, commonly called ""the Fed""—increased interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point. The move comes after the government released new numbers for the consumer price index that showed annual inflation moderated in April. However, the index increased at an annual rate of 8.3 percent, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last Friday that inflation rose 8.6 percent from a year ago, the fastest increase since 1981.
The Fed's plan, which was announced to the media by Chairman Jerome Powell, is to raise short-term interest rates to battle inflation. When discussing rising inflation, many experts point to the positive growth seen in the economy: More people have more money, but there are too few goods to buy. This results in a rise in prices.
For a better explanation of why the Fed is raising interest rates, The New York Times consulted with two experts for a story the newspaper ran on Tuesday. One was Kathy Jones, the chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, and the other was Edmund Phelps, a Columbia University economist. They explained that the Fed is seeking to restore a balance in supply and demand with an increase in interest rates by making it more expensive to borrow money.
In other words, the Fed's hope is that people will be discouraged from spending their money because of higher interest rates, which will decrease demand and eventually lower inflation.
One example discussed in the Times was the recent rise in mortgage rates. While this makes it more expensive to buy a house, inflation may not be affected in the short term because of the high demand for houses, a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While the Fed's interest rate increase can't address a housing shortage, higher rates could eventually address the relationship between supply and demand in a year or more, because fewer people will be taking on new mortgages.
""By raising rates, the Fed is trying to make you slow down your spending. That happens when the cost of money goes up for a car loan or mortgage or something else you want to spend money on,"" Jones told the Times. ""The higher cost of money reduces your purchasing power—what you can afford to buy—and the Fed is effectively making you buy less. And that should bring down inflation.""
Phelps said the current economic situation is a result of ""aggregate demand exceeding supply, and that's causing prices to rise."" Therefore, he said, the Fed is trying to ""clamp down on demand"" by raising interest rates.
Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, told CNBC that he thinks the interest rate hike may not be enough to address inflation.
""Can the Fed bring down inflation on their own? I think the answer is 'no,'"" Baird told the business news outlet. ""They certainly can help rein in the demand side by higher interest rates. But it's not going to unload container ships, it's not going to reopen production capacity in China, it's not going to hire the long-haul truckers we need to get things across the country.""
However, Baird noted that ""the Fed has been reasonably successful in convincing markets that they have their eye on the ball and long-term inflation expectations have been held in check.""
He added, ""As we look forward, that will continue to be the primary focus. It's something that we're watching very closely, to make sure that investors don't lose faith in [the central bank's] ability to keep a lid on long-term inflation.""
Update 6/15/22, 3 p.m. ET: This story was updated with the Federal Reserve's announcement of its 0.75 percent interest rate hike.",https://www.newsweek.com/how-does-increasing-interest-rates-help-inflation-1716144
1,"U.S. Federal Reserve hikes target interest rate by 0.75 percentage point, flags slowing economy",2022-06-15T17:05:21Z,The rate hike was the biggest made by the U.S. central bank since 1994,"The Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday to stem a disruptive surge in inflation, and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come.
The rate hike was the biggest made by the U.S. central bank since 1994, and was delivered after recent data showed little progress in its inflation battle.
U.S. central bank officials flagged a faster path of increases in borrowing costs to come as well, more closely aligning monetary policy with a rapid shift this week in financial market views of what it will take to bring price pressures under control.
“Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures,” the central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement at the end of its latest two-day meeting in Washington. “The committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.”
The statement continued to cite the Ukraine war and China lockdown policies as sources of inflation.
The action raised the short-term federal funds rate to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%, and Fed officials at the median projected the rate increasing to 3.4% by the end of this year and to 3.8% in 2023 - a substantial shift from projections in March that saw the rate rising to 1.9% this year.
The stricter monetary policy was accompanied with a downgrade to the Fed’s economic outlook, with the economy now seen slowing to a below-trend 1.7% rate of growth this year, unemployment rising to 3.7% by the end of this year, and continuing to rise to 4.1% through 2024.
While no policymaker projected an outright recession, the range of economic growth forecasts edged toward zero in 2023 and the federal funds rate was seen falling in 2024.
The projections are a break with recent Fed efforts to cast tighter monetary policy and inflation control as consistent with steady and low unemployment. The 4.1% jobless rate seen in 2024 is now slightly above the level Fed officials generally see as consistent with full employment.
Since March, when Fed officials projected they could raise rates and control inflation with the unemployment rate remaining around 3.5%, inflation has stubbornly remained at a 40-year high, with no sign of it reaching the peak Fed policymakers hoped would arrive this spring.
Even with the more aggressive interest rate measures taken on Wednesday, policymakers nevertheless see inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index at 5.2% through this year and slowing only gradually to 2.2% in 2024.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George was the only policymaker to dissent in Wednesday’s decision in preference for a half-percentage-point hike.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the latest policy meeting.
Inflation has become the most pressing economic issue for the Fed and has begun to shape the political landscape as well, with household sentiment worsening amid rising food and gasoline prices.

2,The Fed hasn't announced a 75-point-hike in nearly 30 years,2022-06-15T16:56:25Z,"The last time the Federal Reserve raised rates by 75 basis points was in 1994, when Alan Greenspan brought the US economy down for a soft landing. This time, though, the Fed finds itself in very different conditions.","The last time the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points, a Democratic president was in the second year of his term, the stock market had just enjoyed a buoyant couple of years, and a Tom Cruise movie was in the theaters. Not so different from now—except that it was 1994, no one was worrying about a recession, and there was no inflation to speak of.
In November 1994, Alan Greenspan, the then-chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced a rate hike from 4.75% to 5.5%. Under Greenspan, the Fed had been slowly tightening the screws, after leaving rates untouched throughout 1993. From 3.25% in January 1994, the rates crept up all year, until they leaped those 75 basis points in November.
To observers, and particularly to the Clinton White House, these moves were befuddling. Inflation was at its lowest in two decades, hovering around 2.7%, but with market indices thriving, Greenspan thought he felt the first licks of warmth from a heating economy. He was such a hawk that he favored raising rates preemptively—to the point, his critics said, of not allowing the economy to flourish. “Sometimes, when Greenspan was due to come over to the White House, the president would entertain his advisers with an imitation of the Fed chairman: a cheerless old man droning on about inflation,” wrote Sebastian Mallaby, Greenspan’s biographer. When Greenspan proposed the 75-basis-point hike to his colleagues, Mallaby added, “it was as though Greenspan had listened to [speaker Newt] Gingrich and Clinton wax lyrical about the economy’s potential and had resolved to pick a fight with both of them.”
The soft landing of 1994
In retrospect, economists think that Greenspan’s tightening brought the US down into a soft landing—a cooling of the markets that avoids the kind of recession often triggered by sharp, sudden rises in interest rates. Despite another rate increase by 50 basis points in February 1995, the Dow Jones rose more than 33% over the course of that year, showing that the economy’s spirits were unaffected by Greenspan’s great hike. Inflation stayed mild. We will never know the counterfactual, of course; prices may have remained low anyway, thanks to the efficiencies of rapid globalization, and Greenspan may have nipped a larger economic boom in the bud. But as the phrase goes: no harm, no foul.
Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, finds himself in a very different position. He is trying to fight already blazing fires with respect to both inflation, which has risen to 8.6%, and the plunging in the stock market. Fears of a recession abound, in large part because everyone expects the Fed will hit the brakes hard very soon to tame prices. Powell wants a soft landing as well. Unlike Greenspan in 1994, though, he is already feeling turbulence.",https://qz.com/2178185/the-fed-hasnt-announced-a-75-point-hike-in-nearly-30-years/

4,Rising prices may turn Fed into reluctant villain,2022-06-15T16:21:59Z,"The nice-guy central banker has no place in a world of high inflation. Consumer prices in the United States jumped by a forecast-busting 8.6% in May, year-over-year.

Consumer prices in the United States jumped by a forecast-busting 8.6% in May, year-over-year. Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell now has little choice but to go bigger on rate hikes, inflicting more pain on people already struggling with high food and gas prices. Doing so is long-term rational, and short-term villainous.
Friday’s inflation numbers punctured the theory – borne out by economists surveyed by Reuters – that prices had steadied in May. Instead, they jumped to their highest level since 1981. Grocery costs rose even more than the headline number with a nearly 12% year-on-year increase, the Labor Department said on Friday. Gas, the life-blood of the U.S. economy, was up almost 49% from a year ago.
Powell’s only option is to hurt Americans more. Last month, he essentially ruled out rate increases of more than 0.5 percentage points at a time. With inflation surging rather than receding read more , he may have to consider larger hikes – say, three-quarters of a percentage point – that will make credit-card balances and mortgages more expensive, and possibly tip the economy into a recession.

Consumers were already in distress read more . An index that measures mortgage-application volumes fell to its lowest level in 22 years because of higher borrowing rates, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday. Households are spending an extra $341 a month to purchase the same goods and services as they did a year ago, according to Moody’s Analytics.
Paul Volcker’s example might offer some solace for Powell. Central bank chief from 1979 to 1987, Volcker took on inflation that had hit 13.5% the year after he was appointed and doubled interest rates to nearly 20% in just six months. Back-to-back recessions ensued; the unemployment rate hit almost 11% in 1982. Some lawmakers proposed impeaching Volcker. But a year later, inflation was down to 3.2%, and the economy boomed thereafter.
Powell likely won’t have to make as big of a move on rates, but hiking them in larger increments will still harm average Americans. And it’s unclear how much influence monetary policy will have given the surge in food and gas prices is largely due to war in Ukraine. As with Volcker, history may deem Powell a hero – but he is on course to make plenty of enemies in the meantime.

7,Consider Hiding Behind the 2x Long VIX Futures ETF (UVIX) As the Federal Reserve Gears up to Hike Rates by Most Since the 1990s,2022-06-15T15:55:00Z,"UVIX has been one of the best performing instruments so far this year, having recorded gains of over 26 percent since the start of 2022","This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. WCCF TECH INC has a disclosure and ethics policy.
Akin to a calm before the proverbial storm, the benchmark S&P 500 index is in the positive territory at the time of writing ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s momentous FOMC meeting later today, where the apex monetary institution is expected to unleash another barrage of interest rate hikes to try to tame the ongoing inflationary impulse, thereby setting the stage for abnormal volatility. In this uncertain environment, the 2x Long VIX Futures ETF (UVIX) might be the perfect refuge for battered investors.
As a refresher, UVIX aims to provide investors with 2x the daily percentage changes in near-term VIX futures. For the uninitiated, VIX futures are the derivative instruments of the CBOE Volatility Index, colloquially known as the VIX and which acts as the market’s “fear index”. Since UVIX aims to provide double the return generated by VIX futures, it is a levered product, and investors should tread with care in accordance with their respective risk tolerance.

Coming back, as markets crash and volatility increases, VIX futures also increase. Consequently, in an uncertain environment, UVIX can act as a near-perfect refuge for battered investors. On the flip side, due to its levered nature, the instrument can also result in outsized losses relatively quickly.
So, why do we think investors should consider hiding behind UVIX today? Well, for starters, UVIX has been one of the best performing instruments so far this year, having recorded gains of over 26 percent since the start of 2022. For comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 index is down over 21 percent during the same period.
Moreover, as stated earlier, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the Fed Funds rate by a sizable quantum. The snippet above lays down the probability of interest rate hikes that can be expected today. As is evident, the market has virtually locked in a 75 bp (0.75 percent) increase in the Fed Funds rate, with a 100 bp increase also in play. Bear in mind that peculation has been growing over the past few days that the Fed might go full scorch-earth and hike rates by 100 bp or a full percentage. Even if we get a 75 bp increase today, it would still mark the fastest pace of interest rate hikes since the 1990s. All of this uncertainty plays into UVIX’s strengths.
And yes, 100 bps tomorrow, in July and thereafter would be better. The sooner the @federalreserve can get to a terminal FF rate and thereafter can begin to ease, the sooner the markets can recover. https://t.co/lFDNvLl3oU — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) June 14, 2022
Coronavirus Continues to Act as a Dampener on U.S. Economic Growth, as per Federal Reserve’s Latest Beige Book Report
Bear in mind that a rising interest rate environment, particularly when paired with near-term growth concerns, is an anathema for risk assets in general. It is for this reason that equities have had one of the worst starts to the year in a very long time. Nonetheless, there is a section of analysts and high-profile investors who view a potential 100 bp hike by the Fed in a positive light, postulating that the sooner the Fed achieves its terminal interest rate target, the faster markets can calm down. Therefore, there remains a material probability that a market-wide rally might result in the aftermath of the FOMC’s decision, hammering UVIX in the process.
Any rally, if it does materialize, would be short-lived, in our opinion, for the simple matter that the overarching goal of the Fed’s hawkish stance is to curb the ongoing inflationary impulse. And curbing the wealth effect pervading the US economy by hammering risk assets is an integral part of this strategy. Consequently, as long as inflation remains near multi-decadal highs, any relief rally is likely to be met with a much more hawkish commentary from the Fed, thereby strengthening UVIX’s investment thesis for the time being.
It is hardly surprising, therefore, that retail investors are paying attention to UVIX in this uncertain environment. As an illustration, UVIX was mentioned 373 times in comments on the WallStreetBets forum over the past 7 days. For comparison, the QQQ ETF was mentioned 160 times during the same period.

The latest move is only one part of a rate-hiking cycle, which aims to crush inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, as some fear could happen. The Fed last raised rates by 75 basis points in November 1994.
""The motivation for all of this is that prices are going up,"" said Chester Spatt, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. ""The Fed is trying to fight that with higher interest rates to reduce demand.""
For consumers, this aggressive approach could eventually bring relief from surging prices. It also comes at a cost.
What the federal funds rate means to you
The federal funds rate, which is set by the central bank, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate that consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and saving rates they see every day.
""We're certainly going to see the cost of borrowing escalate relatively quickly,"" Spatt said.
With the backdrop of rising rates and future economic uncertainty, there are specific steps consumers should be taking to stabilize their finances — including paying down debt, especially costly credit card and other variable rate debt, and increasing savings, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
Pay down high-rate debt
Since most credit cards have a variable interest rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark, so short-term borrowing rates are already heading higher.
Credit card rates are currently 16.61%, on average, significantly higher than nearly every other consumer loan and may closer to 19% by the end of the year — which would be a new record, according to Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.
If the APR on your credit card rises to 18.61% by the end of 2022, it will cost you another $832 in interest charges over the lifetime of the loan, assuming you made minimum payments on the average $5,525 balance, Rossman calculated.
If you're carrying a balance, try consolidating and paying off high-interest credit cards with a lower interest home equity loan or personal loan or switch to an interest-free balance transfer credit card, he advised.
Consumers with an adjustable-rate mortgage or home equity lines of credit may also want to switch to a fixed rate, Spatt said.
Because longer-term 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy, those homeowners won't be immediately impacted by a rate hike.
However, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is also on the rise, reaching 6.28% this week — up more than three full percentage points from 3.11% at the end of December.
""Given that they've already gone up so dramatically, it's difficult to say just how much higher mortgage rates will go by year's end,"" said Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst at LendingTree.
On a $300,000 loan, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage would cost you about $1,283 a month at a 3.11% rate. If you paid 6.28% instead, that would cost an extra $570 a month or $6,840 more a year and another $205,319 over the lifetime of the loan, according to Grow's mortgage calculator.
Even though auto loans are fixed, payments are getting bigger because the price for all cars is rising, so if you are planning to finance a new car, you'll shell out more in the months ahead.
Federal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers won't be impacted immediately by a rate hike. However, if you have a private loan, those loans may be fixed or have a variable rate tied to the Libor, prime or T-bill rates — which means that as the Fed raises rates, borrowers will likely pay more in interest, although how much more will vary by the benchmark.
That makes this a particularly good time identify the loans you have outstanding and see if refinancing makes sense.
Hunt for higher savings rates
While the Fed has no direct influence on deposit rates, they tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate. As a result, the savings account rate at some of the largest retail banks are barely above rock bottom, currently a mere 0.07%, on average.
""The rates paid by bigger banks are largely unchanged so where you have your savings is really important,"" McBride said.
Thanks, in part, to lower overhead expenses, the average online savings account rate is closer to 1%, much higher than the average rate from a traditional, brick-and-mortar bank.
""If you have money sitting in a savings account earning 0.05%, moving that to a savings account paying 1% is an immediate twentyfold increase with further benefits still to come as interest rates rise,"" according to McBride.
Top-yielding certificates of deposit, which pay about 1.5%, are even better than a high-yield savings account.
However, because the inflation rate is now higher than all of these rates, any money in savings loses purchasing power over time.
To that end, ""one main opportunity out there is the possibility of buying some I bonds from the U.S. government,"" Spatt said.
These inflation-protected assets, backed by the federal government, are nearly risk-free and pay a 9.62% annual rate through October, the highest yield on record.
Although there are purchase limits and you can't tap the money for at least one year, you'll score a much better return than a savings account or a one-year CD.
What's coming next for interest rates
Consumers should prepare for even higher interest rates in the coming months.
Even though the Fed has already raised rates multiple times this year, more hikes are on the horizon as the central bank grapples with inflation.
While expectations for those increases had been quarter and half-point hikes at each meeting, the central bank could hand out further 50 or 75 basis point increases if inflation doesn't start to cool down.

16,Analysis: Battered bulls hope Fed pain in rearview mirror after Powell maps out hikes,2022-06-15T12:56:25Z,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave investors a glimmer of hope that the central bank is unlikely to become more hawkish in coming months, though few see reason for long-term optimism in the face of soaring inflation and fears of slowing growth.","U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during his re-nominations hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., January 11, 2022.

May 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave investors a glimmer of hope that the central bank is unlikely to become more hawkish in coming months, though few see reason for long-term optimism in the face of soaring inflation and fears of slowing growth.
The Fed delivered an expected 50 basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday, but said larger hikes were not on the table among policymakers, allaying some investors’ fears that the central bank would raise rates by 75 basis points in upcoming meetings. read more
The coming weeks will show if markets take the Fed at its word. Plenty of factors could force the Fed into a more aggressive posture, and some investors continue to believe policymakers were initially too slow in reacting to surging inflation and will need to raise rates more than expected.

Still, Powell’s message appeared to fuel the hopes of investors who believe markets may have already priced in the extent of Fed hawkishness for now. The S&P 500 (.SPX) roared to a 2.8% gain on Wednesday, its biggest since May 2020, while Treasuries also rallied. read more
“I think the pain is mostly behind us,” said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist at Allspring Global. Powell “took 75 bps off the table and already talked up how core inflation is looking better, which could lower the path of rate hikes.”
Expectations of a hawkish Fed have weighed heavily on markets this year. The S&P is down 10.7% from its highs following an 8.8% drop in April, the worst monthly decline since March 2020. The ICE BoFA US Treasury Index is down 8.2% to its lowest level since May 2019. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points in March, its first hike since 2018, and the market is pricing in some 191 basis points of tightening for the year. FEDWATCH
Some market participants believe Powell’s comments – which envisaged 50-basis-point hikes each in June and July, potentially the steepest increases in the Fed funds rate since 1994 – showed the Fed has grown as hawkish as it's likely to get for the time being.
“At this stage, we believe the Fed has pivoted to an appropriately hawkish stance and is likely done surprising markets for a while. We recommend focusing more on the data flow going forward, especially around labor and inflation,” analysts at BoFA Global Research wrote.
Investors will get a look at April inflation data next week; the March numbers showed consumer prices growing at their fastest clip in nearly four decades. Signs that inflation is continuing to exceed market expectations could erode confidence in the Fed’s outlook and weaken asset prices.
""Of course, whether today ultimately marks the 'peak hawkishness' moment... depends on the data, particularly the inflation data,"" wrote analysts at Natwest including Brian Daingerfield.
For bulls, history may offer some hope, according to data from Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. The S&P 500 has rallied back in 12 of the 21 instances since 1980 when it fell by double-digits in a single year, ending those years with a hefty average gain of 17%, the data showed.
Some, however, saw few reasons for optimism, as markets still face issues including geopolitical uncertainty and sky-high commodity prices stemming from the war in Ukraine.
“At least for today investors had a reason to come back to some parts of the equity market, but you haven’t really solved any issues that are plaguing markets,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “All Powell really did was take extreme measures off the table for now.”
Samana remains underweight in small-cap equities, emerging market stocks, and industrial and financial stocks that benefit from sustained economic growth in anticipation of higher interest rates softening the economy.
And although Powell said he was confident the Fed could tame inflation without pushing the economy into recession, some investors remained doubtful the central bank could engineer a so-called soft landing.
“They’ve started too late in addressing inflation and we all know this, and the question is whether they will make a mistake the other way,” said Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager for the Osterweis Total Return Fund, which has its largest overweights in mortgages and corporate bonds.
“Today’s market reaction is one of relief,"" he said, ""but tomorrow’s could be different once we move past the idea that the worst possible decision is off the table.”

June 15 (UPI) -- As the Federal Reserve is expected to hike interest rates on Wednesday -- possibly by as much as three-quarters of a point -- mortgage demand in the United States is up, according to an industry report. The Mortgage Bankers Association said in its weekly report that overall applications are up about 6.6% for the week -- but are way down compared to this same time last year. Advertisement
Total mortgage applications, the MBA said, are down 53% over the past 12 months.
""Mortgage rates increased for all loan types, with the 30-year fixed rate last week jumping 25 basis points to 5.65% -- the highest level since 2008,"" MBA Associate Vice President of Forecasting Joel Kan said in a statement.
""Mortgage rates followed Treasury yields up in response to higher-than-expected inflation and anticipation that the Federal Reserve will need to raise rates at a faster pace.""
The Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Most analysts think the Fed will order a three-quarter-point rate increase, which would be the largest since 1994.
""Despite the increase in rates, application activity rebounded following the Memorial Day holiday week but remained 0.29% below pre-holiday levels,"" Kan added. ""With mortgage rates well above 5%, refinance activity continues to run more than 70% lower than last year.""

19,Why federal reserve hikes interest rates to fight inflation,2022-06-15T12:30:00Z,"Changing the interest rate is the Fed's only major tool to fight inflation, but it's a blunt instrument that some fear could push the U.S. into a recession.","The rate hike would hopefully curb inflation, but some investors fear it could push the U.S. into a recession.
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is expected Wednesday to announce its largest interest rate hike since 1994 — a bigger increase than it had previously signaled and a sign that the central bank is struggling to restrain stubbornly high inflation.
The central bank is considered likely to raise its benchmark short-term rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, far larger than the typical quarter-point increase, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. It will also likely forecast additional large rate hikes through the end of the year.
A series of sizeable increases would heighten borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, likely leading to an economic slowdown and raising the risk of a recession. The Fed's previous rate hikes have already had the effect of raising mortgage rates roughly 2 percentage points since the year began and have slowed home sales.
Other central banks around the world are also acting swiftly to try to quell surging inflation, even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the U.S. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter-point in July, its first increase in 11 years. It could announce a larger hike in September if record-high levels of inflation persist.
The global efforts to tighten credit are escalating the risk of a severe downturn in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Last week, the World Bank warned of the threat of “stagflation” — slow growth accompanied by high inflation — around the world.
By the end of 2022, the Fed will have raised its key rate as high as a range of 3.25% to 3.5%, some economists estimate, higher than what was forecast just a few weeks ago. At that level, the rate would likely be well above “neutral,” meaning at a level that would be intended to slow growth. In March, the Fed had forecast that it would raise rates only to a range of 1.75% to 2% by year's end.
After the Fed's last meeting in May, when it raised its benchmark rate by a half-point, Chair Jerome Powell said that similar increases were “on the table” for the central bank's June and July meetings, should the economy “evolve in line with expectations.”
But on Friday, the government reported that year-over-year inflation accelerated unexpectedly in May to 8.6%, the highest such level in four decades. Inflation has spread to nearly every corner of the economy, with costs rising for rents, gas, clothing, medical care, airline fares and clothing.
Also on Friday, a consumer sentiment survey by the University of Michigan found that Americans’ expectations for future inflation are rising. That is a worrisome sign for the Fed, because expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect higher inflation in the future, they often change their behavior in ways that increase prices. For example, they may accelerate large purchases before they become more expensive. Doing so can intensify demand and further fuel inflation.
The accelerated series of rate hikes now expected from the Fed will increase the likelihood of a recession in the next year or so.
“I think we’re sort of past the point where a ‘soft landing’ is plausible,” said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at the investment bank Jeffries, referring to the Fed's effort to raise rates enough to slow growth but not so much as to cause a recession. “I think they’re going to have to cause a contraction.”
A key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the Fed to slow inflation to its 2% target, it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending, wage gains and economic growth. Ultimately, the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise — something the Fed hasn't yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue Wednesday.
“When you’re on the highway going 90 miles an hour and you miss your exit, slowing down is not going to help you,"" Markowska said. ""You have to do a U-turn and go back.”
Other central banks are also looking at jumbo rate hikes to combat inflation. In addition to the ECB, the Bank of England has raised rates four times since December to a 13-year high, despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter. The BOE will hold an interest rate meeting on Thursday.
The 19 European Union countries that use the euro currency endured record inflation of 8.1% last month. The United Kingdom notched a 40-year high of 9% in April. Though debt service costs remain contained for now, rising borrowing costs for indebted governments threatened the eurozone with a breakup in the early part of the last decade.",https://www.wltx.com/article/news/nation-world/fed-rate-hike/507-712efdf8-4e15-42f6-a21e-9c5b33328ca7

“There was 20 million dollars in the Rebuild Illinois, that is a reappropriation,” Colleen Callahan said. “There was also some 35 million that was just waiting, and now when you add the 35 and 20 we really have 50 some million that can be utilized.”
That is Director Colleen Callahan of the state Department of Natural Resources, who said farmers can apply for those funds beginning today at Farm Service Agency Offices. Jamie Diebal of the State FSA says, the funds help bolster the CRP.
“CREP is just an extra division that we have a partnership with IDNR to allow extra incentives for producers,” Diebal said.
Stu: Incentives, such as?
They get a 25% rental rate incentive, there is also no cap to the rental rate, that our normal CREP has, and they also get incentives though the state, extra cost share payments and that easement option,” Diebal said.
Michael Woods of the Illinois Department of Agriculture says CREP will filter crop nutrients out of water making its way to the Gulf of Mexico.
“So the CREP program will protect those marginal lands, and provide another tool to our producers across the state,” Woods said. “So we start thinking about nutrient loss reduction strategy we are trying to make change on basically 27 million acres for 72 thousand producers across the state of Illinois. Programs like CREP are an amazing tool that will help provide resources to mitigate some of the soil loss, as well as the nutrient loss on those marginal lands.”
Grant Hammer who heads the Association of Soil and Water Conservation districts says his local members will help guide farmers through the process.
“So Soil and Water Conservation districts or SWCDS have a truly unique relationship with local producers county-based organizations, they tend to know their farmers and have established relationships and so forth, and what the SWCDS to is help market the program locally, help walk the producer through the enrollment process, and really serve as a guide though the process,” Hammer said.
The CREP program will target nutrient reduction in the Illinois and Kaskaskia Watersheds. That’s our report from the farm, I’m Stu Ellis with WCIA-3, your local news leader.",https://www.wcia.com/news/from-the-farm-crep-renewal/
21,"The Fed is about to jack up interest rates, Wall Street says",2022-06-15T11:58:00Z,The Federal Reserve may be set to announce the biggest rate hike since the 1990s. Here's how that would impact your wallet.,"Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve turned to its most potent weapon — raising interest rates — to combat soaring inflation. But with consumer prices having only accelerated since then, Wall Street analysts say consumers and investors should gird for an even bigger hike this week as central bankers try to tame the nation's fiercest bout with inflation in 40 years.
The Fed, which will announce its decision on Wednesday at 2 p.m. Eastern time, could lift rates by 0.75%, according to analysts at TD Macro. That would come after announcements of a 0.25% hike in March and a 0.5% move in May — with the latter marking the sharpest increase since 2000.
If the Fed decides on a three-quarter point boost, it would be the first rate hike of that size since 1994. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a report on Tuesday that they expect 0.75% hikes at the central bank's meetings both this week and in July, underscoring what they called a ""need for speed"" in clamping down on inflation.
Indeed, speed is of the essence in confronting inflation, economists say. The Consumer Price Index, a broad basket of goods and services used to track inflation, surged 8.6% in May, from an 8.3% annual rate in April. Gasoline prices have continued to hit new highs almost daily amid depleted domestic production and Russia's war in Ukraine, while food and housing costs are also surging.
With more inflation data under its belt, the Fed is likely to ratchet its rate hikes higher, some analysts say.
""We believe this shows the Fed is more determined to do what it takes to end the inflation overshoot as rapidly as possible even if that raises the chance of a hard landing in 2023,"" TD Macro said in the report.
To be sure, some Wall Street analysts continue to expect a more modest interest-rate hike increase on Wednesday, but others are tweaking their economic forecasts to factor in sharper monetary tightening. By year-end, the federal funds rate — the rate that determines borrowing between banks — could be almost twice as high as its pre-pandemic level of about 2%, according to forecasts.
""It was just a few weeks ago that investors were forecasting the funds rate to be ~2.58% at the end of this year, but that number is now more than 100 [basis points] higher at 3.7%,"" analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge told clients in a research note. ""And the 'terminal' funds rate (the level at which the Fed will stop hiking this cycle) is now seen north of 4%.""
Here's what the Fed jacking up interest rates could mean for your wallet.
What will the rate hike cost you?
Every 0.25% increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate translates to an extra $25 a year in interest on $10,000 in debt. So a 0.75% increase would mean an extra $75 of interest for every $10,000 in debt.
Economists expect the Fed will continue to raise rates throughout the year as it battles inflation. Some analysts now forecast the central bank will announce another 0.75% increase in July, followed by two 0.5% hikes in September and November.
By early 2023, the federal funds rate could be 3.75% to 4%, according to TD Macro. That implies a rate increase of at least 2.75% higher than the current federal funds rate of 1%. For consumers, that means they could pay an additional $275 in interest for every $10,000 in debt.
How could it impact the stock market?
The stock market has slumped this year amid various headwinds, including the impact of high inflation and the Fed's monetary tightening. But a bigger-than-expected interest rate increase on Wednesday ""could be welcomed by stocks,"" Crisafulli said.
""It would represent a powerful signal by [Fed Chair Jerome Powell], help the Fed recapture control of the policy narrative and clamp down on the massive change in tightening forecasts,"" he noted.
Credit cards, home equity lines of credit
Credit card debt will become more expensive, with higher APRs hitting borrowers within one or two billing cycles after the Fed's announcement, according to LendingTree credit expert Matt Schulz. For instance, after the Fed's March hike, interest rates for credit cards increased for three-quarters of the 200 cards that Schulz reviews every month.
Consumers with balances may want to consider a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan, Schulz said. Consumers can also ask their credit card companies for a lower rate, which research has shown is frequently successful.
Credit with adjustable rates may also see an impact, including home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are based on the prime rate.
What's the impact on mortgage rates?
Mortgage rates have already surged in response to the Fed's rate increases this year. The average 30-year mortgage stood at 5.23% on June 9, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from 2.96% a year earlier.
That is adding thousands to the annual cost of buying a property. For instance, a purchaser buying a $250,000 home with a 30-year fixed loan would pay about $3,600 more per year compared with what they would have paid a year earlier.
But the Fed's next rate hike might already be baked into current mortgage rates, said Jacob Channel, senior economic analyst for LendingTree, in an email.
""The Fed's rate hike may not mean that mortgage rates are going to significantly increase,"" he noted.
The housing market reflects one part of the economy where the Fed's rate increases are slowing demand. Channel added: ""These high rates have significantly dampened borrower desire to refinance current loans, and they're also showing signs of reducing demand for purchase mortgages as well.""
Savings accounts, CDs
When it comes to higher interest rates, the bright side for consumers is better yields from savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
""Online deposit rate gains have accelerated after the last two Fed rate hikes. Further acceleration is expected"" with additional hikes, said Ken Tumin of DepositAccounts.com in an email.
In May, the typical online savings account yield increased from 0.54% to 0.73%, while average yields on one-year online CDs rose from 1.70% to 2.53%, he noted.
That's better than savers used to earn, but it's still far below the rate of inflation. That means that savers are essentially eroding the value of their money by socking it into a savings account while inflation is running above 8%.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fed-interest-rate-hike-2022-75-basis-point-rate-hike-wednesday/
22,Stock market news lives updates: Stock futures rise as traders brace for Fed decision,2022-06-15T11:49:47Z,U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday morning as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision.,"U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday morning as investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision.
Contracts on the S&P 500 gained about 0.8% in pre-market trading, and the index looked to end a five-day losing streak. Nasdaq futures increased by more than 1%, and Dow futures gained about 0.6%. Treasury yields declined, and the benchmark 10-year yield pulled back from a more than decade-high to below 3.4%. Bitcoin prices (BTC-USD) took another leg lower to sink to a fresh Dec. 2020 low of just over $20,000.
Stocks slid and bond yields spiked this week as traders raced to price in the impact of a supersized interest rate hike from the Fed. The central bank is now widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the first time since 1994.
The likelihood of such a hike had been seen remote as recently as mid-last week, especially since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said clearly in May that policymakers were not actively considering an increase greater than 50 basis points. However, in the weeks since, the economic data have suggested the Fed's more measured moves have so far done little to address inflation, which set a fresh 40-year high in May. And other recent data showed consumers' inflation near-term expectations have crept to near or all-time highs.
""Given the gravity of the situation with inflation as it is now, even though it's kind of a surprise relative to what we've heard from the Fed in terms of what they said they were going to do, it looks like it's the right move,"" Tom Simons, Jefferies money market economist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. ""The markets are going to feel more confident about the Fed's credibility in terms of their ability to limit inflation. And overall, it's going to lead to a better positive outcome for the economy in the long run.""

Others, however, have been less supportive of a 75 basis point hike and cast doubt about whether it would ultimately be a net positive for the economy. The risk of the Fed over-tightening, or raising interest rates more swiftly than markets and the economy can adjust to, could ultimately do more damage than good, some pundits argued.
Story continues
""Our objection to this more aggressive action is that it is unnecessary, because the forces which have driven the recent inflation numbers are already fading,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Wednesday.""Slower wage gains, along with the rollover in the housing market, will depress rent growth, while airline fares are likely to fall over the summer in the wake of falling jet fuel prices, and vehicle prices will drop as inventories rise.""
""The inflation fix will not be more effective if the Fed hikes by 75bp [basis points] today or next month, rather than 25bp, and the damage done to private sector wealth could inadvertently trigger a downturn which otherwise would be averted,"" Shepherdson added. ""Less is not always more, but sometimes it is enough.""
The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision is set for 2 p.m. ET, with a press conference from Powell beginning at 2:30 p.m.
On the move
Gainers
Nio ( NIO ) shares were on track to rise for a back-to-back session on Wednesday ahead of a product launch event set for 8 p.m. ET. The company also suggested a new electric-vehicle model was coming, teasing a new product launch with a countdown clock on its website.
Boeing ( BA ) shares added to Tuesday's gains after the company said it delivered a total of 35 aircraft in May, more than doubling last year's tally of 17. The majority of these were for its lucrative 737 Max jet. Separately, The Seattle Times, citing a Federal Aviation Administration official, reported Boeing may be able to resume 787 Dreamliner deliveries in the coming weeks.
Baidu (BIDU) shares rose after Reuters reported the Chinese internet giant has been in talks to sell its majority stake in streaming business iQiyi. The deal could reportedly value the firm around $7 billion.
Decliners
Coinbase ( COIN ) headed for a seventh consecutive day of losses amid the ongoing price declines for the major cryptocurrencies. If maintained, this would mark Coinbase's longest losing streak since January.
Chevron (CVX), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), and other energy stocks dipped to track a dip in oil prices Wednesday morning. These moves came after the International Energy Agency said Wednesday in its new monthly report that global oil supplies will struggle to keep pace with demand next year, as sanctions against Russia take full effect at the same that China recovers from its recent COVID outbreak.

23,US Fed Meet: Will Rate Hike Spook Indian Markets? Know What Analysts Say,2022-06-15T11:46:47Z,"Experts and analysts said the Federal Reserve is expected to hike the interest rate by 75 basis points (bps) and it has already been factored in by the Indian Markets but its commentary on growth, inflation and future rate hikes will be a key watch out for. Here's what they say about the possible US Fed rate hike and its impact on India","Even as the American economy, like others in the world, is facing high inflation and the pace is hitting 40-year high, the US central bank will today conclude its monetary policy meet and announce its decision on the interest rate hike. Analysts expect the US Federal Reserve to hike the policy rate by 75 basis points (bps).
They said a rate hike of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the Indian stock markets but the US Fed’s commentary on growth, inflation and future rate hikes will be the key watch out for. Here’s what they say about the possible US Fed rate hike and its impact on India:
What is the Inflation Scenario In the US?
According to the latest data, consumer price inflation in the US increased 8.6 per cent year-on-year in May, which is the largest increase since December 1981 and followed an 8.3 per cent advance in April. The prices in the US accelerated on the back of high fuel prices and costlier food.
Natural gas prices in May jumped 8 per cent, the pace is the highest since October 2005, while electricity rate also rose 1.3 per cent. Food prices in May rose 1.2 per cent as part of the impact of supply chain disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Prices of dairy and related products also posted the largest gain since July 2007.
US Treasuries have jumped since the start of April and is above the 3 per cent mark.
FOMC Meet: What Is Being Expected
Given the latest inflation print of 8.6 per cent as against the US Federal Reserve’s target to control it under two per cent, most economists and analysts expect the American central bank to go for a 75-basis-point hike in the Fed fund rate. However, they said more than the rate hike, it’s the commentary that is important.
Ravindra Rao, head (commodity research) at Kotak Securities, said, “The base case for the Fed was to raise the interest rate by 0.5 per cent at its June meeting. However, after the latest US inflation data, market players are seeing an increased possibility of a 0.75 per cent hike today.”
He added that apart from the Fed decision, market players will also focus on economic projection as it will give more clarity about how the interest rate is expected to rise as well as what will be its impact on economic growth.
V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said, “More than the quantum of the rate hike (50 or 75 bps), it would be the message from the Fed in the policy announcement that would determine the market direction. The market is prepared for a 75-bp rate hike and, therefore, that decision, if it comes, is unlikely to rattle markets.”
Stating that inflation in the US is soaring and the market expects aggressive cuts, Arun Malhotra, founding partner & portfolio manager at CapGrow Capital Advisors, said the US Fed is expected to go for a 75-bp hike and another 50 bps in the next meeting.
What Will Be The Impact On India?
High inflation and the interest rate hikes in the US have been adversely affecting the Indian markets for quite some time. Foreign portfolio investors are pulling out their money from the Indian market. Experts said the possible rate hike by the US Fed of up to 75 basis points has already been factored in by the markets.
Kotak Securities’ Rao said, “Fed’s aggressive stance is largely factored in. So, the possibility of a negative surprise is low. If Fed’s decision comes largely in line with expectations, there is a possibility we may see some correction in the US dollar which may help commodities recover.”
The Sensex has decline about 1800 points in the past three days amid looming fears of stagflation and volatility ahead of the US Fed meeting decision. The aggressive rate hike of 50-75 bps is mostly factored by the market but updated economic and interest rate forecasts to be detailed by the central bank’s will closely control the future trend.
CapGrow’s Malhotra said, “The markets have factored in these hikes. There will not be much of an impact. Fed is trying for a smooth landing so as not to hurt growth. Wage inflation is still quite high, and the inflation numbers are not going down anytime soon. We may see some moderation by Q4CY22.”
Foreign investors have pulled out about Rs 14,000 crore so far this month. With this, the net outflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from equities reached Rs 1.81 lakh crore so far in 2022, data with depositories showed. The outflows are adversely affecting the Indian currency also, which has touched its all-time lows multiple times in the past few months.

24,The Fed's risky experiment to control inflation,2022-06-15T11:35:44Z,The Federal Reserve knows it needs to demonstrate that it can get inflation under control — and fast.,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter.

New York (CNN Business) The Federal Reserve knows it needs to demonstrate that it can get inflation under control — and fast.
What's happening: Pressure on the Fed has increased after the most recent batch of government data showed that annual inflation jumped to 8.6% in May , which was higher than economists had expected.
Investors now believe the Fed will raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday. That hasn't happened since 1994.
""Definitely, we're going to see 75 basis points after this meeting,"" Bill Dudley, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told CNN.
But interest rates aren't the only tool at the Fed's disposal. It's also beginning the process of shrinking its massive balance sheet after buying up trillions of dollars in financial assets during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""Should the economy remain overheated and inflation remain stubborn, that is part of the policy matrix,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM US, told CNN Business.
He thinks that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should make clear that, if necessary, the Fed could offload bonds at a quicker pace and start selling mortgage-backed securities, which could help ease pressure in the housing market.
So-called ""shelter"" costs are rising at the fastest rate in decades . That's concerning, since as a source of inflation, it tends to stick around.
""Filling a tank of gas, people can look at that and say, 'Maybe next week will be cheaper,'"" said Ronald Temple, co-head of multi-asset and head of US equity at Lazard Asset Management. ""Rent is a locked in expense for a year or two.""
But ramping up balance sheet reduction — a process known as ""quantitative tightening,"" or QT — also carries risks. The Fed has never undertaken a drawdown of this scale.
After gobbling up government bonds and mortgage securities during the Great Recession, the Fed started paring its balance sheet — which then contained just $4.5 trillion in assets — in late 2017. It halted the process in 2019 as markets panicked.
This time may be different.
""Last time the Fed tried to do this, there was no inflation,"" Temple said.
Still, he thinks the effects of quantitative tightening are likely to reverberate through markets. Stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies — all rallied dramatically when the Fed was in buying mode. What happens as it changes course?
""I think investors are underestimating the impact of QT,"" Temple said. ""Central banks manipulated every market.""
Layoffs rattle vulnerable industries
So far, even as investors have fretted about what's next for America's economy, the job market has remained strong.
US employers added 390,000 jobs in May . That pace of hiring was robust, albeit slower than in April.
But industries vulnerable to rising interest rates and market churn are starting to cut roles. That could portend rockier times ahead.
Crypto exchange Coinbase announced Tuesday that it's laying off 18% of its employees as the digital currency market crumbles.
CEO Brian Armstrong said in an open letter that the ""difficult decision"" to lay off about 1,000 employees was made to ensure ""we stay healthy during this economic downturn."" The exchange has more than 4,900 employees.
""A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,"" he warned.
Step back: Coinbase's market value has imploded in recent months. One year ago, the company was worth almost $50 billion. Now it's valued at less than $12 billion.
Crypto firms aren't the only ones facing pressure to control costs. Real estate broker Redfin said Tuesday that it will lay off about 8% of its employees as it grapples with the rapid run-up in mortgage rates.
""Mortgage rates increased faster than at any point in history,"" CEO Glenn Kelman told employees. ""We could be facing years, not months, of fewer home sales.""
Redfin's stock has plunged almost 80% year-to-date.
Where did the 'bear' in bear market come from?
This week, US stocks fell into a bear market, dropping more than 20% from their most recent peak in early January.
But why is a forest-dwelling mammal associated with scared investors dumping shares on Wall Street?
My colleague Allison Morrow did some digging. She found out that the term derives from ""bearskin,"" which was used in the 18th century as a metaphor for the kind of speculative trading known today as short-selling, or betting that a stock will go down.
It comes from a proverb warning not to ""sell a bear's skin before one has caught the bear,"" according to Merriam-Webster.
Bearskin got shortened to bear, and here we are.
The term caught on after the South Sea Bubble of 1720, and again after the 1929 crash that led to the Great Depression.
Another idea is that a bear attacks by swiping its paws downward on its prey. Downward swipe = stocks go down. Seems as fair a hypothesis as any.

25,Markets brace for sharpest rise in US interest rates in almost 30 years,2022-06-15T11:27:45Z,Federal Reserve expected to increase cost of borrowing by 0.75 percentage points to curb rising inflation,"The world’s financial markets are bracing themselves for the sharpest rise in US interest rates in almost 30 years, as America’s central bank takes action to halt rising inflation.
After days of frenzied investor speculation and signs of growing central bank anxiety, the Federal Reserve is expected to increase the official cost of borrowing by 0.75 percentage points for the first time since 1994.
The Fed meeting, with an interest rate announcement due at 7pm UK time on Wednesday, will be preceded by an emergency meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) to discuss crashing bond prices in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
The Bank of England is expected to raise UK interest on Thursday, after the rise in UK inflation to a 40-year high. Despite some speculation of a 0.5 point increase, the City expects a 0.25 point rise to 1.25%.
The Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, had previously ruled out a 0.75 point increase but the central bank appears to have had a change of heart after higher than expected US inflation was announced last week.
News that the US measure of the cost of living had hit 8.6% – the highest in four decades – prompted a sharp sell off in both bonds and share prices, as investors took fright at the possibility of action to combat high inflation leading to recession.
The S&P 500 index – a broad measure of the health of the US stock market – has fallen 20% since its peak in January, while the technology-rich Nasdaq index has dropped by a third.
“Investors have now fully aligned with the view that the Fed will hike by 0.75 points today, following the unexpected acceleration in inflation and inflation expectations in May and media reports suggesting the option was being discussed by policymakers,” said analysts at ING bank.
“While a 75 basis-point move is not certain, we doubt such potential ‘leaks’ to the media are a coincidence, and they do appear to us as a (successful) attempt to adjust expectations during the blackout period and prepare markets for the larger increase.”
The prospect of a bigger than expected jump in US interest rates coupled with weak growth figures in the UK pushed the pound to its lowest level in two years against the US dollar.

Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said of the ECB move: “Given there was a scheduled meeting last week, it smacks of panic and a lack of control, but the market is happy to see it happen. European bank shares rose and the euro also rallied, while Italian yields came back down.”
Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “News that the ECB governing council is holding an emergency meeting today shows that policymakers are taking the threat of rising peripheral yields more seriously than they were last Thursday at their regular policy meeting.”
The Fed statement and remarks by Powell at a press conference immediately afterwards will be scrutinised to see whether further sharp increases in US rates are likely. Some analysts think the central bank will raise them by 0.75 points again next month.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/15/markets-brace-rise-us-interest-rates-federal-reserve-borrowing-inflation

28,Analysis: Weak pound and forceful Fed pressure Bank of England to act big,2022-06-15T10:56:17Z,"With Britain's currency sinking and the U.S. Federal Reserve poised to raise borrowing costs aggressively, Bank of England policymakers may suddenly feel pressured to announce an outsized interest rate hike of their own this week.","LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - With Britain's currency sinking and the U.S. Federal Reserve poised to raise borrowing costs aggressively, Bank of England policymakers may suddenly feel pressured to announce an outsized interest rate hike of their own this week.
Even though Britain's economy shrank unexpectedly in April and there were some signs of inflationary forces in the labour market ebbing, the pound's slide and the increasingly hawkish stance of other central banks put the BoE in a tough spot.
All but one of the 56 economists polled by Reuters last week expected the BoE to raise Bank Rate on Thursday to 1.25% from 1.0%, but many warn a rise to 1.5% could be a close call.

Financial markets point to a roughly 43% chance of a 50 bps hike.
Recent events arguably show why.
Sterling on Tuesday slid below $1.21, its lowest since May 2020 – a headache for members of the Monetary Policy Committee who know that a weak currency will exacerbate inflation in the months ahead, with Britain reliant on energy imports.
The pound has fallen 4.5% against the dollar since late May, when finance minister Rishi Sunak announced further help for households facing a hefty cost-of-living hit - a package that economists had thought might shore up confidence in Britain's economic outlook, and with it the currency.
The boost to sterling did not last long, however, as U.S. inflation accelerated more than expected, intensifying bets on Fed rate hikes.
Last week, the European Central Bank flagged rate hikes at its next two meetings, including a possible half percentage-point rise in September.
The BoE's trade-weighted sterling index , which measures the pound against a basket of currencies, fell on Monday to its lowest since January last year.
Trade-weighted sterling slides to lowest since January 2021
HAWKISH CENTRAL BANKS
Brexit tensions - namely the escalating row over Northern Ireland's status that threatens to upend British trade ties with the European Union - have also hurt the pound.
Worse yet could follow if, as financial markets increasingly expect, the Fed on Wednesday raises its main interest rate by 75 basis points, which would be its biggest increase since 1994, further boosting the dollar at sterling's expense. read more
The central banks of India and Australia have already raised rates by 50 basis points, the latter coming as a hawkish surprise to investors. read more
""If the Bank starts to lag behind, then that would probably increase the downward pressure on the pound,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
""That would actually influence the Bank of England's projections for its inflation target in three to four years time, which is what it's aiming for,"" he added.
Dales was the only economist in the Reuters poll to forecast a 50 basis-point increase in Bank Rate.
Previous BoE research has suggested a 10% fall in sterling would raise the level of the consumer price index by about 2.7 percentage points, over a period of three to four years.
REASONS NOT TO HIKE
But some economists say the BoE should resist pressure to join other central banks in a rush to raise rates, given Britain looks more prone to recession than many of its peers.
The OECD sees zero British growth next year - the weakest of any G20 economy apart from Russia - and the British Chamber of Commerce expects the economy to shrink 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022 before growing just 0.6% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024.
""What you wouldn't want to see is the MPC losing its independence of thought and joining a big cohort of central banks in a stampede to tighten aggressively,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
A 50 basis-point hike - which would be the first in Britain since February 1995 - would represent a presentational challenge for the BoE. Its chief economist Huw Pill has stressed the virtues of a ""steady-handed"", gradual approach to raising rates.
The BoE was the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates in December last year and another hike on Thursday would be the fifth time in five policy meetings that it had increased borrowing costs, its steepest pace in 25 years.
Also there remains a question over whether five or more of the nine MPC members would plump for such a big rate hike.
In May, only three external members - Jonathan Haskel, Michael Saunders and Catherine Mann - voted for a 50 basis-points hike.
Even if they were joined on Thursday by Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden, who has previously sat on the hawkish end of the MPC, they would still need at least one more of the other members - none of whom have publicly expressed an appetite for moving in bigger steps.
Economists from Bank of America on Tuesday said their base case was for a 6-3 split in favour of a 25 basis-point hike.
""We see risks skewed to a 5-4 vote and look for more hawkish guidance,"" they added.
All BoE watchers are agreed, however, that the swirl of downbeat data, febrile financial markets and political pressure make predicting policy especially tricky.
""It's quite easy for me to come out and say, 'go on, do this' but they have to make a decision that really makes a difference,"" Dales from Capital Economics said. ""They have my sympathy.""

29,Federal Reserve expected to order rare 3/4-point interest rate hike to control inflation,2022-06-15T10:55:00Z,"Amid persistent concerns about rising costs in the U.S., the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a policy meeting and is expected to do something it hasn't done in almost 30 years to get control of inflation.","1/4

June 15 (UPI) -- Amid persistent concerns about rising costs in the United States, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will conclude a policy meeting and is expected to do something it hasn't done in almost 30 years to get control of inflation. Many analysts expect the Fed to hike interest rates by three-quarters of a point -- a sizable increase it hasn't made in decades. The last time the central bank increased rates by that much was 1994 -- just before the U.S. economy boomed for the remainder of the 1990s. Advertisement
When the Federal Reserve raises rates, it usually does so in quarter-point increments. But with consumer inflation rising at an annual rate of about 8.6%, which is far above the Fed's target range, analysts feel that the central bank has to be aggressive. The Fed increased rates by a half-point at its last policy meeting in early May, which was its largest increase since 2000.

Too much consumer spending combined with other certain market conditions can cause inflation to rise. By increasing interest rates, the Fed is attempting to get Americans to borrow less, lower demand and freeze prices.
The Federal Reserve will announce its decision at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs this week adjusted its forecast and expects a three-quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday and at the Fed's next policy meeting in July, followed by a half-point increase in September. From there, the Fed will make quarter-point hikes in November and December, the investment bank projected.
That would raise the federal funds rate to between 3.25% and 3.5% by the end of 2022. Presently, interest rates are between 3/4% and 1%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed some optimism in March about a ""soft landing"" for the recovering economy, which has been disrupted by COVID-19 and the Russian war in Ukraine. Energy prices, notably gasoline, have been the primary driver of inflation over the past several months.

""I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common,"" Powell said at the time.
In 1994, then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan achieved a soft landing when interest rates reached 6% over seven different rate hikes -- including two half-point increases and a three-quarter-point increase to stem inflation after a recession in the early part of the 1990s.
Some economists note, however, that Greenspan proactively raised rates to get ahead of inflation while Powell has mostly been reactionary. Greenspan was also aided by a robust workforce as baby boomers entered the pinnacle of their careers and immigration numbers were strong. Today, Powell faces a different workforce that's been whittled down by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""In the past, when you've pushed up the unemployment rate, you've almost never been able to avoid a full-fledged recession,"" former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley told CNN. ""The problem the Fed faces is they're just late.""

Presently, the national unemployment rate is historically low at about 3.6%, the Labor Department said in its jobs report for May. After COVID-19 arrived in early 2020, the unemployment rate soared to more than 15%. Ten years ago, the unemployment rate was about 8%.
The full economic and inflationary outcome that will result from Wednesday's anticipated rate increase, and the rate hikes for the rest of 2022, won't be known for months.
The Labor Department said last week that consumer prices are up about 8.6% over the past 12 months. On Tuesday, it said producer prices -- the cost of goods at the wholesale level, before they reach consumers -- are up 10.8% since May of 2021.
The Fed's decision on Wednesday is expected to have a significant impact on Wall Street. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by about 150 points, while the S&P 500 shed about 15 points. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, was up by about 20 points.

June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures inched higher on Wednesday as investors waited to see how high the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to quell inflation at its policy meeting.
Investors have dramatically raised their bets of a 75 basis points (bps) rate hike, rather than 50 bps, following hotter-than-expected consumer prices data last week, fueling a selloff across global markets. read more

Traders are currently pricing in a more than 94% chance of a 75 basis point hike, up from 8.2% a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Such a big hike would lift the Fed's short-term target policy rate to a range of 1.5% and 1.75%.
The central bank will release its statement at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), with a press briefing by Fed Chair Jerome Powell expected at 2:30 p.m. ET.
""75bps is already built into prices now, and if the guidance is more modest in scope, the buy-the-dippers will be out in force for the rest of the week,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Escalating concerns around inflation, aggressive tightening by central banks, the Ukraine war and China's COVID-19 restrictions have walloped global equities this year.
The benchmark S&P 500 index on Monday marked a more than 20% decline from its most recent record high, confirming a bear market began on Jan. 3, according to a commonly used definition.

Here's 3 ways the world could be hit,2022-06-15T10:33:58Z,Global markets have taken a hammering to start the week as expectations grow that the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to hike interest rates more aggressively than planned.,"A screen displays the Fed rate announcement as a trader works inside a post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., May 4, 2022.

Global markets took a hammering to start the week as expectations grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to hike interest rates more aggressively than planned. May's U.S. consumer price index reading came in at 8.6% year-on-year, the highest print since 1981, and prompted the market to price in a 75 basis point hike from the Fed on Wednesday. Markets broadly expect between nine and 10 rate hikes from now to early 2023, with at least 50 basis point increments at each of the next three Federal Open Market Committee meetings and a terminal rate of 4%. Global recession A more aggressive Fed is likely to have ripple effects throughout the global economy, and as such, Friday's inflation print triggered a multi-day sell-off of stocks worldwide. ""Friday's U.S. inflation print had an impact on markets globally, and that seems appropriate given that the Fed, to a certain extent, is the world's central banker, and could certainly help cause a global recession,"" said Kristina Hooper, a global market strategist at Invesco. Hooper remained hopeful that the U.S. will still be able to avoid a recession and that the Fed will succeed in engineering a ""soft landing"" by being sufficiently hawkish but data-responsive. However, she acknowledged that the U.S. economy is clearly heading toward a significant slowdown, and the ""soft landing"" is becoming harder to achieve.
""Admittedly, slowing just enough to cool inflation but not cause a recession is an extremely delicate balancing act given that monetary policy is a blunt instrument, not a surgical tool. So of course recession risks have increased with last week's CPI print and consumer inflation expectations reading,"" she added. Famed economist Kenneth Rogoff pointed out in April that a U.S. recession, especially if triggered by an interest rate hiking cycle, would curtail global import demand and wreak havoc for financial markets. Central bank knock-on effect The European Central Bank last week confirmed its intention to hike its main interest rate by 25 basis points at its July meeting, with a further hike slated for September. However, the ECB called an emergency monetary policy meeting on Wednesday as bond yields surged for many governments across the euro zone. Stephane Monier, chief investment officer at Banque Lombard Odier, told CNBC on Wednesday that the decision to hold an unscheduled meeting prior to the Fed's announcement was significant. ""It probably means to a certain extent that they are afraid that the Fed will be doing serious rate hikes like the 75 basis points that we are expecting, and that will somehow have some impact on risky assets in the market, and it will further increase fragmentation in European sovereign bond markets,"" Monier said.
Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC on Tuesday that the currency implications of the anticipated hawkish shift from the Fed action could influence European policymakers. ""It clearly means that we could see a stronger dollar and therefore a weaker euro, which had already been a concern for several ECB officials. If we were ready to move towards parity, I think the weaker euro – even if this is not a target for the ECB – adds to the inflationary pressure, and therefore is a concern,"" Brzeski said. ""What this could mean is that at least the hawks at the ECB would push for more rate hikes than they have currently penciled in just to offset the inflationary impact from a weaker euro."" With tightening financial conditions and a global sell-off in risk assets underway, the traditional safe haven U.S. dollar has rallied significantly in recent trading sessions. Geoffrey Yu, senior EMEA market strategist at BNY Mellon, told CNBC on Tuesday that the imbalances driving dollar strength would not abate any time soon. ""The U.S. economy is far less sensitive to tightening in financial conditions from the exchange rate compared to trade-heavy economies — we're looking at the likes of Switzerland, Japan, the euro zone even, and there's a lot of emerging markets,"" Yu said. ""Global commodities are priced in dollars so from their own point of view, a stronger dollar in this environment is not good for them at all.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/fed-hikes-have-global-ramifications-heres-3-ways-the-world-could-be-hit.html
32,Markets Recoup Losses as Central Banks Meet,2022-06-15T09:55:01Z,"Investors appeared mostly unsurprised by the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a large rate increase, with the S&P 500 closing up 1.4 percent.","The markets remained fairly steady just after the decision was released because “there was no real surprise from the statement,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. “Markets were expecting the Fed to deliver a supersized rate hike, as all the recent data shows inflation expectations just are not easing any time.”
Earlier, the European Central Bank unexpectedly got in on the action, calling an unscheduled meeting of policymakers on Wednesday to discuss market conditions. The borrowing costs of eurozone countries have diverged sharply in recent weeks, leading to so-called fragmentation that Christine Lagarde, the E.C.B. president, said last week the bank would “not tolerate.” The bank said it was taking steps to fend off spiraling borrowing costs in some highly indebted European countries, including a move to “accelerate” the design of a new tool to combat fragmentation — though it did not provide more details about the tool.
Many European stock and bond markets rallied on the news of the E.C.B. meeting. The Stoxx 600 index rose about 1.4 percent.
Earlier in the day most Asian markets gained ground, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gaining 1.1 percent and the Shanghai composite in China up 0.5 percent, though the Nikkei in Japan closed 1.1 percent lower.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/business/markets-update.html
33,Markets find their feet as policymakers try to chart a path forward.,2022-06-15T09:54:55Z,The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank are aiming to curb inflation while not harming economic growth.,"Smoke billowed from the Freeport LNG plant in Quintana, Texas, after an explosion last week.
HOUSTON — Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Europe has desperately tried to find new sources of natural gas, including from the United States, to reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies.
Those efforts took a hit on Tuesday when an American gas company announced that it would take several months before it could repair a Texas export terminal that suffered a fire and explosion last Wednesday.
The suspension — which would affect roughly 14 percent of U.S. liquefied gas exports — was compounded by news that the Russian energy giant Gazprom would reduce its gas shipments to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline.
The two announcements sent European gas prices 16 percent higher on Tuesday, since Europe’s prices are set regionally, not globally like oil. Natural gas prices in the United States moved in the opposite direction, plummeting more than 16 percent.
When an explosion damaged part of the Freeport LNG terminal this month, officials said it would probably take three weeks to return the plant to normal functions. Gas prices, which had more than doubled since last year, dropped modestly.
But on Tuesday, the company changed its public outlook and announced that it hoped a partial restart in 90 days was feasible.
“At this time, completion of all necessary repairs and a return to full plant operations is not expected until late 2022,” the company said in a statement.
The Freeport facility is one of seven active export terminals that send supercooled gas around the world in supertankers.
The temporary closing, by reducing how much gas can be exported, will add natural gas supplies in the United States, bringing some relief to residential electricity customers as well as to refineries and other industrial plants that use gas for power and as a vital raw material. Gas that otherwise would have been exported will go into storage for use next winter since households in the United States will use less natural gas for heating during the summer months.
“It’s significant for both the U.S. market and the global market,” said Lindsay Schneider, a natural gas expert at RBN Energy, a Houston consultancy. “It could mean lower prices here as more gas is available to refill storage inventories, and for global markets it means a loss of supply and potentially stronger prices in Europe and in Asia.”
European countries are expanding their gas import facilities and pipelines, and they are lobbying Qatar, Australia and other exporters to hurry up and ship more gas. But Europe is in competition with Asian countries that look to gas to replace coal, a major pollutant of city air around China and India.
While international markets are tight, the Freeport accident and decline in prices could bolster critics who say gas exports are raising domestic prices, which could go lower permanently if less were exported.
That the closing of one export terminal “is having such a significant impact to prices” should be “alarming to federal policymakers,” said Paul Cicio, president of the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a lobbying group.
Oil and gas companies counter that there is plenty of gas in shale fields around Pennsylvania, Texas, New Mexico and Arkansas for export and domestic use if only regulators would approve the building of more pipelines.
While gasoline prices attract the most headlines, natural gas prices have surged over the last year and reached their highest level since 2008 last May, though they have eased in recent weeks.
The explosion at the Texas plant, on Quintana Island, did not cause any injuries. The fire ignited in some pipes between gas storage tanks and dock facilities used to transport the gas abroad. Experts say it appears that the explosion occurred because of a rupture of piping and the ignition of a gas vapor cloud.
Various state and federal agencies are investigating the explosion and fire, including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, better known by its acronym PHMSA. PHMSA has wide discretion in deciding whether a facility can come back on line, sometimes overriding an operator’s assessment.
Energy experts warned that problems at the Texas plant could take a long time to fix. A fire at the Kinder Morgan terminal in Georgia took part of its operations off line for about 18 months because of difficulties with finding parts.
The Freeport plant has had problems over the last year with delayed maintenance and intermittent outages that were thought to be connected with impurities in some of its gas supplies.
The United States has long exported gas to Canada and Mexico by pipeline, while liquefied natural gas exports have gradually grown over the last decade as domestic production has increased in shale fields around the country.
In recent years most of the liquefied gas exports have gone to Asia, but since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a shift in sales to Europe, which has relied on Russia for 40 percent of its gas supplies.
Four new American export terminals are under construction, while more than a dozen are waiting for the go-ahead from regulators and investors.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/15/business/economy-news-inflation-russia
34,"With blistering inflation and hawkish Fed, bond investors push for safety",2022-06-15T09:14:56Z,Volatile markets price in a super-sized hike from the Federal Reserve following evidence of scorching inflation,"Bond investors are embracing safety in their portfolios as volatile markets price in a super-sized hike from the Federal Reserve following evidence of scorching inflation.
Investors have drastically shifted their expectations about Wednesday’s decision to a rate hike of 75 basis points (bps) - not the 50 bps the market was expecting last week. The increased hawkishness has sent equity markets tumbling and bond yields surging, briefly inverting the yield curve and pushing stocks into a bear market.
Many investors support the Fed moving faster to dampen inflation, but they worry about the risk of recession.
“A surprise 75 basis-point hike would be a happy one,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona.
“The question is whether the economy can avoid recession and that would depend on what the Fed does. If the Fed raised by 50 and they say they’re willing to consider 75, then we know that they’re not going to get ahead of inflation. You need to front-end load the hikes.”
Tengler said her firm has been “defensive” in its bond portfolios, shortening duration and increasing the underlying quality of the assets.
Shorter-duration debt typically outperforms longer-dated debt in a rising rate environment.
Overall, futures on the fed funds rate, or the rate on unsecured overnight loans between banks, now reflect an 87% chance of a 75 bps rate hike on Wednesday, and a 75% probability of another such increase in July. The market has also factored in a fed funds rate of 4% by the summer next year.
Pershing Square Capital Management founder and chief executive officer Bill Ackman, in comments on Twitter on Tuesday, pushed for multiple 75 bps hikes, noting that market confidence in the Fed can only be restored if it delivers on what the market expects.
The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year. It also began to shrink its balance sheet this month, a process called quantitative tightening. The Fed’s balance sheet ballooned to nearly $9 trillion as part of its pandemic policy accommodation
The recent big spike in inflation was a major catalyst to the shift in expectations. Last Friday, data showed that in the 12 months through May, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.6%, the largest year-on-year increase in roughly 40 years.
BOND MARKET BETS
Ahead of the Fed decision, fixed income market players have kept short duration bets.
Some, however, have reduced those short-maturity trades, believing there are opportunities in the market given how credit spreads have widened and how rates have risen significantly since the beginning of the year.
“We are still short duration albeit to a lesser degree. We have been upgrading the quality of our portfolios under the premise that choppier markets and tighter monetary policies should cause credit spreads to widen,” said R.J. Gallo, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes in Pittsburgh.
His portfolios are also slightly overweight Treasuries and even though their duration is short, “we still like the high-quality nature of Treasuries for playing defense.”
But despite the Fed’s aggressive tightening, bond investors see opportunities in the fixed income space and for some, it may be time to start moving away from safety bets.
“At this point, being incredibly conservative from both a credit and duration standpoint is not the right place to be,” said Jason Brady, chief executive officer at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, overseeing $46 billion in assets.
“That’s where we were and we’re moving away from that.”
From a credit spread standpoint, Brady said his firm has become marginally less conservative.
Brady, for instance, cited U.S. high yield debt, with its spread to Treasuries widening to 487 basis points on Monday. On top of a 3.5% yield in U.S. five-year Treasuries, he noted that an investor would net a more than 7% yield, which is “not terrible.”
David Petrosinelli, managing director at broker-dealer InspereX in New York, has also been advising investors to be defensive in bond portfolios since the fourth quarter of last year, but still believes the Fed could slow the pace of tightening later this year.
He recommends a barbell strategy, which combines short and long maturity bonds. If rates rise, the investor will have the opportunity to reinvest the proceeds of the shorter-term securities at the higher rate.
Petrosinelli believes the Fed’s aggressive hikes this year will lead to a dramatic tail-off in consumption by end-2022.
“That’s going to slow the Fed down in the fourth quarter in terms of hiking rates. They will still need to raise rates, but the magnitude is going to decline quickly.”

35,"Some see few signs of a bottom in U.S. stocks, even after steep selloff",2022-06-15T09:13:18Z,Persistent worries over surging inflation and an aggressive Federal Reserve continue to pressure asset prices,"Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, June 14.Seth Wenig/The Associated Press
Despite a crushing selloff that pushed U.S. stocks into a bear market, investors see few signs suggesting equities have hit bottom, as persistent worries over surging inflation and an aggressive Federal Reserve continue to pressure asset prices.
The market’s losses have been steep. The 21.3% year-to-date decline in the S&P 500 as of Monday wiped out some $8.7 trillion in market value this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Meanwhile, the highest inflation rise in four decades has investors pricing in a once-unthinkable 75 basis-point rate increase at the Fed’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and worries are growing that the central bank won’t be able to tame consumer prices without tipping the economy into a recession.
Some strategists, however, are not convinced that all the factors are in place to mark the end of the declines.
“This is not necessarily what a bottom looks like,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. “It is perhaps what a bottoming process looks like.”
The S&P 500 on Tuesday ended down 22.1% from its Jan 3 record peak. The average decline for bear markets since 1946 has been 32.7%, according to investment research firm CFRA, which may suggest the current slide may have more room to run.
Similarly, the average bear market has lasted 389 calendar days from the peak to the bottom, more than twice as long as the current bear slide.
Hackett and other market participants are also watching a number of technical signs indicating that selling in stocks may have reached a crescendo.
One of the more famous indicators is the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which is known as “Wall Street’s fear gauge” and measures the expectation of stock-market volatility as expressed by options prices.
Since 1990, the volatility index has reached an average level of 37 at market bottoms, and spiked to 85 during the market’s coronavirus-fueled swoon of March 2020. By contrast, the VIX rose to 35.05 during Monday’s selloff: above its long-term median of about 18, but still below peak levels in other bear markets.
“It feels like investors are less panicked and more resigned to the fact that the next 6-12 months is going to be a slog (and elevated volatility is here to stay longer),” wrote Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, commenting on VIX contracts going out into the next year.
Still, volume on puts, which investors use to protect their portfolios from stock declines, hit 2.03 million contracts on Monday, the highest level since Fed 28, 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
Some also watch indicators on investor sentiment, with the hopes of potentially swooping into the markets when pessimism is high and selling is becoming exhausted.
Many such indicators show sentiment has soured. The latest weekly survey of the American Association of Individual Investors, for example, found bearish sentiment at 46.9% – topping its long term average of 30.5% but still below levels from earlier this year.
Those readings came before the higher-than-expected inflation reading on Friday that sent stocks tumbling and could sour investor sentiment further.
“Investor sentiment has been negative for a while now and that is a sign telling us we might be getting there as a bottom but we are not quite there yet,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Technical indicators aside, Kourkafas said it will be difficult for the market to fully bottom until investors are confident inflation has ebbed, allowing the Fed to ease back on its monetary tightening.
Others, however, are urging investors to focus on the long-term. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, notes that less than 5% of S&P 500 stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average.
That’s only happened nine times since 1990, and the S&P 500 was up in every single case a year later, with an average gain of 23%.
“Given the market is already pricing in a high probability of recession, that stocks are very oversold on several metrics, that valuations (while not cheap) have been reset, and sentiment is depressed, we would not reduce equities,” he wrote in a Tuesday report.

36,"World’s central banks got inflation calls wrong, economies pay as pandemic recovery fumbles",2022-06-15T09:06:11Z,"The Federal Reserve is anticipated to raise interest rates by 75 basis points Wednesday, just weeks after Chair Jerome Powell & his staff projected a half-percentage-point increase.","Hong Kong: Even after central banks recognized they got their inflation calls wrong last year, they’ve continued to flub their policy guidance, threatening greater damage to their credibility, roiling markets and undermining the pandemic recovery.
The Federal Reserve is now expected to hike interest rates by 75 basis points Wednesday, just weeks after Chair Jerome Powell and his team repeatedly advertised a half percentage point move. It’s the latest in a series of misfires, from deeming high inflation “transitory” last year to speeding up the end of its bond-purchase program to accelerating the runoff of its bond portfolio.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has lately also turned more hawkish than she previously indicated, and the Reserve Bank of Australia is among those raising rates faster than policy makers had signaled.
Investors are casting judgment as they fret that the race to make up for past forecasting errors raises the risk of recessions. Global stocks have entered a bear market, US Treasury yields on Monday posted their biggest two-day jump since the 1980s and credit markets are showing signs of increasing stress.
The ECB’s Governing Council will hold an ad-hoc meeting on Wednesday “to discuss current market conditions,” according to a spokesman. Meanwhile, the showdown between bond traders and the Bank of Japan is rapidly escalating as the central bank struggles to convince markets that its ultra-loose monetary policy is sustainable, with ten-year bond futures slumping by the most since 2013 on Wednesday.
The blunders by monetary mavens tarnish a reputation of ensuring price stability and preventing the kind of inflationary spiral that hammered middle-class incomes in the 1970s. The loss of credibility means even greater policy action may be needed to defuse price pressures.

Anchors aweigh
“Central banks are in a dilemma,” said Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member who’s now a Keio University professor. “To restore confidence, central banks need to raise policy rates” sufficiently to bring down inflation, and that “may lead to a further slowdown in the economic recovery,” she said.
Belief among households and companies that central banks will succeed in meeting their inflation goals over time helps to moderate price pressures. Households might hold off on some purchases, confident some prices will come down in time. And workers would be less likely to embed cost-of-living compensation demands in wage talks.
Policy makers until recently highlighted that long-term inflation expectations were contained — a testament to their credibility. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans explained in March that current-day inflation wasn’t like the 1980s because “overly accommodative monetary policy” in the 1960s and 1970s had contributed to a buildup of long-term inflation expectations.
Friday’s University of Michigan gauge of longer-term price expectations showed a major crack in that narrative, jumping to the highest since a 2008 oil-price spike.
The Fed, ECB and its peers can’t be blamed for failing to anticipate the price surges stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or, arguably, the duration of global supply-chain challenges.
Nevertheless, continuing to expand their balance sheets in 2021 and to keep rates near zero even as inflation soared and economies recovered from the depths of the Covid-19 crisis now looks to have helped sow the seeds of current turmoil, critics say.
“That, I believe, will deal a devastating blow to the credibility of central banks — when investors realize that the inflation we face is ‘man-made,’ and central banks have played an instrumental role,” said Stephen Jen, who runs Eurizon SLJ Capital, a hedge fund and advisory firm in London.
Powell took until November to “retire” the description of inflation as “transitory” and last month acknowledged that with “hindsight then, yes, it probably would’ve been better to have raised rates earlier.”
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a consistent Fed critic since early 2021, blasted US central bank forecasters’ March expectations for inflation as “delusional when issued.”
The Fed’s preferred price gauge rose an annual 6.3% in April. The median estimate of Fed officials in March was for 4.3% for 2022. Fresh forecasts are due Wednesday.
The US isn’t the only one facing a credibility challenge.
Lagarde and her colleagues are now on course to raise rates by a quarter point in July and 50 basis points in September. That’s after Lagarde said in December it would be unlikely there would be any tightening this year.
“All international institutions, all forecasters of repute have actually made the same mistake” of underestimating the crisis, Lagarde said last week.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe in May said it was “embarrassing” that his previous policy guidance that rates would remain at a record-low until 2024 had proved so wrong.
But in India, the central bank pushed back against suggestions they were behind the curve as recently as April, only to then go on to raise its key interest rate two months in a row. Inflation, meantime, remains well outside its tolerance zone.
For many, polls are showing evidence of public loss of confidence.
A Gallup survey released in May showed just 43% of those polled had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence Powell would do the right thing for the US economy. While not the lowest among recent Fed chiefs, it’s well under the 74% Alan Greenspan got in the early 2000s.
For the first time on record, more people were dissatisfied than satisfied with the performance of the Bank of England when it comes to controlling prices, a quarterly BOE survey showed.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has seen his popularity slump after he said consumers were becoming more tolerant of rising prices. A Kyodo News survey published Monday found 59% deemed him unfit for the job.
Stanley Druckenmiller, who runs Duquesne Family Office, this month warned that because central bank policy a year ago was totally inappropriate, it’s inevitable that investors will lose money.
“If you’re predicting a soft landing, it’s going against decades of history,” said Druckenmiller, 68, who managed money for billionaire George Soros for more than a decade. -Bloomberg

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin recovered on Wednesday after diving to an 18-month low, buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve's tough stance on inflation even in the midst of a market meltdown this week after crypto lender Celsius froze customer withdrawals.
The world's largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 7.8% to $20,079.72, its lowest since December 2020. It has lost about 33% against the U.S. dollar since Friday, dropping more than 50% since the beginning of the year. It has slumped about 70% from its record high of $69,000 in November.
Bitcoin was last down 1.31% at $21,669.37.
The digital currency sector has been pummelled this week after Celsius froze withdrawals and transfers between accounts, stoking fears of contagion in markets shaken by the demise of the terraUSD and luna tokens last month.
Cryptocurrencies were buoyed as the S&P 500 rallied after a policy announcement by the Fed to raise interest rates, snapping a five-session losing skid.
The Fed raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its biggest rate hike since 1994.
Crypto funds saw outflows of $102 million last week, according to digital asset manager CoinShares, citing investors' anticipation of tighter central bank policy.
The value of the global crypto market has tumbled 70% to under $900 billion from a peak of $2.97 trillion in November, CoinMarketCap data shows.

""Some parts of the broader crypto ecosystem are facing a rather harsh reckoning,"" said Mikkel Morch, executive director at digital asset hedge fund ARK36. ""As the reality of the bear market starts to settle in, the hidden leverages and structural weaknesses of projects that only worked when the prices went up are finally brought to light.""
Celsius has hired restructuring lawyers and is looking for possible financing options from investors, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Celsius is also exploring strategic alternatives including a financial restructuring, it said.
Story continues
Smaller cryptocurrencies, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, also fell. Ether, the second largest token, fell to as low $1,013, the lowest since January 2021, and was last down 1.22% at $1,172.76.
The chaos in the crypto market has spread to other companies, with a number of exchanges slashing workforces.
Major U.S. exchange Coinbase Global Inc said on Tuesday it would cut about 1,100 jobs, or 18% of its workforce. Gemini, another U.S. exchange, said this month it would cut 10% of its workforce.
Still, others continue to hire. Binance, the world's largest exchange, said it was hiring for 2,000 positions, and U.S. exchange Kraken said it had 500 roles to fill.
""Hunker down,"" tweeted Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.
Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, facing social media chatter it is facing liquidation issues, said it was committed to working things out.

U.S. Treasury yields pulled back slightly on Wednesday morning ahead of the Federal Reserve 's key monetary policy announcement.
The Federal Open Market Committee will conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and is expected to take aggressive action on interest rates in a bid to rein in inflation. The U.S. consumer price index rose by an annual 8.6% in May, its highest year-on-year increase since 1981.
Traders had initially been looking for a 50-basis-point interest rate hike, but in light of the red hot inflation print, the market is now pricing a more than 95% chance of a 75-basis-point increase, the biggest since 1994, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. (1 basis point equals 0.01%)
The Federal Open Market Committee in May raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.75% to 1%, from 0.25% to 0.5%.

Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike Decision Today: The US stocks on Tuesday extended losses from the previous session in which the S&P 500 confirmed entering the bear market territory as investors fear an aggressive rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
While Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 151.91 points or 0.50% lower at 30,364.83, the S&P 500 settled 0.38% southward a day after sinking 3.9% to enter the bear market territory. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 19.12 points to close at 10,828.35.
Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting started on Tuesday amid a blistering inflation surge in the United States. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will announce the decision on Wednesday at 1800 GMT (11:30 PM in India) with experts predicting an aggressive hike in the benchmark borrowing rate.
The Fed had raised interest rates by 25 basis points in March and 50 basis points in May to bolster the fight against inflation. But the last week's inflation data triggered talks of the Fed turning hawkish. Inflation in the US has hit a fresh 40-year high in May, according to the data released last week.
According to reports, the central bank is likely to go for a 75-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday. Just ahead of the Fed's meeting, Powell had signalled that a big hike in the interest rate is on the cards.

Rate rise expectations for tonight’s US Federal Reserve meeting have shifted from 0.5% to 0.75% after Friday’s inflation reading came in at a 40-year high of 8.6%, much higher than forecast.
According to CME’s FedWatch Tool, markets are betting on a 94% chance of a 0.75% move. The Fed’s increasingly aggressive stance on inflation has boosted the US dollar and left the pound trading at below $1.20 versus the greenback last night.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The reality is that central banks are so far behind the curve, that they can’t see the curve. That said, it doesn’t mean a move by 75 basis points today is a good idea.
“It’s not, coming as it does so late in the day, especially given the consistent guidance for a 50 basis points move over the past few weeks, and gives the impression of a Fed which is losing control of events and exhibiting a certain level of panic about the path of inflation.”
Hewson said it was important for Fed policymakers to take note of yesterday’s producer price index release, which showed that inflation is already slowing as core prices hit their lowest levels since November at 8.3%.
If the Fed does increase by 0.75% tonight, there will be additional pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates by 0.5% tomorrow.
Ahead of the Fed meeting, IG Index has forecast that the FTSE 100 index will open 0.7% higher at 7240. The S&P 500 fell another 0.4% last night, marking its fifth straight decline as investors worry that higher interest rates will spark a global recession.

LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Slumping stocks and surging bond yields are rapidly crimping global financial conditions, yet given their effect on dampening economic growth and eventually inflation, the moves might be welcomed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.
Financial conditions is the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding for households and businesses. Tighter conditions are widely seen as heralding a growth slowdown and vice-versa.
So the recent sell-off in global markets - driven by signs of faster-than-anticipated interest rate rises in the United States and Europe - is contributing to a sharp contraction in financial conditions. read more

The widely used Goldman Sachs U.S. financial conditions index (FCI) shows a 100 basis points (bps) tightening this month alone. The last time the U.S. FCI contracted as sharply was during the February-March 2020 COVID-linked sell-off, Goldman data shows.
US conditions
Goldman's rule of thumb is that a persistent 100 bps FCI tightening slows GDP by about one percentage point after a year, in turn slowing inflation by roughly 0.1 percentage point.
The contraction picked up speed amid a markets sell-off that took U.S. Treasury yields to the highest in over a decade, confirmed a bear market in U.S. shares and sent yield premia on top-grade U.S. corporate debt to the highest in years. (.MERER00).
Yields have soared too in Europe, where rate expectations have repriced higher and interbank lending rates saw their biggest daily rise in over 10 years on Tuesday. read more
But while the FCI tightening appears alarming, it may not be for central banks, which face inflation at multi-decade highs; in fact the latest sell-off was sparked by above-forecast U.S. inflation for May of 8.1%.
All the more so because, as BlueBay Asset Management CIO Mark Dowding points out, Goldman's FCI remains in line with its 30-year average of around 99.8. Another FCI compiled by the Chicago Fed shows U.S. conditions well below their 50-year average.
""Central banks are clearly managing their messaging with one eye on financial conditions and at this point in time they wouldn't want them to be much easier, that would more likely make them become more hawkish,"" Dowding said.
An inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve this week shows fears are growing of a recession triggered by aggressive rate hikes.
So if tighter conditions force growth to slow, bring down inflation expectations and thus enable fewer rate hikes down the line, markets may be doing central bankers' job for them.
""The looser conditions are today, the greater the risk of higher inflation tomorrow,"" said Fahad Kamal, CIO at Kleinwort Hambros.
""The fact they are tightening is a good thing. Conditions are still a long ways off being tight, they have gone from being crazy loose to just loose.""
Chicago Fed
HOLD IT
What is alarming some observers is the rapid cooling of economies outside the United States.
Data compiled by Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, shows government borrowing costs, especially for long 30-year maturities, are rising faster than in the United States.
That signals a ""global recession is coming"", Brooks said.
The differential between U.S. and foreign bond yields has shrunk to an average 1.09% this month from 1.6% in January, his data shows. The gap was at 0.67% in July 2020 when central banks were forced to slashed rates as the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Interest rate differentials U.S. vs non-U.S.
The jump in German yields is particularly notable as the European Central Bank prepares to raise rates for the first time in 11 years.
Rate-sensitive two-year German yields are up 67 bps in June, the biggest monthly jump since 1989, while since the start of April they have soared 124 bps, outpacing a 104 bps rise in U.S. two-year yields .
Equivalent yields in Australia are 150 bps higher and in Britain they are up around 75 bps since April.
Goldman's global FCI is at the highest since 2009, indicating financial conditions have tightened by around 335 bps since the start of the year.

46,U.S. Federal Reserve attacks inflation with its largest rate hike since 1994,2022-06-15T07:00:00Z,The central bank is ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four-decade high of 8.6 per cent.,"WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve on Wednesday intensified its drive to tame high inflation by raising its key interest rate by three-quarters of a point — its largest hike in nearly three decades — and signalling more large rate increases to come that would raise the risk of another recession.
The move the Fed announced after its latest policy meeting will increase its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
The central bank is ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four-decade high of 8.6%, spreading to more areas of the economy and showing no sign of slowing. Americans are also starting to expect high inflation to last longer than they had before. This sentiment could embed an inflationary psychology in the economy that would make it harder to bring inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.
The Fed’s three-quarter-point rate increase exceeds the half-point hike that Chair Jerome Powell had previously suggested was likely to be announced this week. The Fed’s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did Wednesday was an acknowledgment that it’s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation, which has been worsened by Russia’s war against Ukraine and its effects on energy prices.
Borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the U.S. economy in response to the Fed’s moves, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate topping 6%, its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, up from just 3% at the start of the year. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, a benchmark for corporate borrowing, has jumped to 3.3%, its highest level since 2007.
Even if a recession can be avoided, economists say it’s almost inevitable that the Fed will have to inflict some pain — most likely in the form of higher unemployment — as the price of defeating chronically high inflation.
Inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before Congress’ midterm elections, souring the public’s view of the economy, weakening President Joe Biden’s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of Democratic losses in November. Biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing American households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference. The president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the Fed.
Yet the Fed’s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth. Shortages of oil, gasoline and food are propelling inflation. The Fed isn’t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation, which involve Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, still-clogged global supply chains, labour shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals.
Expectations for larger Fed hikes have sent a range of interest rates to their highest points in years. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, a benchmark for corporate bonds, has reached 3.3%, its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield, which directly affects mortgage rates, has hit 3.4%, up nearly a half-point since last week and the highest level since 2011.
Investments around the world, from bonds to bitcoin, have tumbled in recent months on fears surrounding high inflation and the prospect that the Fed’s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession. Even if the Fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a recession, higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stock prices. The S&P 500 has already sunk more than 20% this year, meeting the definition of a bear market.
Other central banks around the world are also acting swiftly to try to quell surging inflation, even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the U.S. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter-point in July, its first increase in 11 years. It could announce a larger hike in September if record-high levels of inflation persist. On Wednesday, the ECB vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago.
The Bank of England has raised rates four times since December to a 13-year high, despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter. The BOE will hold an interest rate meeting on Thursday.
The 19 European Union countries that use the euro currency endured record inflation of 8.1% last month. The United Kingdom notched a 40-year high of 9% in April. Though debt service costs remain contained for now, rising borrowing costs for indebted governments threatened the eurozone with a breakup in the early part of the last decade.
Last week, the World Bank warned of the threat of “stagflation” — slow growth accompanied by high inflation — around the world.
A key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the Fed to slow inflation to its 2% target, it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending, wage gains and economic growth. Ultimately, the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise — something the Fed hasn’t yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue Wednesday.

BEIJING – Asian stock markets were mixed while Europe opened higher Wednesday ahead of a Federal Reserve decision on how sharply to raise interest rates to cool U.S. inflation.
London, Frankfurt and Shanghai advanced. Tokyo and Sydney declined. Oil prices edged lower.
Wall Street futures were higher after the benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.4% on Tuesday.
Traders expect the Fed rate hike to be three-quarters of a percentage point, or triple the usual margin. They worry aggressive action to cool inflation that is running at a four-decade high might tip the biggest global economy into recession.
A “hawkish surprise” from the Fed could be a “further shock to risk assets,"" Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a report. “Money markets are already pricing around 90% possibility of such action.”
In early trading, the FTSE 100 in London rose 1.1% to 7,262.53 and Frankfurt's DAX gained 1.4% to 13,498.03. The CAC 40 in Paris advanced 1.4% to 6,033.15.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 future gained 0.8% and that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7%.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 lost 0.4%. It closed Monday at 21.8% below its Jan. 3 peak. That puts it in a bear market, or a drop of 20% from the last market top.
The Dow fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%.
The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5% Wednesday to 3,305.41 after government data showed Chinese factory activity rebounded in May as anti-virus controls that shut down businesses in Shanghai and other industrial centers eased.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.1% to 21,308.21 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo lost 1.1% to 26,326.16.
The Kospi in Seoul shed 1.8% to 2,447.538 after South Korea's unemployment rate in May ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 2.8%.
Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 sank 1.3% to 6,601.00.
India's Sensex gained less than 0.1% at 52,728.02. New Zealand, Jakarta and Bangkok declined while Singapore advanced.

NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Bond investors are embracing safety in their portfolios as volatile markets price in a super-sized hike from the Federal Reserve following evidence of scorching inflation.
Investors have drastically shifted their expectations about Wednesday's decision to a rate hike of 75 basis points (bps) - not the 50 bps the market was expecting last week. The increased hawkishness has sent equity markets tumbling and bond yields surging, briefly inverting the yield curve and pushing stocks into a bear market. read more
Many investors support the Fed moving faster to dampen inflation, but they worry about the risk of recession.

""A surprise 75 basis-point hike would be a happy one,"" said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona.
""The question is whether the economy can avoid recession and that would depend on what the Fed does. If the Fed raised by 50 and they say they're willing to consider 75, then we know that they're not going to get ahead of inflation. You need to front-end load the hikes.""
Tengler said her firm has been ""defensive"" in its bond portfolios, shortening duration and increasing the underlying quality of the assets.
Shorter-duration debt typically outperforms longer-dated debt in a rising rate environment.
Overall, futures on the fed funds rate, or the rate on unsecured overnight loans between banks, now reflect an 87% chance of a 75 bps rate hike on Wednesday, and a 75% probability of another such increase in July . The market has also factored in a fed funds rate of 4% by the summer next year.
Pershing Square Capital Management founder and chief executive officer Bill Ackman, in comments on Twitter on Tuesday, pushed for multiple 75 bps hikes, noting that market confidence in the Fed can only be restored if it delivers on what the market expects.

The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year. It also began to shrink its balance sheet this month, a process called quantitative tightening. The Fed's balance sheet ballooned to nearly $9 trillion as part of its pandemic policy accommodation
The recent big spike in inflation was a major catalyst to the shift in expectations. Last Friday, data showed that in the 12 months through May, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.6%, the largest year-on-year increase in roughly 40 years. read more

BOND MARKET BETS
Ahead of the Fed decision, fixed income market players have kept short duration bets.
Some, however, have reduced those short-maturity trades, believing there are opportunities in the market given how credit spreads have widened and how rates have risen significantly since the beginning of the year.
""We are still short duration albeit to a lesser degree. We have been upgrading the quality of our portfolios under the premise that choppier markets and tighter monetary policies should cause credit spreads to widen,"" said R.J. Gallo, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes in Pittsburgh.
His portfolios are also slightly overweight Treasuries and even though their duration is short, ""we still like the high-quality nature of Treasuries for playing defense.""
But despite the Fed's aggressive tightening, bond investors see opportunities in the fixed income space and for some, it may be time to start moving away from safety bets.
""At this point, being incredibly conservative from both a credit and duration standpoint is not the right place to be,"" said Jason Brady, chief executive officer at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, overseeing $46 billion in assets.
""That's where we were and we're moving away from that.""
From a credit spread standpoint, Brady said his firm has become marginally less conservative.
Brady, for instance, cited U.S. high yield debt, with its spread to Treasuries widening to 487 basis points on Monday. On top of a 3.5% yield in U.S. five-year Treasuries, he noted that an investor would net a more than 7% yield, which is ""not terrible.""
David Petrosinelli, managing director at broker-dealer InspereX in New York, has also been advising investors to be defensive in bond portfolios since the fourth quarter of last year, but still believes the Fed could slow the pace of tightening later this year.
He recommends a barbell strategy, which combines short and long maturity bonds. If rates rise, the investor will have the opportunity to reinvest the proceeds of the shorter-term securities at the higher rate.
Petrosinelli believes the Fed's aggressive hikes this year will lead to a dramatic tail-off in consumption by end-2022.
""That's going to slow the Fed down in the fourth quarter in terms of hiking rates. They will still need to raise rates, but the magnitude is going to decline quickly.""

NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Despite a crushing selloff that pushed U.S. stocks into a bear market, investors see few signs suggesting equities have hit bottom, as persistent worries over surging inflation and an aggressive Federal Reserve continue to pressure asset prices.
The market’s losses have been steep. The 21.3% year-to-date decline in the S&P 500 as of Monday wiped out some $8.7 trillion in market value this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. read more
Meanwhile, the highest inflation rise in four decades has investors pricing in a once-unthinkable 75 basis-point rate increase at the Fed’s monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, and worries are growing that the central bank won’t be able to tame consumer prices without tipping the economy into a recession. read more

Some strategists, however, are not convinced that all the factors are in place to mark the end of the declines.
“This is not necessarily what a bottom looks like,"" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. ""It is perhaps what a bottoming process looks like.”
Reuters Graphics
The S&P 500 on Tuesday ended down 22.1% from its Jan 3 record peak. The average decline for bear markets since 1946 has been 32.7%, according to investment research firm CFRA, which may suggest the current slide may have more room to run.
Similarly, the average bear market has lasted 389 calendar days from the peak to the bottom, more than twice as long as the current bear slide.
Hackett and other market participants are also watching a number of technical signs indicating that selling in stocks may have reached a crescendo.
One of the more famous indicators is the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which is known as “Wall Street’s fear gauge” and measures the expectation of stock-market volatility as expressed by options prices.
Since 1990, the volatility index has reached an average level of 37 at market bottoms, and spiked to 85 during the market’s coronavirus-fueled swoon of March 2020. By contrast, the VIX rose to 35.05 during Monday’s selloff: above its long-term median of about 18, but still below peak levels in other bear markets.
“It feels like investors are less panicked and more resigned to the fact that the next 6-12 months is going to be a slog (and elevated volatility is here to stay longer),” wrote Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, commenting on VIX contracts going out into the next year.
Vol index above its median
Still, volume on puts, which investors use to protect their portfolios from stock declines, hit 2.03 million contracts on Monday, the highest level since Fed 28, 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
Some also watch indicators on investor sentiment, with the hopes of potentially swooping into the markets when pessimism is high and selling is becoming exhausted.
Many such indicators show sentiment has soured. The latest weekly survey of the American Association of Individual Investors, for example, found bearish sentiment at 46.9% – topping its long term average of 30.5% but still below levels from earlier this year.
Those readings came before the higher-than-expected inflation reading on Friday that sent stocks tumbling and could sour investor sentiment further.
Reuters Graphics
“Investor sentiment has been negative for a while now and that is a sign telling us we might be getting there as a bottom but we are not quite there yet,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Technical indicators aside, Kourkafas said it will be difficult for the market to fully bottom until investors are confident inflation has ebbed, allowing the Fed to ease back on its monetary tightening.
Others, however, are urging investors to focus on the long-term. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, notes that less than 5% of S&P 500 stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average. read more
That's only happened nine times since 1990, and the S&P 500 was up in every single case a year later, with an average gain of 23%.
""Given the market is already pricing in a high probability of recession, that stocks are very oversold on several metrics, that valuations (while not cheap) have been reset, and sentiment is depressed, we would not reduce equities,"" he wrote in a Tuesday report.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's top officials and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were quick to dismiss the first embers of inflation in the spring of 2021 in a single word: Transitory.
More than a year later, price increases at 40-year peaks have proven to be anything but, so much so that the Fed this week appears ready to hike interest rates by the most since 1994 to quell them. Biden, meanwhile, is paying the political price for being the face Americans blame for $5 a gallon gas and 10% price increases for eggs.
In truth, the culprits contributing to the current U.S. inflation are numerous. Fiscal spending likely went a step too far; a red-hot job market lifted worker pay the most in a generation; global supply shocks kept coming instead of easing; the war in Ukraine created food and fuel scarcities.
Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register
But both the Fed and Biden administration were slow to shift their focus from fighting the economic shock of the pandemic, particularly on employment, to controlling inflation that is so acute the central bank is willing to court a recession to fix it.
By mid-summer 2021, the pandemic employment hole was still nearly 7 million jobs, but price increases were already running at their highest in a decade and twice the Fed's 2% a year target. Biden and Powell each referred to ""transitory"" inflation within days of each other that July. Biden did so in a speech marking his first six months in office and Powell in his press conference following that month's Fed policy meeting.
By September, the Fed appeared to finally take note, when it signaled the labor market conditions it had set for dialing back its bond purchases - the first step toward higher rates - would soon be met. The consumer price index then had climbed by more than 5% year-on-year, belying expectations for an easing.
When the Fed actually started reducing its asset purchases in November it would be north of 6%.
Consumers noticed as well. A measure of near-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan that month hit its highest since 2008.
That presented the first inklings of a new and deeper problem.
High inflation becoming rooted in public psychology is something Fed officials have feared as it lowers obstacles for companies to raise prices, keeps consumers spending furiously, and undermines the Fed's own credibility as an inflation fighter.
Indeed, that risk - which has only grown this year - is now central to the rapid change in the Fed's posture. read more ""As soon as (inflation) expectations move, you have to hit like a hammer. Do more and do it quick. That is where we are,"" said Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor and chief executive of LHMeyer, referring to the prospect of a three quarter point Fed rate hike this week.
THE BIDEN RESPONSE
For its part, the White House in mid-2021 created a task force to deal with supply chain snarls, thick with retail and logistics company leaders, tried to stamp down rising oil prices with releases from the strategic petroleum reserve and focused on anti-competitive practices in key industries.
In December, Biden declared victory over empty shelves, seconded by FedEx Corp (FDX.N) chief executive Fred Smith.
But inflation did not respond, prompting Biden in the fall to double down on his big plan to fix it. The Build Back Better Act aimed hundreds of billions of dollars in investment at reducing health care, housing, childcare and prescription drug costs, among other issues.
Instead, it died in Congress after negotiations failed between the White House, and progressive Democrats and hold out senators.
By May of this year, Biden was highlighting the role the Fed, not the White House, would play in reducing inflation, while promising to look at tariffs on goods from China and other issues that could have some impact.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a key promoter of the term ""transitory,"" publicly retired it in December, but she continued to reassure White House officials privately early this year that price pressures would ease in 2022. It was not until this month that she admitted her mistake. read more
White House officials now privately acknowledge they may have little control over price hikes ahead of the crucial November mid-terms, and would do what they could on the margins, while continuing to lay the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine that sent fuel and food costs sky-rocketing further. read more
BACK TO THE FED
Once Fed officials this year fully embraced that the situation had changed, their response took on increasing urgency as the clamor grew from financial market actors and other critics that they were woefully behind the curve.
They accelerated the end of their bond purchases and in March raised the benchmark short term federal funds rate for the first time since 2018, by a quarter percentage point.
But even then, policymakers' projections signaled what, by historical standards, would be a modest rise in the federal funds rate to around 1.9% by the end of the year, with no change in unemployment from the current low rate of 3.6%.
In early May, they raised rates again, by half a point this time, and for weeks afterward touted a plan to raise them by that margin again at meetings in June and July.
Since then, the outlook on prices has eroded further, with annual consumer inflation as of May accelerating to 8.6%, and persistently high prices now amounting to a generational shock. Stock markets have sunk into a full-on bear market on worries that the Fed's small steps will no longer be enough, and bond yields most sensitive to central bank policy expectations have shot to their highest since 2007.
When data on Friday showed a jump in consumers' expectations about inflation, coupled with a similar outcome in a Monday New York Fed survey, it may have convinced Fed officials that their pledge to tame prices had not yet registered - to either the public or financial markets. read more
Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard University professor, said Fed officials were paying the price for policy that promised to fight inflation but lacked any firm commitment to push rates to restrictive levels.
""It is hard to convince people you are going to do serious things next year when you are not going to do them this year,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday intensified its drive to tame high inflation by raising its key interest rate by three-quarters of a point — its largest hike in nearly three decades — and signaling more large rate increases to come that would raise the risk of another recession.
The move the Fed announced after its latest policy meeting will increase its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
The central bank is ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four-decade high of 8.6%, spreading to more areas of the economy and showing no sign of slowing. Americans are also starting to expect high inflation to last longer than they had before. This sentiment could embed an inflationary psychology in the economy that would make it harder to bring inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.
The Fed’s three-quarter-point rate increase exceeds the half-point hike that Chair Jerome Powell had previously suggested was likely to be announced this week. The Fed’s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did Wednesday was an acknowledgment that it’s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation, which has been worsened by Russia’s war against Ukraine and its effects on energy prices.
Borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the U.S. economy in response to the Fed’s moves, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate topping 6%, its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, up from just 3% at the start of the year. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, a benchmark for corporate borrowing, has jumped to 3.3%, its highest level since 2007.
Even if a recession can be avoided, economists say it’s almost inevitable that the Fed will have to inflict some pain — most likely in the form of higher unemployment — as the price of defeating chronically high inflation.
Inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before Congress’ midterm elections, souring the public’s view of the economy, weakening President Joe Biden’s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of Democratic losses in November. Biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing American households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference. The president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the Fed.
Yet the Fed’s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth. Shortages of oil, gasoline and food are propelling inflation. The Fed isn’t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation, which involve Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, still-clogged global supply chains, labor shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals.
Expectations for larger Fed hikes have sent a range of interest rates to their highest points in years. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, a benchmark for corporate bonds, has reached 3.3%, its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield, which directly affects mortgage rates, has hit 3.4%, up nearly a half-point since last week and the highest level since 2011.
Investments around the world, from bonds to bitcoin, have tumbled in recent months on fears surrounding high inflation and the prospect that the Fed’s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession. Even if the Fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a recession, higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stock prices. The S&P 500 has already sunk more than 20% this year, meeting the definition of a bear market.
Other central banks around the world are also acting swiftly to try to quell surging inflation, even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the U.S. The European Central Bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter-point in July, its first increase in 11 years. It could announce a larger hike in September if record-high levels of inflation persist. On Wednesday, the ECB vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago.
The Bank of England has raised rates four times since December to a 13-year high, despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter. The BOE will hold an interest rate meeting on Thursday.
The 19 European Union countries that use the euro currency endured record inflation of 8.1% last month. The United Kingdom notched a 40-year high of 9% in April. Though debt service costs remain contained for now, rising borrowing costs for indebted governments threatened the eurozone with a breakup in the early part of the last decade.
Last week, the World Bank warned of the threat of “stagflation” — slow growth accompanied by high inflation — around the world.
A key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the Fed to slow inflation to its 2% target, it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending, wage gains and economic growth. Ultimately, the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise — something the Fed hasn’t yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue Wednesday.",https://www.wbrz.com/news/fed-attacks-inflation-with-its-largest-rate-hike-since-1994

Some traders would not be shocked to see a ¾ point hike given the recent economic data.,"July corn futures are 7 cents higher while December is up 2. The December contract found solid resistance at the Monday high, which coincides closely with the 50-day average today. If the corn bulls are going to mount a rally ahead of the three day weekend, they will need to post a convincing move through this resistance and etch a solid close.
Soybean prices are quietly mixed at mid-day. The July contract did push over the $17 mark briefly but has since backed off to steady on the day. November futures are up a nickel near the $15.30 mark. The key price to watch for today is the 20-day average at $15.32. A close over this line would briefly give the bulls a shot of momentum. If the bears take control and make new lows, the next level of support is the 50-day average at $15.09.
Wheat futures are mixed after a softer start to the day. CBOT is up 1, KC is down a nickel and spring wheat is still down a dime. All three classes of wheat have made lower lows than last week. The next major level of support in the wheat market is the June 1 low. Below those lows, we are likely headed to the early May lows.
Livestock prices are mostly higher at mid-day. Feeder cattle are up $2.20, live cattle are up $3.02. Lean hogs are up 65 cents in July and down 20 in August.
The dollar index has climbed back to nearly steady on the day. Crude oil has drifted lower throughout the trading day. July crude is down $1.32 at $117.61. July RBOB gasoline briefly broke below the $4 mark today, which is more than 30 cents off the high hit four days ago. Key level to watch today in the July RBOB is $3.96 as that is the 20-day average.
OPENING COMMENTS: 9:10 A.M.
Corn prices are trying to turn the tides and push into higher territory this morning.
July and December contracts are bouncing above and below the steady mark. July soybeans are down 3 cents, and November is up 3 cents. CBOT wheat is a dime off the low but is still down 3 cents. KC and spring wheat are both down 10 cents.
Livestock prices jolted higher right out of the gates this morning. August feeder cattle are up $1.82. June live cattle are up $2.55, and July lean hogs are up $1.05. The June live cattle contract gapped higher on the chart and is at the highest level in nearly two months.
The U.S. dollar index is quietly lower this morning after pushing to the 105.47 mark yesterday. Last trade on the dollar is 105.12, which is down 0.21.
Crude oil futures are weaker again this morning, following the late session selling seen on Tuesday. July crude is down 70 cents at $118.23. There should be strong support for crude at $116.62 (yesterdays low) and $115.85 (20-day average). If prices slip through these levels and close below them, the bears could quickly pick up momentum to the downside.
Traders are going to closely watch the Federal Reserve board rate decision today. The market is expecting to see a ½ point increase today. Some traders would not be shocked to see a ¾ point hike given the recent economic data.

Key Facts
Stocks were slightly higher on Wednesday after five losing sessions in a row: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, nearly 100 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 1.2%. The market gave up most of its gains in the afternoon, however, after the Federal Reserve announced it would raise interest rates by 75 basis points, the biggest increase since 1994. “Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures,” Fed officials said in a statement. Investors had been betting on a 75-basis-point increase, rather than the previously expected 50-basis-point hike, after a much-hotter-than-expected inflation report last week showed consumer prices jumping 8.6% in May compared to a year ago. The last time the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points was under the leadership of Alan Greenspan in November 1994, when the central bank orchestrated a soft landing and avoided a recession despite hiking rates seven times in 13 months. Rates on government bonds moderated somewhat on Wednesday after surging higher earlier in the week, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields recently hitting their highest levels since 2007 and 2011, respectively.
Crucial Quote:
“Don’t be fooled by this Wed. morning rally—the overall attitude is still very gloomy, and most people look at a recession and further equity downside as being inevitable,” says Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli. “The one area of anxiety concerns bear market rallies and there is a worry that one may happen at some point this week around the Fed (most people think any such rally will be ephemeral but violent).”
What To Watch For:
While markets were expecting a 75-basis-point rate hike by the Fed, the press conference following the release of the statement this afternoon will help analysts “assess the Fed’s ability to navigate Chairman Powell’s so-called softish landing as it takes a more aggressive approach in stanching inflation,” says Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial.
Tangent:
The price of Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell to around $21,000 as the cryptocurrency market continues to be hard-hit by a massive selloff this week as several firms halted exchanges or announced layoffs in what experts are calling a “crypto winter.”
Key Background:
The benchmark S&P 500 fell deeper into bear market territory on Tuesday, now sitting roughly 22% below its record highs in January. All three major averages are coming off the back of their worst down week since January, falling by roughly 5% or more after last week’s red-hot inflation report led to a spike in recession fears.

58,Fed Attacks Inflation with Its Largest Rate Hike Since 1994,2022-06-15T04:00:00Z,The Federal Reserve intensified its drive to tame high inflation by raising its key interest rate by three-quarters of a point — its largest hike in nearly three decades.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday intensified its drive to tame high inflation by raising its key interest rate by three-quarters of a point — its largest hike in nearly three decades — and signaling more large rate increases to come that would raise the risk of another recession.
The move the Fed announced after its latest policy meeting will increase its benchmark short-term rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
The central bank is ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four-decade high of 8.6%, spreading to more areas of the economy and showing no sign of slowing. Americans are also starting to expect high inflation to last longer than they had before. This sentiment could embed an inflationary psychology in the economy that would make it harder to bring inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.
The Fed’s three-quarter-point rate increase exceeds the half-point hike that Chair Jerome Powell had previously suggested was likely to be announced this week. The Fed’s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did Wednesday was an acknowledgment that it’s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation, which has been worsened by Russia’s war against Ukraine and its effects on energy prices.
Borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the U.S. economy in response to the Fed’s moves, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate topping 6%, its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis, up from just 3% at the start of the year. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note, a benchmark for corporate borrowing, has jumped to 3.3%, its highest level since 2007.
Even if a recession can be avoided, economists say it’s almost inevitable that the Fed will have to inflict some pain — most likely in the form of higher unemployment — as the price of defeating chronically high inflation.

Key Facts
The average interest rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage home loan now sits at over 6.2%, its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis and up from around 5.5% a week ago. Existing home sales and mortgage applications have both taken a hit amid rising interest rates and looming recession fears as the median monthly payment on a new 30-year mortgage rose more than 50% since last year, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs. Today’s housing bubble is the “Achilles Heel” that could “put a torpedo into the side of the U.S. economy,” especially as metrics such as home builder confidence and traffic of prospective buyers continue to plunge, predicts James Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management. New data on Wednesday from the National Association of Home Builders showed that home builder confidence declined for a six months in a row, falling to its lowest level in two years as surging inflation and high mortgage rates price buyers out of the market. Traffic of prospective buyers, meanwhile, also hit its lowest level since June 2020, with new buyers hard-hit by “declines for housing affordability,” according to NAHB chairman Jerry Konter. What’s more, home purchase applications are down 15% from last year as record-low housing stock, rising prices and the run-up in interest rates impact demand, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday.
Crucial Quote:
“We’ve already seen mortgage applications falling in double digits year over year, and existing home sales are likely to follow suit over the next several months,” says Ruben Gonzalez, chief economist at Keller Williams. “Mortgage rates going forward will continue to be responsive to changes in expectations around the Fed’s policy path, as well as inflation expectations,” he predicts.
Key Background:
With the Federal Reserve scrambling to aggressively raise interest rates in a bid to combat inflation—implementing another 75-basis-point increase on Wednesday, home buying has become notably more expensive. “The current red-hot housing market will cool off, and some house price declines are likely,” says Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi. Additional increases in mortgage rates will only “amplify downside risk” for the housing market, which could have significant implications for the rest of the economy, according to Goldman strategists.

60,Federal Reserve escalates inflation fight with biggest rate hike since 1994,2022-06-15T04:00:00Z,The central bank raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point and said it’s ‘strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.’,"What the Fed did: Wrapping up a regularly scheduled two-day meeting in Washington D.C., central bank officials said in a statement that they voted to boost the benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage point. The rate increase, to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent, will push up borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, as well as for companies taking loans to hire and expand operations.
The Federal Reserve ratcheted up its fight against inflation on Wednesday with its biggest interest rate hike since 1994, after government data released last week showed consumer prices are climbing faster than expected.

The decision marked an abrupt change in the Fed’s plans: Jerome Powell and his colleagues on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had raised rates twice this year, in March and May, as it became clear that inflation was more than a temporary problem caused by the pandemic. Until last week, officials had signaled they would make more modest half-point increases on Wednesday and at their next meeting, in July.
But on Friday, the Labor Department said that consumer prices in May rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1981. Moreover, two widely followed monthly surveys — one by the University of Michigan released on Friday, the other published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday — showed consumers anticipated inflation remaining well above the Fed’s 2 percent target for the next one- and five-year periods.
Elevated inflation expectations are important: That’s because they can affect actual prices. As Tyler Powell and David Wessel explained in a Brookings Institution blog post, “If everyone expects prices to rise, say, 3 percent over the next year, businesses will want to raise prices by (at least) 3 percent, and workers and their unions will want similar-sized raises.”

The inflation data and survey results apparently were enough to prompt the Fed to move more aggressively than it had planned.
In a statement, the Fed said it was “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.” Officials removed language used in prior statements that said the FOMC “expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong.”
The Fed had to carefully weigh the impact of changing its guidance: If officials had stuck with a half-point increase, there was the risk they’d been seen as too timid on inflation. The heftier hike, on the other hand, may be taken as a sign that the situation has grown more dire. Also, breaking with their widely telegraphed half-point increase may call into doubt the reliability of future Fed guidance on interest rates.
Interest rates are the Fed’s most powerful tool to control inflation: The central bank’s intention is to reduce consumer spending, thus relieving pressure on prices. The danger is that consumers, whose spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the economy, retrench too deeply, leading to a downturn and rising unemployment.
Projections are revised: The Fed released a new quarterly round of FOMC members’ economic forecasts.
Inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is expected to be 5.2 percent for the year, according to the median of the officials’ forecasts. That up from 4.3 percent in their March estimates.
Gross domestic product. Officials see the economy expanding by 1.7 percent this year, down from the March estimate of 2.8 percent.
Unemployment. The jobless rate was pegged at 3.7 percent for the year, compared with an estimate of 3.5 percent three months ago.
Fed funds rate: FOMC members see the benchmark rate rising to 3.4 percent. In March, their estimate was 1.9 percent.
Markets react: Stocks gave up some of their earlier gains immediately following the 2 p.m. release of the Fed’s statement. But prices took off after Powell began speaking at his news conference 30 minutes later. The Dow Jones average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index were up about 1 percent, while the Nasdaq gained 2.4 percent, at just before 3 p.m.

Key Facts
“Now is the time to aggressively pay down high-cost credit cards,"" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said in emailed comments, pointing out nearly all credit cards come with variable interest rates that fluctuate in tandem with the federal funds rate determined by the Fed. Fueled by the Fed’s hikes, mortgage rates have surged to the highest level since the Great Recession, climbing from nearly 3.8% at the beginning of the year to more than 6% last week—and pushing the average monthly mortgage payment up by about $600. As a result, many mortgage lending businesses are already suffering from sinking demand, and NerdWallet's Holden Lewis says that should “soon” usher in a slowdown in home price increases, though the dearth in available homes for sale (still one-third of normal levels) will likely help keep prices fairly elevated. Though federal student loans are doled out with fixed rates (meaning existing loans won’t be affected), private loans—which represent about 8% of the market with some $131 billion in loans outstanding—often come with variable rates that tick up after Fed hikes. A couple of rate increases alone likely won’t have a considerable effect on smaller-ticket items including auto financing, but major banks—including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan—on Wednesday started raising their prime interest rates, which are used to calculate loan costs, to 4.75%, compared to roughly 3.25% two years prior. One bright spot? ""The outlook for savers is getting better,"" says McBride, pointing out high-yielding savings accounts and certificates of deposit will raise payouts even though most banks ""are likely to be stingy about passing along higher rates.""
Crucial Quote
“Rising interest rates mean borrowing costs more, and eventually savings will earn more,” says McBride, adding that households should be taking steps to “stabilize their finances,” including paying down costly credit cards and other variable-rate debt, and boosting emergency savings. “Both will enable you to better weather rising interest rates, and whatever might come next economically.”
News Peg
At the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting Wednesday afternoon, Fed officials said the central bank would raise the federal funds rate, which is the target interest rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend reserves, by 75 basis points to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%—the largest hike since 1994 after a 50-basis-point increase last month. Experts only started expecting the hike after last month's annual inflation reading unexpectedly hit a 40-year high of 8.6%.
What To Watch For
Though he previously ruled out a 75-basis-point hike, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said another such increase was on the table for July 27, when the central bank’s next policy meeting concludes.
Big Number
$15.9 trillion. That's how much debt American households held at the end of last quarter—the highest amount ever, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Though most of it is contained in fixed-rate housing debt, the overall figure has climbed at the quickest pace in 14 years as fast-rising home and auto prices helped tack more more than $1 trillion in debt over the past year.

The Federal Reserve is set to announce an interest rate raise on Wednesday to combat 41-year-high inflation, but experts are conflicted on how aggressive the rate hike will be.
Some analysts say that the Fed could be extremely aggressive in the move, with consumer prices soaring. For example, ""Bond King"" Jeff Gundlach urged the Fed to immediately raise interest rates to 3%, while Bill Ackman called for rapid-fire hikes of 100 basis points.
Last month, policymakers raised the target range for the federal funds rate a half point to 0.75% to 1%. Bond yields have soared in recent days on expectations of a more hawkish Fed. On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit an 11-year high of 3.48%.
While there isn't a consensus among the top banks on Wall Street, most have put forth predictions. From Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, here's what top firms expect the central bank to do today.
Goldman Sachs: 75 basis points
The Wall Street giant warned the chances of a US recession are rising, and it expects the Fed to raise rates by 75 basis points at the next two meetings.
Additionally, Goldman's analysts expect the Fed's target federal funds rate to peak at 3.25-3.5%, around 50 basis points below what the rest of the market expects.
Jefferies: 75 basis points
Jefferies upped its call from 50 basis points after the May inflation reading hit a 41-year high.
""[We] have increased our Fed rate call to 75bps from 50bps at this meeting as we not only think the Fed SHOULD hike but that they actually WILL hike by that order of magnitude,"" Brad Bechtel, the global head of FX at Jefferies, said in a note released Monday.
Barclays: 75 basis points
Economists at Barclays echoed Jefferies and Goldman Sachs' predictions.
""[W]e think the US central bank now has good reason to surprise markets by hiking more aggressively."" Still, ""we realize it is a close call and that it could play out in either June or July,"" analysts wrote in a note after the release of the consumer-price index for May.
JPMorgan: 75 basis points
JPMorgan's chief US economist wrote in a Monday note that an increase of 100 basis points is also a ""non-trivial"" risk, Bloomberg reported.
Deutsche Bank: 75 basis points
Analysts said in a report on Tuesday that they expect 75-point hikes both today and in July, highlighting that there's a ""need for speed"" in battling inflation.
Bank of America: 50 basis points
BofA expects two hikes of 50 basis points each at the Wednesday and July meetings, respectively, according to Reuters.
Citi: 50 basis points

Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged lower in early European trade Wednesday, consolidating near a 20-year high ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy which is expected to result in more aggressive monetary tightening.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.4% lower at 104.880, having climbed to 105.65 on Tuesday, its strongest since late 2002.
The Fed signaled at its meeting in May that half-point increases were very likely at its following two meetings, but expectations have been rising in the wake of Friday’s red-hot U.S. report that it will act even more aggressively this week, and raise its by at least three-quarters of one point.
Market pricing indicates a 95% chance of a 75 basis point , according to the CME's Fedwatch tool, up from only 3.9% a week ago.
“My two cents worth is that the Fed will not go 100bps, as that would further erode their credibility on the forward guidance front, which is already ragged,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at OANDA.
“They may, however, decide to upgrade their forward guidance to an even more hawkish tilt. I suspect 75bps is already built into prices now, and if the guidance is more modest in scope, I am sure the buy-the-dippers will be out in force for the rest of the week.”
rose 0.5% to 1.0470, rebounding from the one-month low seen overnight after it was announced that the European Central Bank’s will hold a meeting later Wednesday “to discuss current market conditions.”
This meeting comes after the spreads between the yields of Germany and more indebted southern nations, particularly Italy, soared to its highest in over two years in the wake of the ECB’s announcement that it intends to start lifting interest rates in July.
fell 0.6% to 134.66, with the yen making something of a recovery after the pair soared to a fresh 24-year low of 135.58 in early trade.
Helping the yen has been the drifting lower of U.S. Treasury yields, with dipping to 3.40% from Tuesday's peak of 3.498%, while the stood at 3.34%, after touching the highest since 2007 at 3.456% overnight.
The holds its latest policy meeting on Friday, and faces a dilemma of trying to support its currency while trying to boost a struggling economy.
“A 100bps hike [by the Fed] tonight, and/or a very hawkish outlook, will lift USD/JPY once again and may force the BOJ into lifting the 10-year JGB yield cap slightly,” added Halley.

67,Lowe prompts double jump in rate forecasts,2022-06-15T02:28:24Z,Economists and markets have sharpened their expectations for aggressive interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve and RBA to control rampant inflation.,"Economists from Goldman Sachs were among those on Wednesday morning that cited Lowe’s comments as the reason to increase their predictions for the July meeting to 50 basis points from 25 basis points.
The investment bank was one of the few to correctly tip last week’s increase and now expects additional 50 basis point rate rises in August and September. Before Tuesday, it had pencilled in 25 basis point increases at both meetings.
Goldman Sachs forecasts would lift the cash rate to 2.35 per cent by September before the pace slows with the RBA delivering 25 basis point increases each month from October to December.
“We interpreted the substance and timing of governor Lowe’s comments as consistent with a more front-loaded tightening cycle,” said Andrew Boak, Goldman’s chief economist for Australia and New Zealand.
“We view the balance of risks to our revised forecast as skewed to the hawkish side and note that larger 75 basis point rate increases over the coming months cannot be ruled out.”
Economists at JPMorgan also revised their expectations on Wednesday for an increase at the July meeting of 50 basis points from 25 basis points, citing “Lowe’s increased confidence” to quickly raise rates.

Australian bond yields surged higher on Wednesday following Lowe’s hawkish comments, with the three-year bond leaping 43 basis points to a decade high 3.7 per cent – its largest single move since 2009.
The 10-year yield briefly topped 4 per cent for the first time since April 2014 before settling at 3.9 per cent on Wednesday morning.
Financial markets are also bracing for a more aggressive tightening cycle from the Federal Reserve, which is set to increase rates early on Thursday morning in Sydney time.
Mega rate rise a ‘non-trivial risk’
A report in The Wall Street Journal indicated that Fed officials were considering a 75 basis point increase following the two-day monetary policy meeting.
Goldman viewed the article as a hint from the Federal Reserve’s leadership that a jumbo rate rise is on the cards this week.

The broker revised its forecast to include the same-sized rate increase in July. This would be followed by a 50 basis point lift in September and a further 25 basis point increase in November and December to bring US interest rates to a range of 3.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
An eye-popping 100 basis point increase has even been mooted by some market participants this week, with JPMorgan’s chief US economist, Michael Feroli, arguing such a move was “a non-trivial risk”.
Citi said that while a half percentage point rate jump was likely, it would not be surprised to see Fed chair Jerome Powell “express openness to larger hikes”.
Markets are now fully pricing in a 75 basis point increase for June, with pricing indicating a strong likelihood for a similar move in July but lower odds of such an increase in September.

By bringing forward the expected size of the Fed’s hikes, markets are now also pricing in a rate cut by the end of 2023 and 50 basis points of cuts in the first quarter of 2024.
The three 25 basis point cuts expected within two years is the most since before the global financial crisis, according to Bloomberg.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose as much as 11 basis points overnight to an 11-year high of 3.47 per cent, while two-year yields hit 3.44 per cent, a level last since in 2007.

Investors are betting with near certainty that the Federal Reserve will announce a 75-basis-point rate increase – the largest since November 1994
NEW YORK, USA – World stocks fell for a second day in a row on Tuesday, June 14, while government bond yields and the US dollar clung to multi-year highs, as surging inflation led investors to brace for what could be the largest US interest rate hike in 28 years this week.
Surprisingly strong US inflation data released Friday, June 10, has fueled bets that the Federal Reserve must tighten monetary policy more aggressively to tame soaring prices. Fears that a steady series of rate rises could cause a recession walloped global equities on Monday, June 13.
Investors are betting with near certainty that the Fed will announce a 75-basis-point rate increase – the largest since November 1994 – at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, June 15. It would be this year’s third rate increase following two 50-basis-point hikes.
“A 75-basis-point increase is more consistent with the Fed’s prior desire to ‘expeditiously’ raise rates to neutral,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note to clients on Tuesday, adding that “a restrictive policy stance is necessary to tame inflation.”
The analysts said they expect the Fed to raise rates by another 75 basis points in July, and predict that higher rates will likely bring on a recession in mid-2023.
Recession concerns and uncertainty around the outlook for rates weighed on stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.5% to a 16-1/2-month low, and the S&P 500 slipped 0.38%. The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and managed to eke out gains of 0.18%.
The S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory on Monday after shedding more than 20% since a record close on January 3.
The index now trades at a more attractive valuation of about 17 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, according to data provider Datastream. That is roughly in line with its 10-year ratio average, and compares with a reading of more than 20 before the market correction.
MSCI’s gauge of stocks around the world dropped 0.65% to levels last seen in November 2020, while a pan-European equity index slumped 1.26% to March 2020 lows.
Underscoring rising US rate expectations, two-year Treasury yields rose to 3.4560%, the highest since November 2007, while 10-year Treasury yields struck an 11-year high of 3.4980%.
Markets now see the Fed’s rate hike cycle peaking around 4%, a whopping 100 basis points above the 3% last month.
Eurozone government bond yields also hit multi-year highs, as spreads between core and periphery widened amid concerns about faster policy tightening by central banks.
Investors’ repricing of higher rates has pummeled assets that benefited from rock-bottom interest rates, including stocks, crypto, junk-rated bonds, and emerging markets.
“Quite simply, when we see monetary tightening the order of what we are seeing globally, something is going to break,” said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street.
“Stock markets are reflecting the reality of the first-order effect of tighter financial conditions,” Graf said, predicting more pain with US stock valuations still above COVID-19-era lows.
“I think there are other shoes to drop,” he said.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.59% lower, tracking Wall Street’s losses, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.32%.
Crypto markets, where bitcoin and ether hovered near 18-month lows, have also been drubbed by interest rate expectations and crypto lender Celsius Network’s decision to freeze withdrawals.
Bitcoin, which fell as low as $20,816, recovered somewhat but still ended down 2.7%.
Brent crude futures fell 1.17% to $120.84 a barrel, as investors worried about rate rises crimping demand, and a proposed US tax on oil company profits.
State Street’s Graf did not see recession as inevitable, but said the probability has increased with “monetary tightening and the squeeze on real incomes from commodity prices.”
Rising yields and the flight from risk helped the dollar surge to a 20-year high against a basket of currencies.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.3% after hitting a high of 105.65.
A strong dollar pinned the euro near a one-month low at $1.04160 and pressured the Japanese yen, which hit a new 24-year low at 135.42 against the dollar.
With the Bank of Japan (BOJ) expanding bond purchases on Tuesday and unlikely to budge from its ultra-low rates policy at its meeting on Friday, June 17, a respite for the yen looks unlikely.
“Given Wednesday may see the Fed go 75 bps and flag more, while the BOJ on Friday will only flag more bond buying, the yen is not going to stay at these levels for long. It’s going to get much, much worse,” Rabobank strategist Michael Every said.

A key U.S. currency index, which tracks its performance against six peers, was at 105.3 having hit 105.65 on Tuesday, its strongest since December 2002. Sterling was at $1.20135 after slumping to a 15-month low versus the dollar at $1.1934 the previous day, not helped by the possibility of a new referendum on Scottish independence, while the euro was at $1.0428 just above its overnight one-month low.
Market pricing indicates a 99.7% chance of a 75 basis point rate hike at the Fed's meeting which concludes later on Wednesday, according to the CME's Fedwatch tool, up from only 3.9% a week ago. The sharp pick up in expectations followed media reports, first by the Wall Street Journal that a bigger rate increase was on the cards after data released last week showed the U.S. consumer price index surged 8.6% in the 12 months to May, the largest year-on-year increase in four decades.
The U.S. dollar had already been gaining ground in the past few months thanks to the Fed raising rates ahead of most other major central banks, and has been given another leg up in recent weeks as investors seek safe havens fearing the economic impact of rapidly tightening financial conditions. At least in the near term, analysts feel that the dollar has not much further to go.
""Given current aggressive market pricing, there is a risk the (Fed)is deemed ‘not hawkish enough’, pulling down U.S. interest rates and the USD modestly after the meeting,"" said CBA analysts in a morning note. ""In our view, it will take more than a 75bp hike tomorrow, or a nod to a 100bp hike for the FOMC’s July meeting, to push the USD up significantly after the FOMC meeting.""
Higher U.S. rates versus rock bottom Japanese yields have been weighing on the yen, which hit a fresh 24-year low of 135.58 per dollar in early trade, before recovering to 135.05. Expectations for higher rates have also hurt risk friendly assets such as tech stocks, while in currency markets, the Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for risk appetite, is at $0.68950 near a one-month low.
The Aussie is down 7.9% so far this quarter, which would be its worst quarter since the first three months of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The New Zealand dollar was at $0.62185 just off its two-year low of $0.6197 hit overnight.
Bitcoin, another risk friendly asset class, was down slightly, trading just under $22,000. It hit an 18-month low of $21,800 on Tuesday, also hurt by major crypto lender Celsius Network's freezing withdrawals earlier this week.

(Reuters) - Oil prices dropped on Wednesday on worries over fuel demand ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which is expected to see the central bank to hike rates by at least 75 basis points to combat inflation.
WTI crude futures fell 8 cents, or 0.1%, to $118.85 a barrel by 0008 GMT. Brent crude futures fell 26 cents, or 0.2%, to $120.91 a barrel.
Surging inflation has led investors and oil traders to brace for a big move by the Fed this week - what could be the largest U.S. interest rate hike in 28 years.
On the demand side, China's latest COVID outbreak, traced to a 24-hour bar in Beijing, has raised fears of a new phase of lockdowns.
In its monthly report, the Organization of the PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) stuck to its forecast that world oil demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022, but said Russia's invasion of Ukraine - Moscow calls is actions a ""special operation"" - and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic pose a considerable risk.
The producers' group sees demand growth slowing next year, OPEC delegates and industry sources told Reuters, as surging oilprices help drive up inflation and act as a drag on the globaleconomy.
Still, offering some support to prices is tight supply, which has been aggravated by a drop in exports from Libya amid a political crisis that has hit output and ports.
