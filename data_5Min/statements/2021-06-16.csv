 short-term funding markets."

 implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar 
 funding markets."

 day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the 
 discretion of the Chair."

 holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from 
 the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency 
 MBS."

 reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons."
