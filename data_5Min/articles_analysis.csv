 Federal Reserve officials will conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday, and they are widely expected to keep interest rates steady at a two-decade high when they release their policy decision at 2 p.m.
 
 But investors are likely to closely watch the meeting — particularly Chair Jerome H. Powell’s 2:30 p.m. news conference — for hints of when policymakers might begin to lower interest rates. The Fed has held its policy rate in a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent since July, and officials projected in December that they might lower borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point over the course of 2024.
 
 But both the timing and the magnitude of those rate cuts remain uncertain. On the one hand, inflation has come down more swiftly than many economists had expected in recent months. On the other, economic growth is proving stronger than anticipated, which could give companies the wherewithal to keep raising prices into the future.
 
 Here’s what to know about this meeting.
 
 The Fed’s statement could change.
 The Fed’s post-meeting policy statement has suggested that officials will watch economic data “in determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate.” Now that further rate increases are looking less and less likely, that language may be in for a tweak.
 
 Powell has a delicate balancing act.
 Fed officials do not want to keep interest rates so high for so long that they squeeze the economy too much and tip it into a recession. On the other hand, they do not want to cut rates too much too early, allowing the economy to accelerate and risking a renewed pickup in inflation. Mr. Powell could talk about how officials will try to strike that balance.
 
 Growth vs. inflation will be critical.
 A lot of what comes next will hinge on which numbers Mr. Powell and his colleagues decide to focus on — growth or inflation — and investors might get a hint at that this week. Growth and consumer spending are both faster than many economists had expected. But the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is also below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021, even after stripping out food and fuel costs, which can fluctuate from month to month.
 
 Investors remain uncertain.
 The conflicting signals have made Wall Street less certain about what the Fed will do next. Most investors previously expected a rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in March. But sentiment is now tipping toward a rate cut in May. Mr. Powell’s remarks will have the potential to change those expectations — either making an imminent rate cut more likely, or walking it further off the table.
 
 “It’s a conversation about: When do they start to ease interest rates? Because they don’t want to over-tighten,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, chief U.S. rates strategist at T.D. Securities.
 
 “We’re heading into the last non-live meeting,” he said, meaning that while no rate move is expected in January, rate cuts could be on the table at any meeting thereafter.
 
 The pace of rate cuts is an open question.
 Another point of interest to watch out for on Wednesday: When the Fed does start to cut rates, what is that likely to look like? Rate cuts could come quickly and steadily, be large or small, and arrive earlier or later in the year.
 
 Christopher Waller, a governor at the Fed, has already suggested that the central bank should be able to move rates down “methodically and carefully,” rather than in the big rate declines that have at times happened in the past.
 
 Balance sheet details could be coming.
 The Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet of bond holdings, after it grew sharply during the pandemic as the central bank purchased securities to help soothe markets and stimulate the economy.
 
 Officials have been downsizing their holdings by allowing their securities to expire without reinvesting them. But policymakers will need to stop doing that at some point, because paring down bond holdings too much could cause chaos in markets.
 
 In fact, minutes from the Fed’s December meeting showed that officials thought “it would be appropriate for the Committee to begin to discuss the technical factors that would guide a decision to slow the pace of runoff well before such a decision was reached in order to provide appropriate advance notice to the public.”
 
 Will that discussion of the nerdy details come at that meeting? Economists will be on the lookout
 
 
 
 US Fed meet begins today: What to expect from the central bank?
 The US Federal Reserve is expected to maintain unchanged rates at its two-day policy meeting, but experts anticipate signals regarding future rate reductions.
 
 The two-day policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve is to begin on Tuesday, January 30, with the outcome due on Wednesday, January 31.
 
 While it is anticipated that the Fed will maintain unchanged rates this time, there are high expectations that the US central bank will provide signals regarding its intentions to commence rate reductions.

 The majority of experts now anticipate the US Federal Reserve to initiate rate cuts starting in May or June. This expectation takes into account the resilient US job market and inflation, which continues to surpass the Fed's 2 per cent target.
 
 ""On one hand, inflation numbers continue to surprise to the downside. The Fed’s preferred gauge decelerated to 2.9 per cent in December, crossing below 3 per cent for the first time since early 2021, according to data published Friday. On the other, consumer spending continues to be surprisingly robust. It’s undoubtedly getting a boost from the downdraft in inflation, but the strength still may keep some worried that price pressures could mount once again,"" reported Bloomberg.
 
 What to expect from the Fed's January meet?
 While a status quo on interest rates is widely expected, experts say the focus will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's commentary on the inflation trajectory.
 
 Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities is of the view that investors will watch the language of the Fed in the policy statement after the end of the central bank's first Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of 2024, and in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference.
 
 Jasani underscored that the recent statements from officials have suggested that the rate cuts will be carefully calibrated and not rushed.
 
 ""Taking cues from recent economic data, we feel the first rate cut by the US Fed will come in May/June, with the total quantum of rate cuts pegged at 75-100 bps in 2024,"" said Jasani.
 
 Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research and SAMCO Securities said it is almost certain that interest rates are going to remain unchanged in this meeting. However, the probability of rate cuts in March has also dropped below 50 per cent.
 
 This indicates that the market anticipates rate cuts to commence only in the May meeting, with a current probability of 91 per cent.
 
 ""We believe that rate cuts are likely to happen only in the second half of 2024. Investors will want to focus on the Fed’s stance on rate cuts and the commentary thereof given that the GDP growth for the Dec-23 quarter was much stronger at 3.3 per cent instead of an estimate of 2 per cent,"" said Sheth.
 
 The market has discounted a status quo on rates this time so the Fed outcome on January 31 may not influence the market mood significantly.
 
 Gaurang Shah, Senior Vice President at Geojit Financial Services does not expect the market to react significantly to the Fed meet outcome this time.
 
 ""Depending upon the statements, the market should have a major reaction but like always in the past, I don't think it's going to have any meaningful impact on the markets. A major reaction could be possible depending upon which way the comment is,"" said Shah.
 
 Shah said investors should focus more on fundamentals as it is difficult to predict when the Fed will start cutting rates.
 
 ""I think we will have to wait for the statements and outcomes of the future meets. It is difficult to preempt as to when they will start cutting the rates but I think we should concentrate more on our domestic data points,"" Shah said.
 
 ""With inflation showing signs of slowing down and the economy remaining relatively strong, we believe the Fed will keep the fed funds rate unchanged,"" said Vaibhav Shah, Fund Manager, Torus ORO PMS.
 
 ""Since the Fed pivot signal in early December, rates have firmed up on account of strong incoming data and hawkish comments from Fed Governors which have led to the realignment of expectation on rate cuts. It would be important to see whether the Fed maintains its dovish stance or surprises the market with a hawkish tone,"" said the fund manager of Torus ORO PMS.
