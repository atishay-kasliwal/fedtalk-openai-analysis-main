2023-02-01 19:30:00,2023-02-01 19:35:00," Good afternoon and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. Over the past year we've taken forceful actions to tighten the stance of monetary policy. We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so we have more work to do. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all. Today the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. In addition we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Storing price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 1%. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Under-spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace in part reflecting tighter financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing the labor market continues to be out of balance. Their demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers and the labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%. Over the 12 months ending in December total PCE prices rose 5.0%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 4.4%. The inflation data received over the past three months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And while recent developments are encouraging we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Despite elevated inflation, longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. As reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that's not grounds for complacency. Although inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to a returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal front's rate by 25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4.5 to 4.3 quarters percent. And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. With today's action, we have raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal front's rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that",-0.0028911732727093,0,2023-02-01,True,True,False,False,"Inflation has eased

 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak with the press following the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is expected to result in a quarter-point rate increase, the smallest hike in almost a year..Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index trended slightly downward to 6.5 percent in December 2022, although it remains considerably higher than pre-pandemic figures, and far short of the Fed’s goal of two percent..Fed policymakers are aiming for a soft landing — slowing the economy enough to contain inflation without causing much economic pain..COMMENTS:

 ""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back..ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".The Fed is widely seen as raising its target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in its first policy meeting of the year, after the rapid increases in 2022 to tame decades-high inflation..The latest figures put additional pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has been trying to slow the labor market with interest-rate hikes..The Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s..Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working..“The persistent lack of inventory, exacerbated by this ‘rate lock,’ is the main reason why we should expect prices to be stable or even rise in the year ahead.”
 
 
 Michael Burry tweeted out a piece of investing advice consisting of just one word, a day before the Federal Reserve's market-moving interest rate decision..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning..That might sound like bad news, but it means that the Fed’s mission to cool the economy and stall price increases is working..In December, Powell outlined how he hopes to win his ongoing fight against inflation: Limit economic growth and rebalance the labor market, which he said would allow inflation to return to a growth rate of about 2%..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..The Fed wants to cool hiring and wage increases, which can drive up inflationary pressures..That is close to being consistent with at-target inflation if repeated next quarter.”
 The ECI reading came as another report showed a slowdown in the US housing market as well as a dip in consumer confidence, suggesting the Fed’s tightening campaign is beginning to kick in..ADVERTISEMENT
 Some economists think the Fed doesn’t need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since prices began soaring last year, the Fed has opted to swing, aggressively raising interest rates despite the fact that there’s nothing close to a guarantee that doing so would be best for the economy..The Fed is hoping its interest rate hikes will create more unemployment, which would further ease inflation by reducing people’s spending..But by ignoring its goal of achieving full employment, the Fed is making lower-wage workers carry the burden of taming inflation by putting them out of work or erasing the significant wage gains they’ve made in the past decade, some of which had actually kept up with inflation before the Fed’s intervention..The Federal Reserve increased its policy rate to a 4.5% to 4.75% range, which followed six larger rate hikes in a row as the Fed continued its work to tame the worst stretch of inflation in 40 years..And the Fed signaled that even though inflation is easing, it remains high enough to require further rate hikes..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..In a statement, Fed officials repeated language they’ve used before, that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” That is widely interpreted to mean they will raise their benchmark rate again when they next meet in March and perhaps in May as well..His speech hammered home the Fed’s intent to keep raising rates — even if it caused “pain” in the form of slower growth and higher unemployment..“I still think there is a path to getting inflation down to 2%,” the Fed’s target level, “without a significant economic decline or significant increase in unemployment,” he said..The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal..The Fed’s hike was announced a day after the government said pay and benefits for America’s workers grew more slowly in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown..If all goes as planned, this will mark the eighth consecutive rate hike since March last year, which falls in line with what the Fed warned in December:

2023-02-01 19:35:00,2023-02-01 19:40:00," to 2% over time. We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most intracensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. People take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, the committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step down from last year's rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, as we determine the extent of future increases that we required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country, everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Chris. Good game. Chris Rugeber to associate at press. Thank you for doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which is also brought down mortgage rates in the stock market posted a solid game in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder and could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in or to offset the easing of financial conditions? It is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy or strength that we are putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2%. And of course financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we are not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course many things affect financial conditions, not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we said policy. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter we have seen a deceleration in prices, in wages and a fall in consumer spending. All while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low. Does this at all change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up if at all to see inflation come down to the levels you are looking for? So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see underway is really at an early stage. What you see is really in the good sector, you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services and shortages or have been abated. So you see that in the other, in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down assuming that new leases continue to be lower. So in those two sectors you have got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called non-housing, core non-housing services where we don't see disinflation yet. But I would say that so far what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go change since December? We are going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting and we will see at that time. I will stick to that.",0.0088978114853644,1,2023-02-01,True,True,True,True,"Inflation has eased

 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..As of December, policy-makers’ median forecast was for the Fed’s target interest rate to peak in a range between 5.00 per cent and 5.25 per cent, an outlook that would imply a pause in the policy tightening after two more quarter-percentage-point increases..Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has “a ways to go,” or will Fed officials signal that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..At that point, they’re expected to hold rates steady while they assess the impact on inflation..The Fed wants to cool hiring and wage increases, which can drive up inflationary pressures..Yet Fed officials have said they would need to see further evidence that inflation was declining closer to its 2% target before they would consider suspending their rate hikes..Some economists think the Fed doesn't need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since March, the statement has said that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” Some economists expect officials to slightly alter that part of the statement to make it a less specific commitment and give the Fed more flexibility..ADVERTISEMENT
 Some economists think the Fed doesn’t need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since prices began soaring last year, the Fed has opted to swing, aggressively raising interest rates despite the fact that there’s nothing close to a guarantee that doing so would be best for the economy..The Fed is hoping its interest rate hikes will create more unemployment, which would further ease inflation by reducing people’s spending..The Federal Reserve increased its policy rate to a 4.5% to 4.75% range, which followed six larger rate hikes in a row as the Fed continued its work to tame the worst stretch of inflation in 40 years..And the Fed signaled that even though inflation is easing, it remains high enough to require further rate hikes..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..In a statement, Fed officials repeated language they’ve used before, that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” That is widely interpreted to mean they will raise their benchmark rate again when they next meet in March and perhaps in May as well..The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal..The Fed’s hike was announced a day after the government said pay and benefits for America’s workers grew more slowly in the final three months of 2022, the third straight slowdown..If all goes as planned, this will mark the eighth consecutive rate hike since March last year, which falls in line with what the Fed warned in December:
 ""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."".More rate hikes are coming: ""Powell might acknowledge that the economy is slowing down and inflation is easing, but he's also going to signal the Fed's job is not over.""","Inflation has eased

2. The second text includes terms like ""decades-high inflation"" and ""tightrope,"" which highlight the urgency and precariousness of the current economic situation.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias through phrases that indicate proactive measures and acknowledgment of effects from policy actions, such as ""We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand"" and ""Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the committee to assess the economy's progress."" These phrases suggest optimism about the policies being effective and the potential for achieving goals like inflation reduction. In contrast, the second text takes a more cautious tone, hinting at lingering challenges with remarks like ""the economy is showing signs of stabilizing"" and the acknowledgment of ""a shaky tightrope between lowering inflation"" and potential economic recession. This indicates a more careful and less optimistic view of the economic situation.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text displays a higher level of certainty with assertive phrases like ""we will stay the course until the job is done"" and ""the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,"" indicating strong confidence in the steps being taken by the committee. In contrast, the second text shows moderate certainty with phrases such as ""some economists think the Fed doesn't need to push rates much higher"" and ""there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target,"" which suggest a level of uncertainty and speculation about future actions. This difference in language demonstrates that the first text expresses more definitive assurance regarding policy effectiveness."

So we'll update those forecasts in March. Neil. Hi Chair Powell, Neil or one of the axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December Jolt's morning job openings actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? So you're right about the data of course. We did see, we've seen our jar early earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number in Jolt's has been quite volatile recently and I did see that it moved up back up this morning. I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio I guess is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, nonetheless you're right. We do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market you still see very high payroll job creation and quits are still at an elevated level. So by many, many indicators the job market is still very strong. Colby and then how is it? Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the economic data since the December meeting is the trajectory for the Fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guide post for the policy path forward or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now. So you're right at the December meeting we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be and that's obviously back in December and the median for that was between five and five and a quarter percent. At the March meeting we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe on going rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to two percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground and financial additions of certainly tightened. I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we're writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to move rates up beyond what we said in December we would certainly do that. At the same time if the data come in in the other direction then we'll make data dependent decisions at coming meetings of course. Just as a quick follow up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in six or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back and we have to go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage. Whereas we have no incentive in the desire to over tighten. But if we feel like we've gone too far we can certainly, because the concern and inflation is coming down faster than we expect then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that in this situation where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years the job is not fully done. As I mentioned, I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that is 56% of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it. It's not happening yet. Inflation in the core services X housing is still running at 4% on a 6 and 12 month basis. So there's nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing less than 50%, you actually I think now have a story that is credible that's coming together. Although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline. So for the third sector we don't see anything here. So I think it would be premature. We very premature to declare victory or to the end of the year.",0.0038613083102017,2,2023-02-01,True,True,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

1. The first text provides a more detailed conversation on job openings as indicators and the variances in wage inflation, showcasing a real-time analysis, while the second text summarizes monetary policy decisions without delving into specific labor market intricacies.
2. The second text offers specific percentages and formal decisions regarding interest rates and policy actions, while the first text discusses potential future outcomes without firm decisions.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""disinflationary"" and ""employment cost index,"" which focus on detailed economic indicators, while the second text employs broader terms like ""monetary policy stance"" and ""cumulative tightening.""
2. The second text prominently features terms related to the Federal Reserve's operational protocols like ""federal funds rate"" and ""interest rate paid on reserve balances,"" which are absent in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text reflects a slightly more positive emotional bias, as it expresses gratification about ongoing economic trends. Phrases such as ""it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting underway"" and ""the job market is still very strong"" indicate an optimistic outlook on the labor market and inflation trends. In contrast, the second text adopts a more neutral tone, highlighting that inflation ""remains elevated"" despite easing somewhat. While it mentions ""robust job gains,"" it lacks the explicit sense of satisfaction or positivity found in the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits lower certainty compared to the second text. This is illustrated in phrases like ""I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be"" and ""it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little,"" showing hesitation and an acknowledgment of uncertainty. The second text, however, presents a more confident tone with statements like ""the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,"" which reinforces a strong sense of assurance regarding future monetary policy. The presence of clear anticipatory language in the second text contributes to its higher certainty level.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: disinflationary process, job openings number in Jolt's, employment cost index, financial additions, risk of doing too little
2. Second Text: easing inflation, quarter point increase, employment costs improve, significant progress, wage inflation continue to ameliorate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's efforts to manage inflation and interest rate adjustments.
2. They both highlight the current state of the labor market and its implications for wage growth.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the complexities and potential risks of the monetary policy decisions, emphasizing the cautious approach to tightening rates.
2. The second text portrays a more optimistic view regarding the easing of inflation and the Fed's potential to slow down rate hikes, conveying confidence in recent economic indicators.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a detailed analysis of specific metrics such as job openings and labor market conditions with a focus on intricacies around inflation affects and wage trends.
2. The second text offers a broader overview of the Fed's anticipated actions and sentiments regarding ongoing economic conditions and focuses less on specific data points.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""ongoing rate hikes"" and ""disinflation"" frequently, emphasizing the process and mechanics of policy adjustments.
2. The second text employs phrases like ""quarter point increase"" and ""significant progress,"" illustrating a focus on the tangible actions and achievements of the Fed in managing inflation.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more negative emotional bias, focusing on uncertainty and potential risks associated with inflation and the labor market. Phrases like ""I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be"" and ""it would be premature to declare victory"" emphasize caution and concern about the current economic situation. In contrast, the second text adopts a more optimistic tone, indicating that inflation is ""showing signs of weakening"" and that the ""Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation."" Thus, while both texts maintain a professional tone, the first text leans towards a more skeptical perspective, noting risks, while the second presents a relatively more positive outlook.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty through expressions of doubt and ambiguity. For instance, phrases such as ""I think we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data"" and ""I do think that it's probably an important indicator"" reflect uncertainty in the analysis of job openings and inflation outcomes. In contrast, the second text presents higher certainty by stating that ""inflation is easing"" and using phrases like ""experts expect the Fed to remove from its policy statement"" which indicates a stronger confidence in predictions regarding economic policy. Overall, the first text's language reflects hesitance and acknowledges several possible outcomes, while the second text presents a more assertive interpretation of the economic conditions and the Fed’s trajectory."
2023-02-01 19:45:00,2023-02-01 19:50:00," to think that we've really got this. We need to see our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector. And they should be coming into play to have inflation, the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But so far, we don't see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do. How are you? Hi, Howard, I'm Robert Throydres, and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation disease. Has these? That's new. You've taken out references to the war in Ukraine as causing prices increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher. Yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come. So I'm wondering why is that the case? And does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook? Or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact? So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it really in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. This is what we thought would happen to the very beginning. And now here it is actually happening. And for the reasons we thought, it's supply change, it's shortages, and it's demand revolving back towards services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's around a quarter of the PCE price index, core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services. And that's driven by very different things. And as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters, expect, measured inflation will continue moving up for several months. But we'll then come down assuming that new leases continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that's sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector. And we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down, this is good. We expect to see that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core services ex housing sector that I talked about. We don't see it yet. It's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same. And we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60% of that research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy. And so the labor market will probably be important. Some of the other ones that's, the labor market's not going to be important. Many other factors will drive it. In any case, we don't see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think we need to see that. It's the majority of the core PC index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is our mandate. So it's not that we're neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet. Until we do, I think we see ourselves, we've got to be honest with ourselves, we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent, we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to complete the job. I mean, that's what we're here for. Nick Timmeros, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above target inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? So we've raised rates four and a half percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think because inflation is still running very hot, we're of course taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that. And really, the story we're telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I've just gone through a couple of times. And again, we don't see it affecting the services sector X housing yet. But I mean, I think our assessment is that we're not very far from that level. We don't know that, though. We don't know that.",0.0011745130664579,3,2023-02-01,True,False,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..""One thing that struck me about the statement is that they had a very slightly dovish change in the language where they previously had talked about determining the pace of future increases and now they are talking about determining the extent of future increases..""Investors should be happy that we likely have a Fed that is going to end hikes fairly soon as the inflation data continues to show major improvements, which is exactly what the Fed needs to take their foot off the pedal."".How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".This particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services..Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation..Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on February 1, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.65 percent, effective February 2, 2023..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to
 4.75 percent, effective February 2, 2023.","""It's going to come down to the narrow line between avoiding a recession and entering a recession..Advertisement
 Inflation has slowed and the stock market has looked resilient for several months, with many economists crediting the Fed's recent actions as several key economic indicators show inflation easing after peaking last October..Financial experts said the latest economic data might lead the Fed to acknowledge that inflation was finally slowing and the economy is showing signs of stabilizing, but Powell was also known to be predictably measured in his words to head off volatility on Wall Street..Consumer-level inflation is cooling off from the double-digit levels that gripped the U.S. economy during summer 2022, but prices, particularly at the grocery store, remain stubbornly high, with eggs in particular experiencing an exponential gain in prices at the retail level..Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index trended slightly downward to 6.5 percent in December 2022, although it remains considerably higher than pre-pandemic figures, and far short of the Fed’s goal of two percent..""It's a good thing for the Fed that inflation pressures are cooling because the labor market isn't cooling at all."".COMMENTS:
 MICHELE RANERI, VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF U.S. RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, TRANSUNION, CHICAGO
 ""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back..ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..""One thing that struck me about the statement is that they had a very slightly dovish change in the language where they previously had talked about determining the pace of future increases and now they are talking about determining the extent of future increases..""Investors should be happy that we likely have a Fed that is going to end hikes fairly soon as the inflation data continues to show major improvements, which is exactly what the Fed needs to take their foot off the pedal."".How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".The post-meeting statement noted that inflation ""has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" a tweak on previous language..The document included language noting that the FOMC still sees the need for ""ongoing increases in the target range."".This particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services..Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation..Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”
 Ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting this week, the International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for a global economy that its officials said had proved “surprisingly resilient” in the face of monetary policy tightening and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine..It would be almost reckless for him to have the market believe that they're just about finished and inflation is where they want it..Inflation is certainly not where they want it."".""We see incredibly limited scope for the Fed to plausibly justify keeping this cycle going deeper into the year with what will already be a very restrictive policy stance in the face of what are likely mounting economic challenges to the backdrop."".That might sound like bad news, but it means that the Fed’s mission to cool the economy and stall price increases is working..In December, Powell outlined how he hopes to win his ongoing fight against inflation: Limit economic growth and rebalance the labor market, which he said would allow inflation to return to a growth rate of about 2%..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..Policymakers are unlikely to declare victory in their inflation fight just yet..It has acknowledged that “there’s going to be a bit of pain to achieve the inflation target,” seeing job losses as the “lesser of two evils,” Rossiter said..By contrast, central bankers in Europe have said they have more work to do to tamp down rising prices..WASHINGTON — Inflation is cooling, and parts of the economy appear to be weakening..After being caught off guard — Powell had initially characterized high inflation as only a temporary phenomenon — officials developed a clear view of what was needed: An aggressive series of rate hikes to slow borrowing and spending, cool growth and curb high inflation..Since March, the statement has said that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” Some economists expect officials to slightly alter that part of the statement to make it a less specific commitment and give the Fed more flexibility..Since prices began soaring last year, the Fed has opted to swing, aggressively raising interest rates despite the fact that there’s nothing close to a guarantee that doing so would be best for the economy..He’s out there swinging to show markets that he won’t stand still while prices continue to rise, even though his tools to fight inflation have been especially blunt this cycle — incapable of addressing major inflationary pressures like energy costs or supply-chain bottlenecks..But by ignoring its goal of achieving full employment, the Fed is making lower-wage workers carry the burden of taming inflation by putting them out of work or erasing the significant wage gains they’ve made in the past decade, some of which had actually kept up with inflation before the Fed’s intervention..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..The Fed chair said that so far, much of the inflation slowdown reflects the prices of goods, notably gas but also furniture, appliances and other finished products that have benefited from an unraveling of supply chain snarls..His speech hammered home the Fed’s intent to keep raising rates — even if it caused “pain” in the form of slower growth and higher unemployment..“I still think there is a path to getting inflation down to 2%,” the Fed’s target level, “without a significant economic decline or significant increase in unemployment,” he said..The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal..Inflation has reached 10.5% in the United Kingdom.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: disinflationary process, core services ex housing, supply change, inflation disease, ongoing increases, persistent inflation

1. Both texts focus on the issue of inflation and its impact on the economy.
2. They both discuss the role of monetary policy in addressing inflation and achieving economic stability.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the complexity of inflation dynamics and acknowledges uncertainty in certain sectors, while the second text presents a more structured and directive tone regarding monetary policy decisions.
2. The first text elaborates on sector-specific inflation trends (goods and services), while the second text maintains a broader overview of economic conditions and objectives.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides an in-depth analysis of the specific sectors of inflation, particularly focusing on the implications of the labor market and housing services, whereas the second text provides a concise summary of recent economic indicators and decisions.
2. The second text includes specific actions taken by the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, showing a concrete implementation of policy compared to the more speculative nature of the first text.

Specific Terminology Differences:

2. The second text includes references to ""Russia’s war against Ukraine"" affecting the economy, whereas the first text has removed direct references to the war and instead focuses on domestic issues related to inflation.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias through its use of optimistic language and the repetitive emphasis on progress regarding disinflation. Phrases like ""we can now say, I think, for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started"" and ""this is a good thing"" illustrate a sense of achievement and hopefulness about inflation trends. In contrast, the second text maintains a more neutral tone with phrases such as ""inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated,"" indicating a focus on the current state rather than progress, which lacks emotional elevation.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: moderate certainty
Explanation: The first text expresses a moderate level of certainty characterized by both confidence and a recognition of uncertainties, as seen in phrases like ""I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet."" This indicates that while there is some optimism about future outcomes, there is also acknowledgment of the present challenges. In contrast, the second text demonstrates higher certainty regarding the Federal Reserve's actions and outlook, particularly with statements like ""The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks"" and ""The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective."" The language used in the second text suggests a clear and resolute stance, contributing to a more definitive tone.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

2. Second Text: avoiding a recession, Consumer Price Index, wage inflation, excessive economic challenges

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the phenomenon of inflation and the factors influencing it, including the recent trends and projections related to economic conditions.
2. Both mention the role of the Federal Reserve (Fed) in managing inflation and the implications of its policies on the economy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes a cautious approach to inflation management, reflecting uncertainty about the timeline for achieving desired inflation levels.
2. The second text reflects a more optimistic tone regarding inflation trends, indicating that some progress has been made and suggesting that the Fed’s actions are yielding results.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a detailed analysis of specific sectors influencing inflation, such as goods prices and housing services, while the second text offers a broader overview of inflation trends and their implications for the labor market and consumer prices.
2. The first text delves deeper into the potential future dynamics of inflation within specific categories, while the second text focuses more on recent economic data and trends.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text frequently uses terms like ""core PCE price index"" and ""disinflationary process,"" which relate to specific economic indicators and processes, while the second text highlights aspects like ""Consumer Price Index"" and ""wage inflation,"" which focus on consumer impacts and labor economics.
2. The first text refers to ""ongoing increases"" in rates pertaining to future monetary policy, whereas the second text discusses the ""narrow line between avoiding a recession and entering a recession,” portraying a more urgent economic context.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text displays a subtle positive emotional bias, particularly in sections that emphasize ""We can now say, I think, for the first time, that the disinflationary process has started"" and ""This is a good thing."" These phrases reflect a sense of optimism regarding the progress made in reducing inflation. The second text, while acknowledging that inflation is ""cooling,"" maintains a more cautious tone and emphasizes remaining challenges, such as persistent high prices and the potential threat of recession. Phrases like ""the narrow line between avoiding a recession and entering one"" and ""there’s going to be a bit of pain to achieve the inflation target"" indicate a level of concern and uncertainty, contributing to a slightly more negative emotional bias than the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a higher level of certainty, particularly in its expressions of confidence about understanding the inflationary process. For example, it states, ""We expect to see that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon,"" which reflects a strong sense of expectation. In contrast, the second text reveals a moderate level of certainty with phrases such as ""it remains elevated"" and ""the Fed's mission to cool the economy... seems to be working,"" which acknowledges some progress but still communicates lingering doubts about achieving the desired inflation targets. The sentiments surrounding ""we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path"" further highlight a more tentative approach compared to the first text."
2023-02-01 20:00:00,2023-02-01 20:05:00," going forward in 2023 and the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I'm wondering if you have changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward. And whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place which calls for more restraint on your part. So I do think you most forecast and my own assessment would be that growth will continue, positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of GDP growth of 1% last year and also final sales growth which we think is a better indicator of about 1%. I think most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors though that need to be considered. You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit and that will matter for us potentially. The global market remains very, very strong and that's job creation, that's wages as inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also state and local governments are really flush these days with money and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support, they're also spending a lot, there's a lot of spending coming in a construction pipeline both private and public and so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year and that's my base case is that there will be positive growth this year. Rich? Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg, first of all how are you doing? Fine, thanks. Good. Second of all, I think it's early on in the post conference you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you think? You mentioned three months, we've seen three months in a row of governor Walder suggested he might want to see six months. Is it just the inflation data or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that substantially more evidence? So I don't think there's a, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating accumulation of evidence. So of course we'll be looking by the time of the March meeting we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will and we'll be asking ourselves what are they telling us and soon after that we'll have another ECI wage report which as you know is a report that we we like because it is just for composition and it's very complete. And you know the one we got I guess it was yesterday was was constructive it's you know it shows wages coming down but still at a high level there's still at a level that's way above where well above where they were before the before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months but as the accumulated evidence comes in it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say though we you know it is our job to restore price stability and achieve two percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. Market participants have a very different job and it's a fine job it's a great job I'm Victor I did that job for for years but in one form or another but you know we have to deliver that and so we are strongly resolved that we will you know complete this task because we think it has benefits that will you know support economic activity and benefit the public for for many many years. Thank you so thank you for taking the questions so you've talked about we had solid job growth I'm ever Lawrence from Fox Business by the way we had solid job growth slight falling in the increase in consumer spending it seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to from a 9.1% CPI inflation to 6.5% CPI inflation is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2. I don't think we know honestly you know the so we of course expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021 and it didn't it didn't come down all through 22 and now it's coming down it's coming down pretty fast so I would say these are this is not a standard business cycle you can look at the last.",0.002639425191847,4,2023-02-01,True,True,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

So I think certainty is just not appropriate here inflation. It's just harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster It may take longer to come down and you know our job is to deliver inflation back to Target and we will do that but I think we we're gonna be cautious about About declaring victory and you know sending signals that That we think that the game is won because it you know it's we've got a long way to go It's just it's the early stages of disinflation and it's most welcome to be able to say that that we are now in disinflation but That's great, but we we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it's gonna take some time That's all do you how long do you see then the federal fund rate remaining at this elevated level? You know so again my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SCP and I mean there are many different forecasts But generally it's a forecast of slower growth Some softening in labor market conditions and inflation moving down Moving down steadily but not quickly and in that case If if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations it will not be appropriate to to cut rates this year To loosen policy this year of course other people have forecast with with inflation coming down much faster That's a different thing you know if that happens inflation comes down much faster You know then we'll be seeing that and and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy Thank you chair Powell Simon to win a bitch with the economist I may ask a further question about the language around ongoing Increases that of course implies at least two further rate rises If you look at Fed fund features pricing the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause are you concerned about that divergence? Or do you think if everything breaks right is that is out of plausible outcome? I'm not I'm not particularly concerned about about the divergence note because it's it is largely due to the markets expectation that inflation will move down more quickly I think that's that's the the bigger part of that So again as I just mentioned we you know our forecast their different participants have different forecasts But generally those forecasts over for continued subdued growth Some softening the labor market but not a recession not a recession and and we have inflation moving down You know into these somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year will update that in March But that's what we thought in December markets are past that they they show inflation coming down in some cases Much quicker than that so we'll just have to see and we have a different view and a different view to different forecast really and Given our outlook I just I don't see us cutting rates this year if we get our have our outlook turns true as I mentioned just now if we do see inflation coming down much more quickly That'll that'll play into our policy saying of course I Share pal Scott horse they're for NPR One of the changes in the statement this this month is that the committee is no longer listing public health as a month Data points you'll consider in assessing conditions What should we make of that does the federal reserve no longer see the pandemic as as weighing on the economy? That's the general sense of it look we understand I personally understand well that that COVID is still out there but That it's no longer playing an important role in our economy and you know We kept that statement in there for For quite a while and I think we just we knew we would take it out at some point. There's never a perfect time But we thought that you know people are handling it better in the economy in the society or handling it better now It doesn't really need to be in a you know in the feds Monthly or you know post meeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to you know a health issue Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Gensers with Marketplace Wanted to go back to another thing that fed by share labry nerds had recently She said she doesn't see signs of a wage price Spy roll and I'm wondering if you agree with that I do yeah, I do and I don't see that yet But the whole point is you know if you once you see it You're you have a serious problem that that that means that effectively in people's decision-making inflation has become a really salient issue and once that happens That's which that's what we can't allow to happen and You know so that's why we worry that the longer we're at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long every day You know that the more",0.0035104567835031,5,2023-02-01,True,True,False,False,"Inflation has eased

 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.65 percent, effective February 2, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and

 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak with the press following the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is expected to result in a quarter-point rate increase, the smallest hike in almost a year..COMMENTS:
 MICHELE RANERI, VICE PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF U.S. RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, TRANSUNION, CHICAGO
 ""This second consecutive lower hike serves as evidence that the Federal Reserve is signaling that significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation and that we have reached a point where rate hikes can be further scaled back..ELLEN HAZEN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, F.L.PUTNAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS
 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".So will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has a way to go, or will the Fed show signs that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.But now they're wondering when the Fed will stop as it walks a shaky tightrope between lowering inflation to its 2% target and pushing the economy into recession..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”
 Ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting this week, the International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for a global economy that its officials said had proved “surprisingly resilient” in the face of monetary policy tightening and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine..Some analysts do expect the Fed to remove from its policy statement the current, open-ended promise of “ongoing increases” in interest rates, a phrase used since the central bank began its tightening cycle in March..“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..Others say it’s premature to assume a rate hike pause is on the horizon..Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has “a ways to go,” or will Fed officials signal that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..At that point, they’re expected to hold rates steady while they assess the impact on inflation..Some economists think the Fed doesn't need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since March, the statement has said that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” Some economists expect officials to slightly alter that part of the statement to make it a less specific commitment and give the Fed more flexibility..ADVERTISEMENT
 Some economists think the Fed doesn’t need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..“I still think there is a path to getting inflation down to 2%,” the Fed’s target level, “without a significant economic decline or significant increase in unemployment,” he said..The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal..If all goes as planned, this will mark the eighth consecutive rate hike since March last year, which falls in line with what the Fed warned in December:
 ""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."".More rate hikes are coming: ""Powell might acknowledge that the economy is slowing down and inflation is easing, but he's also going to signal the Fed's job is not over.""","Inflation has eased

 ""The key thing the Fed is focused on is wages and we are seeing wage inflation continue to ameliorate if you look at both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index which just came out, wages are beginning to soften, but they are not softening enough to get inflation down to that 2% target..How close are we now with ending the rate hike cycle, when it’s clear employment costs are slowing?"".So will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has a way to go, or will the Fed show signs that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.Fed officials have repeatedly warned traders’ that those expectations are misguided and that more work needs to be done to fight inflation..Inflation rates have ebbed somewhat while consumer spending and hiring have slowed and wage increases have moderated — the central bank’s prescribed interest rate hikes, meant to cool the economy and stall price increases, seem to be working..But now they're wondering when the Fed will stop as it walks a shaky tightrope between lowering inflation to its 2% target and pushing the economy into recession..Policy-makers hope to avoid that sort of outcome this time, and economic data since their last policy meeting in December generally has moved in the right direction: Inflation is slowing under the impact of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions, while the economy continues to grow and create jobs..“Recent events suggest that the coming year may be a notch less challenging than previously thought,” Nathan Sheets, chief global economist at Citi, wrote this week, noting that recession risks were easing on a global basis while U.S. data “pointed to continued growth, moderating inflation, and a slower pace of Fed rate hikes.”
 Ahead of the Fed’s two-day meeting this week, the International Monetary Fund increased its outlook for a global economy that its officials said had proved “surprisingly resilient” in the face of monetary policy tightening and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine..Some analysts do expect the Fed to remove from its policy statement the current, open-ended promise of “ongoing increases” in interest rates, a phrase used since the central bank began its tightening cycle in March..“While we expect the Fed to downshift the pace of tightening to 25bp increments … we also anticipate a hawkish resolve … policy-makers are encouraged by recent developments, but appear to remain united in the need to ‘keep at it’ with respect to reducing inflation pressures.”
 The Fed’s meeting this week, its first of 2023, will not include new economic forecasts from policy-makers, the most explicit way for them to signal where rates may be headed this year..As of December, policy-makers’ median forecast was for the Fed’s target interest rate to peak in a range between 5.00 per cent and 5.25 per cent, an outlook that would imply a pause in the policy tightening after two more quarter-percentage-point increases..Others say it’s premature to assume a rate hike pause is on the horizon..Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell dampen expectations and reiterate that the fight against inflation still has “a ways to go,” or will Fed officials signal that they’re ready to ease up on rate hikes?.Since the last Fed meeting in December, two economic trends have made the case for slowing rate hikes: Recent data on wage growth and inflation have been encouraging and economic growth signals have become concerning..Fed officials have said that while they believe they’re on the correct path, they still think there’s a long way to go until they reach their 2% inflation target..“Passing peak inflation is welcome and policymakers appear to have increased confidence that inflation is on a path lower, but the Fed is not yet convinced that inflationary pressures will dissipate quickly,” wrote Bank of America economists in a recent note..At that point, they’re expected to hold rates steady while they assess the impact on inflation..Some economists think the Fed doesn't need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since March, the statement has said that “ongoing increases in the (interest rate) target range will be appropriate.” Some economists expect officials to slightly alter that part of the statement to make it a less specific commitment and give the Fed more flexibility..ADVERTISEMENT
 Some economists think the Fed doesn’t need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..At the same time, Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference that the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has cooled — a signal that it could be nearing the end of its rate increases..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..“I still think there is a path to getting inflation down to 2%,” the Fed’s target level, “without a significant economic decline or significant increase in unemployment,” he said..The U.S. inflation slowdown suggests that the Fed’s rate hikes have started to achieve their goal..If all goes as planned, this will mark the eighth consecutive rate hike since March last year, which falls in line with what the Fed warned in December:
 ""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."".More rate hikes are coming: ""Powell might acknowledge that the economy is slowing down and inflation is easing, but he's also going to signal the Fed's job is not over.""","For release at 2:00 p.m. EST February 1, 2023

1. First Text: global pandemic, disinflation, labor market conditions, wage price spiral
2. Second Text: target range, maximum employment, monetary policy, federal funds rate, cumulative tightening, inflation expectations

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of inflation and its effects on the economy.
2. Both texts refer to the actions and commitments of the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates and monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes real-time concerns regarding inflation trends and economic uncertainties stemming from the pandemic, while the second text focuses on planned monetary policy actions and targets.
2. The first text includes a more conversational and speculative tone, whereas the second text is formal and presents a structured outline of decisions made by the Federal Reserve.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text discusses specific challenges such as forecasting inflation and the Fed's cautious approach, while the second text provides precise metrics related to interest rate targets and policy frameworks without delving into speculative outcomes.
2. The first text presents anecdotal observations about ongoing economic conditions, while the second text reiterates predefined goals and past decisions.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text refers to terms like ""disinflation"" and ""wage price spiral,"" which highlight concerns about inflation's impact on decision-making, while the second text emphasizes ""cumulative tightening"" and ""federal funds rate,"" focusing on quantitative monetary policy measures.
2. The second text uses formal terminology related to monetary policy and specific committee actions (e.g., ""Board of Governors,"" ""primary credit rate""), which are not present in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text expresses a sense of caution and uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, particularly about inflation and the recovery from the pandemic. Phrases such as ""I think certainty is just not appropriate"" and ""we're gonna be cautious about declaring victory"" illustrate a more pessimistic tone and a feeling of hesitance regarding future economic conditions. In contrast, the second text contains more positive language with phrases like ""Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production"" and ""the Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" which suggest a proactive approach to addressing economic concerns. This indicates that the first text carries a slightly more negative bias in comparison to the more positive and resolute tone of the second text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text reflects a lower level of certainty, showcased by phrases like ""It may come down faster; it may take longer to come down"" and ""various forecasts"" that highlight fluctuating expectations. The speaker also acknowledges the uncertainty of the market's perception: ""we have a different view and a different view to different forecast,"" which contributes to a notion of doubt in the ability to predict economic outcomes. In comparison, the second text conveys a more certain and assertive stance on policy decisions with phrases such as ""The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases... will be appropriate"" and ""the Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" both of which denote confidence in the anticipated actions and expected outcomes. Therefore, the first text expresses lower certainty compared to the higher certainty evident in the second text.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: disinflation, public health as a data point, wage price spiral, economic risk
2. Second Text: ongoing increases (in interest rates), elevated levels, quarter-point rate increase, hawkish resolve

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the implications for inflation.
2. Both highlight the uncertainty regarding future inflation trends and the economic outlook.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text places more emphasis on the cautious approach of the Federal Reserve and the complexity of forecasting, while the second text focuses on the Fed's evolving stance and market expectations.
2. The first text discusses the pandemic's effects on the economy, whereas the second text is more concerned with the potential for recession and the current state of the economy.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides more detailed commentary on the Fed Chair's viewpoint about current inflation and economic risks, while the second text includes broader industry perspectives and quotes from financial analysts.
2. The first text delves into the implications of public health on the economy, while the second text focuses on the specific metrics like wage growth and employment costs.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The term ""disinflation"" is specific to the first text, while ""ongoing increases"" is prominent in the second text.
2. The concept of ""wage price spiral"" appears in the first text but is absent from the second, which instead discusses ""wage inflation.""","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text conveys a tone of caution and uncertainty regarding inflation and the economic outlook, which could be interpreted as slightly more negative. Phrases such as ""it's just harder to forecast inflation,"" ""we're gonna be cautious about declaring victory,"" and ""we've got a long way to go"" highlight a sense of apprehension and advisory caution toward the current economic situation. In contrast, the second text contains phrases like ""significant progress has been made in tamping down inflation,"" ""inflation is slowing,"" and ""the economy continues to grow and create jobs,"" suggesting a more optimistic outlook. These differences underscore a subtle emotional bias in the first text leaning more toward skepticism about the economic recovery compared to the generally more positive sentiment expressed in the second text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a lower level of certainty, primarily through its use of tentative language and conditional phrases. Statements like ""it may come down faster; it may take longer to come down,"" and ""if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations"" indicate a degree of uncertainty about future economic conditions and Federal Reserve actions. Conversely, the second text exhibits higher certainty, with phrases such as ""the expected increase is the eighth in a series"" and ""the Fed recognizes that the pace of inflation has cooled,"" reflecting a more confident assessment of economic data and trends. This distinction suggests a notable contrast in how each text communicates certainty regarding the Fed's policy and the economic landscape."

By the way, I think it's becoming less salient and people are, you know, we pick that up in conversations and I've seen some data too that show people are, you know, gradually, they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now and they're very, very low with 3.5 percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases, is nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. So that's what you're looking at most closely is consumer expectations. That's at the very hardest. Consumers in businesses that, you know, are essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are very, at a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That's a, that's a, sort of a bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be, we think it's important. And in this case, I would say the risk eight months ago or so, longer term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are, they seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it's, you know, and that's, I think that's very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided and the public has decided that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it's just a matter of us following through. That's measurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that'll be part of the process of getting it down and it's a very positive thing. Great. Thank you, Chair Powell, Greg Robb from Marker Watch. In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of senses that struck people as important. When the committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I haven't seen, heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members or is that still something you're concerned about? Thank you. I would put it this way. It's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place. As we've discussed a couple of times here, there's a different difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down. We're just going to have to see. I mean, I'm not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast. But our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we'll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we'll see. Good to bring in for the last question. Hi Chair Powell. Brendan Peterson with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer faster to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play an effect as we get closer to that drop-dead deadline this summer? I look at it's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two because I believe Congress will wind up acting and as it will and must in the end to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk the progress we're making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. We of course will monitor money market conditions carefully as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down and then it will grow back up and we understand there'll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that and we're watching it carefully. We'll just be monitoring it. Thank you very much.",-0.0022833268558103,6,2023-02-01,True,False,False,False,"Inflation has eased

 Some economists think the Fed doesn’t need to push rates much higher — and that doing so would heighten the risk of a deep recession..Since prices began soaring last year, the Fed has opted to swing, aggressively raising interest rates despite the fact that there’s nothing close to a guarantee that doing so would be best for the economy..The Fed is hoping its interest rate hikes will create more unemployment, which would further ease inflation by reducing people’s spending..But by ignoring its goal of achieving full employment, the Fed is making lower-wage workers carry the burden of taming inflation by putting them out of work or erasing the significant wage gains they’ve made in the past decade, some of which had actually kept up with inflation before the Fed’s intervention..“We can now say I think for the first time,” he said, “that the disinflationary process has started.”
 Yet he also stressed that it was too soon to declare victory over the worst inflation bout in four decades: “We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a long, sustained downward path.”
 The Fed’s rate increase Wednesday, though smaller than its half-point hike in December and the four three-quarter-point hikes before that, will likely further raise the costs of many consumer and business loans and the risk of a recession..The risk is that with some sectors of the economy weakening, ever-higher borrowing costs could tip the economy into a downturn later this year..While higher pay is good for workers, businesses typically pass their increased labor costs on to their customers by charging higher prices, thereby perpetuating inflation pressures..The biggest risk to the market isn't a recession in 2023..In JPMorgan's view, the biggest risk is actually the possibility that there's no recession at all — this is why.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

2023-03-22 18:40:00,2023-03-22 18:45:00, the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and really before the recent events we were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes. In fact as of a couple of weeks ago it looked like we'd need to raise rates over the course of the year more than we'd expected at the time of the SEP in December. It's time to December meeting. We are committed to restoring price stability and all of the evidence says that the public has confidence that we will do so that we'll bring inflation down to 2% over time. It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words. So we also assess as I mentioned that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tight and credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby way on demand on the labor market and on inflation. Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening. In principle as a matter of fact you can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that. Of course it's not possible to make that assessment today with any precision whatsoever. So our decision was to move ahead with a 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance as I mentioned from ongoing hikes to some additional hikes maybe some policy-firming may be appropriate. So going forward as I mentioned in assessing the need for further hikes will be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and in particular on our assessment of the actual unexpected effects of credit tightening. Mr. Chairman can you explain the difference between ongoing rate increases and firming? Does firming imply a rate increase per se or could policy firm without you increasing rates? No I think it's meant to refer to our policy rate. Really I would focus on the words may and some as opposed to ongoing. So we clearly were what we were doing there was taking on board the on trying to reflect the uncertainty about what will happen. I mean it's possible that this will turn out to have very modest effects. These events will turn out to be very very modest effects on the economy in which case an inflation will continue to be strong in which case the you know the path will look might look different. It's also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant tightening in credit conditions over time and in principle if that that that means that monetary policy may have less work to do we simply don't know. So do you have any concerns at the recent that we're hiking did today could further exacerbate the problem in the banks? No I mean we're with our monetary policy were really focused on macroeconomic outcomes in particular were focused on on this potential credit tightening and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions. I think when we think about the situation in the banks we're focused on our financial stability tools in particular our lending facilities the debt sorry the discount window and also the new facility. Nick Timmeros the Wall Street Journal at Sherpowell in your testimony two weeks ago you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher obviously that was before the stress in the making sector and I realized there's a lot of uncertainty but can you can you explain it all to what extent your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the board staff incorporated today a material tightening and credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts. So you know we just come from an FOMC meeting and you know the people who write them in it will be very carefully counting but I'll tell you what I heard what I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated they would be some some tightening of credit conditions and that would really have the same effects as as our policies do and that therefore they were including that in their assessment and that if that did turn out not to be the case the in principle you'd need more rate hikes so some people did reflect that in their in their in their at from in their SCP forecast I think there may also just have been remember this is 12 days ago you know we're trying to assess something that just is so recent and it's people you know it's very difficult this so much uncertainty so December was a good place to start and we wound up with we wound up with very similar outcomes for December and it you know in a way the the early the data in the first part the first five weeks of the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market so that pointed to higher rates and then this this latter part kind of the positive,0.0040062096249186,7,2023-03-22,True,True,False,False,"The Committee

 Federal Reserve policymakers believe beating back inflation may require just one more interest-rate hike this year but less easing next year than most thought would be appropriate just three months ago..WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers believe beating back inflation may require just one more interest-rate hike this year but less easing next year than most thought would be appropriate just three months ago..As recently as two weeks ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was telling lawmakers that the central bank was willing to raise rates by as much as necessary to rein in inflation — words that investors interpreted as meaning a large 50-point hike was on the table..There’s no decisive indication in advance whether the Fed will continue its yearlong aggressive course of interest rate hikes, or instead hold off on an increase this time..In March, Powell indicated that interest rates could move higher and stay there for longer than previously expected, but current financial conditions could indicate less need to hold rates higher in order to cool the economy and bring down inflation..""Ideally, we would like the Fed to go with a 25 basis point hike this meeting, tone down hawkish guidance and emphasize that policy decisions at subsequent meetings will continue to be data-dependent,"" Wong said..""In our view, inflation is even more likely to remain sticky, the Fed is likely to be much tighter than consensus expects, and we now expect the upcoming downturn to be even more protracted."".In light of uncertainties, she said, “we are neither committed to raise further nor are we finished with hiking rates.”
 In the United States, most recent data still points to a solid economy and rampant hiring..Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”
 The speed at which the hikes have rippled through the financial system has picked up, reducing the number of buyers for the government bonds which banks hold because they can be readily sold..Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank believe that the “ECB’s decision last week offers a relevant blueprint for the Fed: Raise rates in line with expectations, drop forward guidance, but signal a continued tightening bias.”
 This move came amid calls for central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to dial back on policy tightening in light of the banking crisis..Dutta said in his note that he expected a 0.25% rate hike, adding, “I think it is premature to assume the inflation outlook has changed much because of what we’re seeing unfold in markets.”
 
 
 Federal Reserve officials have a difficult path ahead of them..""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."".“It presents a risk that there will be a much bigger move in markets after the announcement.”
 
 
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates slightly, but its path is uncertain as worries plague the banking system..The Fed also warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve extended its yearlong fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system..At the same time, the Fed warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 The central bank also signalled that it’s likely nearing the end of its aggressive series of rate hikes..The statement now says “some additional policy firming may be appropriate” — a weaker commitment to future hikes..It said that hiring is “running at a robust pace” and noted that “inflation remains elevated.” It removed the phrase, “inflation has eased somewhat,” which it had included in its statement in February..“Financial stability concerns have resurfaced but inflation still remains uncomfortably high and is showing signs that it won’t fall as far or as fast as hoped.”
 Some economists said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold, while David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crisis, urged the UK central bank to slash rates and stop selling government bonds to shore up the economy..Before the failure of SVB, a rate increase of 0.5 percentage points had been expected in financial markets, after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said more increases would be needed to cool inflation..The FOMC statement released on Wednesday also said ""some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time."".They note the Fed could still soften its forward guidance by dropping its reference to ""ongoing increases"", much as the European Central Bank did last week..The Fed was stuck with a difficult decision as it balanced whether to keep hiking rates to drive down inflation or ease off the increases given the pain it has already caused for the banking industry, which could drag down the rest of the economy..Advertisement

Additionally, the statement ""all of the evidence says that the public has confidence"" conveys conviction. Conversely, the second text reflects more uncertainty, as shown in phrases like ""there's no decisive indication"" and ""it presents a risk that there will be a much bigger move in markets,"" which suggests a lack of confidence in predicting future outcomes.

To follow up, have you considered all whether your primary tool, the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions that you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector? Have you, for example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the system open market account as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don't accelerate deposit erosion, for example, from banks? We know that we have other tools in effect, but no, we think our monetary policy tool works and we think many, many banks, our rate hikes were well telegraphed to the market and many banks have managed to handle them. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask you along with the FDIC and the Treasury, the Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks. I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made. Was it purely a confidence issue or was there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of these banks? The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the risk of contagion to other banks and to the financial markets more broadly. That was the issue. Okay, and then can you also just follow up? Can you speak to the role that you will be playing in the Fed's internal investigation on its supervision and regulation? So Vice Chair Barr is, of course, leading that review and he's responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for supervision. We, I realized, you know, right away that there was going to be a need for a review. I mean, the question we were all asking ourselves over that first weekend was how did this happen? And so what we did was early Monday morning we sat down and said, let's do this and he's obviously going to lead it in his capacity. So I don't, you know, my role was to announce it and I get briefed on it, but I'm not involved in the work of it. Howard? Chair Powell, Howard, Senator from Rooters. So I want to go back to your February press conference. You mentioned the word disinflation, I believe nine or ten times. The process that you felt was, I forget the word you used, but gratefully underway or something like that. Is disinflation still occurring in the US today? Yes, I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the question 12 times. So it's a, maybe it's a feature or not a bug, but so, but yeah, absolutely the, absolutely the same, the story is intact. So it's really three parts, right? Goods inflation's been coming down now for six months. It's proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it's certainly proceeding. Housing services is really a matter of time passing. We continue to see the new lease is being signed at much lower levels of inflation. So that's 44% of the core PCE index where you've got a story that's ongoing, where we didn't have in February and we still don't have now, is a sign of progress in the non-housing services sector. And that is, you know, that's just something that will have to come through, through softening demand and perhaps some softening in labor market conditions. We don't see that yet. And that's, that's of course 56% of the index. So the story is pretty much the same. I will say that the inflation data that we got to your point really pointed to stronger inflation. If I could follow up on that, I was curious why you don't see more coming from the credit crunch because it seems to me that's something that you'd actually welcome to a degree and expect. And are you not seeing more coming from that because you don't know or because you just don't want to have another round of wishful thinking? So it's really just a question of not knowing at this point. There's a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, hiring and inflation, very large body of literature. The question is how significant will this credit tightening be and how sustained will it be? That's the issue. And we don't really see it yet. It's so, so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing estimates and it's, but it's very kind of rule of thumb guesswork almost at this point. But we think it's, it's potentially quite real. And that argues for, you know, being alert as we go forward, as we think about for the rate hikes, for us, we'll be paying attention to the actual unexpected effects from that. Gina? Hi, Chair Powell. Gina Smiley from New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit. I know that you've got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're going to do.",0.0018205396777893,8,2023-03-22,True,False,False,False,"Recent developments are likely to result

 WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - A conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat in the U.S. Senate are introducing legislation on Wednesday to replace the Federal Reserve's internal watchdog with one appointed by the president, aiming to tighten bank supervision following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank..Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector..Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”
 The speed at which the hikes have rippled through the financial system has picked up, reducing the number of buyers for the government bonds which banks hold because they can be readily sold..Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, called that speculation “a ridiculous notion,” and said it would “send the completely the wrong message at a time when optics are everything.”

 WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - A conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat in the U.S. Senate are introducing legislation on Wednesday to replace the Federal Reserve's internal watchdog with one appointed by the president, aiming to tighten bank supervision following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank..Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector..Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”
 The speed at which the hikes have rippled through the financial system has picked up, reducing the number of buyers for the government bonds which banks hold because they can be readily sold..Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, called that speculation “a ridiculous notion,” and said it would “send the completely the wrong message at a time when optics are everything.”
 He added: If the Fed does have concerns about some parts of the US banking sector, why weren’t they apparent 3 weeks ago when they were pushing the case for keeping a 0.50% rate hike on the table?.But the Fed’s decision to raise rates by a quarter point on March 22, 2023, and modestly lift its projection for how much higher they will go in 2024 does little to ease the growing concerns about the health of regional banks..Meanwhile, investors were still bristling over the bank collapses but were also eager to hear how the Fed planned to get the situation under control while some feared another bump in interest rates would likely ensnare other banks..To stem the fallout, federal regulators have taken several steps to guarantee deposits and shore up other small banks..Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank believe that the “ECB’s decision last week offers a relevant blueprint for the Fed: Raise rates in line with expectations, drop forward guidance, but signal a continued tightening bias.”
 This move came amid calls for central banks on both sides of the Atlantic to dial back on policy tightening in light of the banking crisis..“The fall of both SVB and Signature, the near-crash of First Republic, and the struggles of other regional banks shed new light on the systemic important of banks with assets totaling between $100 billion and $250 billion,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to Michael Barr, the vice chair for supervision at the Fed..The dozen lawmakers note that the same 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank gives the Fed latitude in applying tougher regulation on banks in this category – including stronger capital, liquidity, stress testing and resolution plans..“The Fed has a responsibility to ensure financial stability, and in order to fulfill that responsibility, it must ensure that all banks with potential systemic significance are subject to rigorous safety and soundness rules.”
 The lawmakers argue that the federal intervention in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures underscore the systemic risk posed by troubles in banks of this size..The Fed is rethinking some of its own rules related to midsize banks, including potentially ramping up capital and liquidity requirements and stepping up annual “stress tests,” the Wall Street Journal previously reported..“In order to restore sufficient safety practices to the banking system and restore consumers’ confidence in the soundness of their banks, the Fed must immediately exercise its authority to apply enhanced prudential standards and supervision to banks with $100-$250 billion in assets.”
 Warren has long been a regulation hawk, pushing for tough rules to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis and sharply criticizing those who have relaxed rules on banks..‘Serious mistake’
 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..While the Fed may have underestimated how rate rises and its bank oversight would affect the financial system, ""in one way they were remarkably prescient — the Fed has been trying to institutionalize reforms to the discount window designed to improve financial stability in the aftermath of the early-COVID financial crisis,"" wrote Joseph Politano, of Apricitas Economics, in a newsletter Saturday..Faced with ongoing instability in the banking system and persistent consumer price increases, the Federal Reserve has an unusually tricky choice to make between a familiar set of options: raise interest rates or don’t..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase..Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, took a different view, writing in a note Monday that the “Fed can show it knows how to walk and chew gum.”
 While the central bank does not usually increase rates during periods of financial instability, Dutta said, “the Fed has different tools to deal with different problems.” He noted that regulators around the world, including the Fed, have taken steps in recent days to give banks wider access to funding to forestall a broader crisis..What comes next for the banking industry is largely dependent on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision and whether banks remain above water for the time being..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”

 Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with those banks to do its job?.Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?.Yellen said a new emergency lending facility launched by the Fed, along with its existing discount window, are “working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system.”
 But prior to the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, analysts had widely predicted that the Fed would unveil a half-point rate hike..But after the sudden collapse of the two banks that sent shockwaves across the global economy, there has been a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the central bank will pull back, and only raise rates by a quarter-point – in part to try to alleviate concerns that the Fed’s historically aggressive rate hikes over the past year were precisely to blame for this month’s financial turmoil..""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."".The Fed also warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve extended its yearlong fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system..At the same time, the Fed warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 The central bank also signalled that it’s likely nearing the end of its aggressive series of rate hikes..The troubles that suddenly erupted in the banking sector two weeks ago likely led to the Fed’s decision Wednesday to impose a smaller rate hike..Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said: “If this was a systemic crisis, the ECB would not have hiked rates 50 basis points last week.”
 Faced with the risk of a fast-moving loss of confidence, the world’s most powerful central banks announced coordinated action on Monday to support the flow of cash in the financial system, a decision some analysts said could help to address fears over banking sector stability without the need to cut short their interest rate hikes..Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Discussion of whether the central bank has one final rate rise in it before pausing have focused on whether the Bank’s hand will be stayed by the instability we are seeing playing out in the banking sector from Silicon Valley to Switzerland..For some critics of the rate hike effort over the past year, the collapse of the banks adds to their fears that the Fed’s push could destabilize the broader economy..Fed monetary policymakers have had to weigh continuing their aggressive fight on still-high inflation against concerns about the stability of US banks, whose finances have been rocked by those fast-rising interest rates over the past year..Powell has faced sharp criticism for allowing the collapse on his watch as well as reducing oversight of large regional banks with new discretion given to the Fed by a 2018 law that eased some tough regulations put in place after the financial crisis a decade earlier..Despite the federal government's bailout of Silicon Valley Bank depositors, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asserted was done to minimize the risk of financial contagion, investors are clamoring for the Fed to halt monetary tightening..The Fed was stuck with a difficult decision as it balanced whether to keep hiking rates to drive down inflation or ease off the increases given the pain it has already caused for the banking industry, which could drag down the rest of the economy.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

2023-03-22 18:50:00,2023-03-22 18:55:00," you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether this suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward. And I wonder, you know, how can the American people have confidence that there aren't other weaknesses out there in the banking system given that this one got missed as you noted? So let me say what I think happened and then I'll come to the questions around supervision. So at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly. They grew the bank very quickly. They exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Didn't hedge that risk. We now know that supervisors saw these risks and intervened. We know that the public saw all this. We know that SVB experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank room. So this is a very large group of connected depositors, concentrated group of connected depositors and a very, very fast run faster than the historical record would suggest. So as for us, so for our part, we're doing a review of supervision and regulation. My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did this happen? Is the question. What went wrong? Try to find that. You will find that and then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn't happen again and then implement those policies. It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be. I simply can't do that. Vice Chair Barr is leading this and I think he's testifying next week. But that will be up to him. So that's really where it is. The review is going to be thorough and transparent. It is clear to you really to your last question. It's clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and regulation and I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report and I plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation. All right. And the final point, can we feel confident that these weaknesses don't exist elsewhere given that they've omitted this bank? These are not weaknesses that are at all broadly through the banking system. So this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percentage of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk. And again, supervisors did get in there and they were, as you know, obviously, they were on this issue but nonetheless this still happened. So that's really the nature of the interview of sorry of the review is to discover that. Michael McKeith from Bloomberg Radio and Television, you've been very consistent in saying that the Fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time. Following today's decision, the markets have now priced in one more increase in May and then every meeting the rest of this year, they're pricing in rate cuts. Are they getting this totally wrong from the Fed or is there something different about the way you're looking at it given that you're now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing? So we published an SEP today as you will have seen it. It shows that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand in labor market with inflation moving down gradually. In that most likely case, if that happens, participants don't see rate cuts this year. They just don't. I would just say as always, the path of the economy is uncertain and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we're right down in the SEP. But that's not our baseline expectation. Well, if I could follow up and ask, as you look forward into the rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1% basically consensus is based on being, it will be sufficiently restrictive or is it leavened by the idea of you don't know what's going to happen? In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the Fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal? It's going to depend. Remember, we're looking for purposes of our monetary policy tool. We're looking at what's happening among the banks and asking, is there going to be some tightening and credit conditions? And then we're thinking about that as effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do. So in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. So the key is we have to have policies need to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2% over time. It doesn't all have to come from rate hikes. It can come from tighter credit conditions. So we're looking at, and we're, it's highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be. So we're just going to have to watch. In the meantime, obviously at the end of the day, we will",-0.0032112718129993,9,2023-03-22,True,True,False,False,"The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient..The Committee will closely monitor

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 22, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.9 percent, effective March 23, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective March 23, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to
 5 percent, effective March 23, 2023..In taking this action, the Board approved requests to
 establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of
 Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San
 Francisco.","Analysts believe that the sharply rising federal interest rate was a major contributor to the instability of several mid-size banks, most notably the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)..After the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month, the federal government has attempted to maintain confidence in the U.S. banking system, promising to make depositors whole and step in if other banks appear to pose a threat of contagion..Both Republicans and Democrats have pledged tighter oversight of banking regulators following the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which were followed by billions of dollars in losses for financial stocks..The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 tied back partly to the Fed’s recent rate moves: The bank held a lot of long-term securities that had become less valuable as interest rates rose..Earlier this month, the U.S. government said it would make all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank whole after their depositors rushed to pull their money out en masse, causing the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history..“The fall of both SVB and Signature, the near-crash of First Republic, and the struggles of other regional banks shed new light on the systemic important of banks with assets totaling between $100 billion and $250 billion,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to Michael Barr, the vice chair for supervision at the Fed..“Irresponsible and excessive risk taking by SVB and Signature executives should serve as a clear reminder that banks cannot be left to supervise themselves,” Warren and the other Senate Democrats wrote..“The Fed has a responsibility to ensure financial stability, and in order to fulfill that responsibility, it must ensure that all banks with potential systemic significance are subject to rigorous safety and soundness rules.”
 The lawmakers argue that the federal intervention in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures underscore the systemic risk posed by troubles in banks of this size..Days after the bank failures, the Federal Reserve launched a review of the regulation and oversight of Silicon Valley Bank..“In order to restore sufficient safety practices to the banking system and restore consumers’ confidence in the soundness of their banks, the Fed must immediately exercise its authority to apply enhanced prudential standards and supervision to banks with $100-$250 billion in assets.”

 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“Their failures destabilized the financial system in the process and caused federal banking regulators to take measures (such as insuring all the deposits at the two failed banks) that will tempt banks to bet on even bigger risks in the future.”
 
 
 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile..The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the ongoing stress in the regional banking sector (there may be nearly 190 lenders at risk of failure, according to a new study) have put the Federal Reserve in a strange situation..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”
 Allianz economist Mohammed El-Erian also gives the Fed low marks in its inflation fight..The debacles have also put financial regulators on the hot seat, notably the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the overseer of both Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank..Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?.“To call the Fed a ‘bank supervisor’ with bank executives on their boards is absolutely an oxymoron.”
 Silvergate, with $12 billion in deposits, and Silicon Valley Bank, with $160 billion, collapsed for different reasons..On March 13, the Federal Reserve Board announced a review of the supervision of Silicon Valley Bank..Leading the review is Michael Barr, its vice chair for supervision, who said in a statement: “We need to have humility and conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience.” No such review relating to the Fed’s oversight of Silvergate Bank has been announced..Asked about the Fed’s oversight of the two failed banks, he said: “There will always be bad actors and incompetent management teams, but banking regulators exist to stop them before they make multibillion-dollar messes..“The bottom line is that there was a lax regulatory oversight of Silicon Valley’s operations,” Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners LLC, wrote in a note to clients March 12..The relaxed policing was partly due to a less stringent regulatory framework for smaller institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, he concluded, and “partly due to its inept regulatory oversight body, (i.e., the Federal Reserve).”
 At Silvergate, the peril centered on crypto..Fed officials oversaw Silicon Valley Bank, which with $209 billion in assets was the second-largest bank failure in US history..“We wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank didn’t undermine confidence in the soundness of banks around the country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week..Two weeks ago, federal regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank, and later bailed out the bank's depositors, in a move that drew criticism from both sides of the aisle.","The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient..Recent developments are likely to result

 The lawmakers argue that the federal intervention in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures underscore the systemic risk posed by troubles in banks of this size..Days after the bank failures, the Federal Reserve launched a review of the regulation and oversight of Silicon Valley Bank..“In order to restore sufficient safety practices to the banking system and restore consumers’ confidence in the soundness of their banks, the Fed must immediately exercise its authority to apply enhanced prudential standards and supervision to banks with $100-$250 billion in assets.”
 Warren has long been a regulation hawk, pushing for tough rules to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis and sharply criticizing those who have relaxed rules on banks..‘Serious mistake’
 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“Their failures destabilized the financial system in the process and caused federal banking regulators to take measures (such as insuring all the deposits at the two failed banks) that will tempt banks to bet on even bigger risks in the future.”
 
 
 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile..The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the ongoing stress in the regional banking sector (there may be nearly 190 lenders at risk of failure, according to a new study) have put the Federal Reserve in a strange situation..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”
 Allianz economist Mohammed El-Erian also gives the Fed low marks in its inflation fight..The debacles have also put financial regulators on the hot seat, notably the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the overseer of both Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank..Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?.“To call the Fed a ‘bank supervisor’ with bank executives on their boards is absolutely an oxymoron.”
 Silvergate, with $12 billion in deposits, and Silicon Valley Bank, with $160 billion, collapsed for different reasons..On March 13, the Federal Reserve Board announced a review of the supervision of Silicon Valley Bank..Leading the review is Michael Barr, its vice chair for supervision, who said in a statement: “We need to have humility and conduct a careful and thorough review of how we supervised and regulated this firm, and what we should learn from this experience.” No such review relating to the Fed’s oversight of Silvergate Bank has been announced..Asked about the Fed’s oversight of the two failed banks, he said: “There will always be bad actors and incompetent management teams, but banking regulators exist to stop them before they make multibillion-dollar messes..“The bottom line is that there was a lax regulatory oversight of Silicon Valley’s operations,” Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners LLC, wrote in a note to clients March 12..The relaxed policing was partly due to a less stringent regulatory framework for smaller institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, he concluded, and “partly due to its inept regulatory oversight body, (i.e., the Federal Reserve).”
 At Silvergate, the peril centered on crypto..Fed officials oversaw Silicon Valley Bank, which with $209 billion in assets was the second-largest bank failure in US history..Powell has faced sharp criticism for allowing the collapse on his watch as well as reducing oversight of large regional banks with new discretion given to the Fed by a 2018 law that eased some tough regulations put in place after the financial crisis a decade earlier..“We wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank didn’t undermine confidence in the soundness of banks around the country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week..Two weeks ago, federal regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank, and later bailed out the bank's depositors, in a move that drew criticism from both sides of the aisle..The 2018 bill former President Donald Trump signed into law eliminated stress tests for small and mid-sized banks like SVB, meaning oversight wasn't in place for those banks to ensure they could respond to factors like rising interest rates.","The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient..Recent developments are likely to result

 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase..The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the ongoing stress in the regional banking sector (there may be nearly 190 lenders at risk of failure, according to a new study) have put the Federal Reserve in a strange situation..What comes next for the banking industry is largely dependent on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision and whether banks remain above water for the time being..In addition to achieving price stability and financial stability, the Fed’s broader mandate includes supervision of individual financial institutions, Leer says, and “that’s where the failure lies..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”

 At Silvergate, the peril centered on crypto..Existing banks with crypto operations — like Silvergate — seem to have been “waved through without questions” by the Fed, Long said, “while the startups that were seeking permission for everything we did were denied.” All in all, a perplexing paradox, she said..Fed officials oversaw Silicon Valley Bank, which with $209 billion in assets was the second-largest bank failure in US history..Powell has faced sharp criticism for allowing the collapse on his watch as well as reducing oversight of large regional banks with new discretion given to the Fed by a 2018 law that eased some tough regulations put in place after the financial crisis a decade earlier..“We wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank didn’t undermine confidence in the soundness of banks around the country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week..As well as pointing to Wood's massive losses, JPMorgan Asset Management boss Gatch said that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and ""a huge repricing in fixed income"" showed the impact that the Fed's tightening has had on financial markets, according to the FT.
 SVB's share price cratered two weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.8 billion loss on its bond holdings and customers like Peter Thiel's Founders Fund pulled their deposits from the bank..Two weeks ago, federal regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank, and later bailed out the bank's depositors, in a move that drew criticism from both sides of the aisle..The 2018 bill former President Donald Trump signed into law eliminated stress tests for small and mid-sized banks like SVB, meaning oversight wasn't in place for those banks to ensure they could respond to factors like rising interest rates..Since then, investors have been hunting for what bank may be next to fall, and regulators around the world have been trying to strengthen confidence in the industry.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: Silicon Valley Bank, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, rapid and massive bank run, supervisory review, uninsured deposits
2. Second Text: elevated inflation, sound and resilient banking system, tighter credit conditions, policy firming, Federal Open Market Committee, operational tools

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the state and challenges of the U.S. banking system and monetary policy.
2. Both emphasize the importance of adjusting and monitoring monetary policy in response to economic conditions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the failures and risks associated with Silicon Valley Bank and the need for regulatory reform, while the second text focuses on maintaining economic stability and addressing inflation through policy adjustments.
2. The first text presents a narrative of crisis and oversight failure, while the second text conveys a tone of assurance regarding the resilience of the banking system.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text delves into a specific case (Silicon Valley Bank) to underscore broader regulatory issues, while the second text discusses general monetary policy decisions and the overall economic outlook without focusing on a particular institution.
2. The second text contains detailed decisions regarding interest rates and policy implementations made by the Federal Reserve, offering procedural insights not present in the first text.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""bank run"" and ""supervision,"" while the second text employs phrases such as ""policy firming"" and ""operational tools.""
2. The first text refers to ""concentrated group of connected depositors,"" which is a contextual detail specific to the case of Silicon Valley Bank, while the second text references ""Federal Open Market Committee"" as a body making policy decisions.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more negative emotional bias through its critical tone regarding the management of Silicon Valley Bank, stating, ""Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly"" and emphasizing the significant risks that were ignored, such as ""liquidity risk and interest rate risk."" This implies a level of disappointment and concern about the management practices. In contrast, the second text maintains a more reassuring tone, describing the U.S. banking system as ""sound and resilient"" and recognizing that while there are ""tightening credit conditions,"" it suggests a measured approach rather than a crisis mentality. The language in the second text is more optimistic in nature, contrasting the critical stance of the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty  
Explanation: Both texts exhibit a similar level of certainty in their statements. The first text expresses confidence in the review process with phrases like ""we're doing a review of supervision and regulation,"" which highlights a commitment to finding solutions. However, it also mentions significant uncertainty in monetary policy decisions, stating, ""the path of the economy is uncertain."" The second text carries a parallel tone of assurance, indicating, ""The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate"" which reflects a willingness to adapt based on incoming information.

1. The first text provides a more in-depth analysis of the risks faced by SVB, including specific financial risks like interest rate and liquidity risk, while the second text mentions a broader systemic risk context related to various banks.
2. The second text goes into detail about proposed legislation and political reactions, which is not a focus in the first text, making it more politically charged.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""thorough"" and ""transparent"" in reference to the review of supervision, while the second text introduces ""internal watchdog"" and ""legislation"" as specific terms related to regulatory change.
2. The first text references ""participants"" and their expectations in monetary policy discussions, whereas the second text emphasizes ""bi-partisan"" political efforts and ""systemic risk.""","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more neutral
Explanation: The first text maintains a predominantly neutral tone when addressing the issues surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), focusing on the necessity of reviewing supervision and regulatory processes without casting direct blame or overly emotional language. Phrases like ""at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed badly"" convey a critical perspective, yet the overall tone remains matter-of-fact. In contrast, the second text expresses a slightly more negative emotional bias, especially towards the Federal Reserve and its regulatory actions, as seen in phrases such as ""the Fed has found itself wedged between inflation and a banking crisis,"" and ""the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the ongoing stress in the regional banking sector (there may be nearly 190 lenders at risk of failure)."" This language points towards a sense of urgency and frustration, suggesting a more negative outlook on the situation compared to the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty
Explanation: Both texts express a moderate level of certainty in their evaluations. The first text shows a balanced approach, with phrases like ""the path of the economy is uncertain and policy is going to reflect what actually happens,"" indicating an acknowledgment of unpredictability but combined with an assurance that assessments will be based on observable data. Similarly, the second text contains phrases like ""the Fed must immediately exercise its authority to apply enhanced prudential standards,"" which reflects a strong call for action but does not guarantee the outcome of such actions. Both texts convey their points with confidence in their assertions while recognizing the complexities involved, which leads to a conclusion of similar certainty levels."
2023-03-22 18:55:00,2023-03-22 19:00:00," We'll do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent. No one should doubt that. It's going to Rachel Segal. Hi Chair Powell. Rachel Segal from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. I know we've talked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy. But there's also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans that will begin to roll over later this year and next. And that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans. Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of what we saw with SVB to banks that disproportionately are focused on commercial real estate? So we're well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate. I really don't think it's comparable to this. The banking system is strong. It is sound. It is resilient. It's well capitalized. And I really don't see that as at all analogous to this. One other question. Would you be open to an independent investigation separate from the Fed's probe? I welcome. It's 100% certainty that there will be independent investigations and outside investigations and all that. So we welcome. When a bank fails, they're investigations and of course we welcome that. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. The Fed has been rather sticky. So do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster? We don't assume that. We don't give advice to the fiscal authorities. We assume that we take fiscal policy as it comes to our front door, stick it in our model along with a million other things. And we have responsibility for price stability. The Federal Reserve has responsibility for that and nothing is going to change that. And we will get inflation down to 2% in time. And if I can follow on that, but they're working, the spending that's happened is working against what you are doing, right? So it's prolonging inflation? You have to look at the impulse from spending because spending was of course tremendously high during the pandemic. And then as the pandemic programs rolled off, spending actually came down. The sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what's driving inflation right now. It was at the beginning, perhaps part of what was driving inflation, but that's not really the story now. It's going to Neil Irwin. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Two questions about aspects of the government's response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago. First, why is this new bank funding facility done under emergency 133 authority as opposed to expansion of the discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that's been around a long time? And second, can you discuss the federal and the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there's $143 billion on your balance sheets last week supporting that deposit guarantee? Sure. So 133 seemed like the right. We have a little more flexibility on under section 133. We've done quite a lot under the discount window as well. We need to do a special facility that was designed a certain way, so we did it under 133. Really no magic to that. It's only available in unusual and ex-circumstances and it has to be meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place. So with the FDIC, we're lending to the, in effect, we're lending to the bridge bank. So that's where the funds came from. And it's a loan that's 100% guaranteed by the FDIC, so there's no risk for us. Okay, Chris, where's the paper? Thank you, Chris Regaber and Associated Press. The SEB, SEP suggests one more rate hike as does the change in the language in the statement, in which suggests that you're perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes. Do you feel though that if inflation remains high, you'll be able to resume additional hikes as needed or have you somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end? Thank you. Absolutely not. No, we, if we need to raise rates higher, we will. I think for now though, we, as I've mentioned, we see the likelihood of credit tightening. We know that that can have an effect on the macro economy, on demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we're going to be watching to see what that is. And we'll also be watching what's happening with inflation and in the labor market. So we'll be watching all those things. And of course, we will eventually get to tight enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We'll find ourselves at that place. Hi. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.

Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, testified to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates higher and faster in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy..As recently as two weeks ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was telling lawmakers that the central bank was willing to raise rates by as much as necessary to rein in inflation — words that investors interpreted as meaning a large 50-point hike was on the table..Since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, sparking a global banking panic, the Fed has found itself wedged between inflation and a banking crisis..Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector..Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”

 He added: If the Fed does have concerns about some parts of the US banking sector, why weren’t they apparent 3 weeks ago when they were pushing the case for keeping a 0.50% rate hike on the table?.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 tied back partly to the Fed’s recent rate moves: The bank held a lot of long-term securities that had become less valuable as interest rates rose..“Powell’s challenge in the press conference will be to maintain focus on fighting inflation while signaling flexibility in how they deal with the banking crisis,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S..Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in The Financial Times this week that if the Fed doesn’t increase interest rates, it would “set up more policy flip-flops that fail to deliver a soft landing while amplifying unsettling financial volatility.”

 Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with those banks to do its job?.Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?.Yellen said a new emergency lending facility launched by the Fed, along with its existing discount window, are “working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system.”
 But prior to the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, analysts had widely predicted that the Fed would unveil a half-point rate hike..But after the sudden collapse of the two banks that sent shockwaves across the global economy, there has been a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the central bank will pull back, and only raise rates by a quarter-point – in part to try to alleviate concerns that the Fed’s historically aggressive rate hikes over the past year were precisely to blame for this month’s financial turmoil..""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."".The Fed also warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve extended its yearlong fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system..At the same time, the Fed warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 The central bank also signalled that it’s likely nearing the end of its aggressive series of rate hikes..The latest rate hike suggests that Chair Jerome Powell is confident that the Fed can manage a dual challenge: Cool still-high inflation through higher loan rates while defusing the financial upheaval in the banking sector through emergency lending programs and the Biden administration’s decision to cover uninsured deposits at two failed U.S. banks..“Financial stability concerns have resurfaced but inflation still remains uncomfortably high and is showing signs that it won’t fall as far or as fast as hoped.”
 Some economists said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold, while David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crisis, urged the UK central bank to slash rates and stop selling government bonds to shore up the economy..With inflation still high and anxieties gripping the banking industry, the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, will face a complicated task at their latest policy meeting Wednesday and in the months to follow: How to tame inflation by continuing to raise interest rates while also helping to restore faith in the financial system – all without triggering a severe recession..But Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are under pressure from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers to pause the rate hikes to allow the banking sector to stabilize and prevent the economy from tipping into a recession..“We wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank didn’t undermine confidence in the soundness of banks around the country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week..This announcement comes on the heels of positive economic data — inflation slowed in February as the labor market stayed hot, adding 311,000 jobs — but as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously indicated, there's still more work to be done to get the US to its pre-pandemic goal of a 2% inflation level..Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown told Bloomberg last week that the Fed should pause the rate hikes, and Massachusetts Sen.

 This week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen continued to express confidence in the nation's banking system, echoing testimony she gave last week before the Senate Finance Committee that reassured depositors their money would be safe following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank..The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 tied back partly to the Fed’s recent rate moves: The bank held a lot of long-term securities that had become less valuable as interest rates rose..“Powell’s challenge in the press conference will be to maintain focus on fighting inflation while signaling flexibility in how they deal with the banking crisis,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S..‘Serious mistake’
 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase..Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in The Financial Times this week that if the Fed doesn’t increase interest rates, it would “set up more policy flip-flops that fail to deliver a soft landing while amplifying unsettling financial volatility.”

 Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with those banks to do its job?.Amid these failures, a question that took hold during the 2008 financial crisis has resurfaced: Is the Federal Reserve, charged with supervising the banks for which it is the primary regulator, too chummy or aligned with them to do the job?.Yellen said a new emergency lending facility launched by the Fed, along with its existing discount window, are “working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system.”
 But prior to the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, analysts had widely predicted that the Fed would unveil a half-point rate hike..But after the sudden collapse of the two banks that sent shockwaves across the global economy, there has been a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the central bank will pull back, and only raise rates by a quarter-point – in part to try to alleviate concerns that the Fed’s historically aggressive rate hikes over the past year were precisely to blame for this month’s financial turmoil..""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."".The Fed also warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve extended its yearlong fight against high inflation Wednesday by raising its key interest rate a quarter-point despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system..At the same time, the Fed warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 The central bank also signalled that it’s likely nearing the end of its aggressive series of rate hikes..The latest rate hike suggests that Chair Jerome Powell is confident that the Fed can manage a dual challenge: Cool still-high inflation through higher loan rates while defusing the financial upheaval in the banking sector through emergency lending programs and the Biden administration’s decision to cover uninsured deposits at two failed U.S. banks..“Financial stability concerns have resurfaced but inflation still remains uncomfortably high and is showing signs that it won’t fall as far or as fast as hoped.”
 Some economists said the Fed should keep interest rates on hold, while David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee during the 2008 financial crisis, urged the UK central bank to slash rates and stop selling government bonds to shore up the economy..Before the failure of SVB, a rate increase of 0.5 percentage points had been expected in financial markets, after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said more increases would be needed to cool inflation..With inflation still high and anxieties gripping the banking industry, the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, will face a complicated task at their latest policy meeting Wednesday and in the months to follow: How to tame inflation by continuing to raise interest rates while also helping to restore faith in the financial system – all without triggering a severe recession..For some critics of the rate hike effort over the past year, the collapse of the banks adds to their fears that the Fed’s push could destabilize the broader economy..Fed monetary policymakers have had to weigh continuing their aggressive fight on still-high inflation against concerns about the stability of US banks, whose finances have been rocked by those fast-rising interest rates over the past year..But Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are under pressure from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers to pause the rate hikes to allow the banking sector to stabilize and prevent the economy from tipping into a recession..“We wanted to make sure that the problems at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank didn’t undermine confidence in the soundness of banks around the country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last week..This announcement comes on the heels of positive economic data — inflation slowed in February as the labor market stayed hot, adding 311,000 jobs — but as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously indicated, there's still more work to be done to get the US to its pre-pandemic goal of a 2% inflation level..Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown told Bloomberg last week that the Fed should pause the rate hikes, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren blamed Powell directly for SVB's failure, telling NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Powell is trying to ""slow down the economy so that, this is by the Fed's own estimate, 2 million people will lose their jobs..The boost came after US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at an event hosted by the American Bankers Association that the federal government was willing to guarantee more deposits should the current banking meltdown continue.","Inflation remains elevated..Recent developments are likely to result

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 22, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.9 percent, effective March 23, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective March 23, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent..o Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal
 payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS
 received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to
 5 percent, effective March 23, 2023..In taking this action, the Board approved requests to

 Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools
 and approach used to implement monetary policy.","Just days before authorities took control of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, testified to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates higher and faster in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy..“After the Federal Reserve’s failure to properly identify and prevent the shocking failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, it’s clear we can’t wait any longer for big change at the Fed,” Scott said in a release announcing the bill..ET, to understand how recent bank failures are shaping the central bank's policy approach as the Fed chair works to square the challenge of financial system stress with inflation that remains stubbornly high..As recently as two weeks ago, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was telling lawmakers that the central bank was willing to raise rates by as much as necessary to rein in inflation — words that investors interpreted as meaning a large 50-point hike was on the table..Since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, sparking a global banking panic, the Fed has found itself wedged between inflation and a banking crisis..Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector..Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said the Fed “faces a dilemma today” between keeping “the hammer down on inflation or bowing to financial stability concerns,” adding:
 “It will have reservations about hiking for sure in the wake of the SVB-Credit Suisse debacles, but it’s got the inflation dragon to slay and should continue on the path.”
 The speed at which the hikes have rippled through the financial system has picked up, reducing the number of buyers for the government bonds which banks hold because they can be readily sold..Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, called that speculation “a ridiculous notion,” and said it would “send the completely the wrong message at a time when optics are everything.”
 He added: If the Fed does have concerns about some parts of the US banking sector, why weren’t they apparent 3 weeks ago when they were pushing the case for keeping a 0.50% rate hike on the table?.The Fed’s decision to raise rates is likely to put more pressure on regional banks, which will make it harder to avoid a recession..But the Fed’s decision to raise rates by a quarter point on March 22, 2023, and modestly lift its projection for how much higher they will go in 2024 does little to ease the growing concerns about the health of regional banks..And while the Fed has said it stands at the ready to provide liquidity to banks, that won’t stop depositors from moving their money into safer institutions offering higher returns – which increases the risk of further bank runs, similar to those that felled Silicon Valley Bank..Advertisement
 This week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen continued to express confidence in the nation's banking system, echoing testimony she gave last week before the Senate Finance Committee that reassured depositors their money would be safe following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank..The failure of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 tied back partly to the Fed’s recent rate moves: The bank held a lot of long-term securities that had become less valuable as interest rates rose..“Powell’s challenge in the press conference will be to maintain focus on fighting inflation while signaling flexibility in how they deal with the banking crisis,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S..“The Fed has a responsibility to ensure financial stability, and in order to fulfill that responsibility, it must ensure that all banks with potential systemic significance are subject to rigorous safety and soundness rules.”
 The lawmakers argue that the federal intervention in the wake of the SVB and Signature failures underscore the systemic risk posed by troubles in banks of this size..‘Serious mistake’
 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“Their failures destabilized the financial system in the process and caused federal banking regulators to take measures (such as insuring all the deposits at the two failed banks) that will tempt banks to bet on even bigger risks in the future.”
 
 
 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase..Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote in The Financial Times this week that if the Fed doesn’t increase interest rates, it would “set up more policy flip-flops that fail to deliver a soft landing while amplifying unsettling financial volatility.”
 In an interview with Bloomberg this week, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said the Fed should be wary of falling prey to financial dominance — when the Fed doesn’t tighten monetary policy because of potential risks to the stability of the financial system..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”
 Allianz economist Mohammed El-Erian also gives the Fed low marks in its inflation fight..“Having already dug itself, and the US economy, into a big hole with its prolonged mischaracterization of inflation and flip-flopping policies, it can ill afford another slippage in what is proving to be the biggest policy mistake in the last four decades.”

2023-03-22 19:00:00,2023-03-22 19:05:00, At what point the financial supports that the Fed is extending through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reducing the balance sheet. And I'm also curious what your thoughts are on the not just the availability of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks. So people think of QE and QT in different ways so let me be clear about how I'm thinking about these recent developments. So recent liquidity provision that has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer term securities. Large scale purchases of long term securities are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down pushing up the price and down the rates longer term rates which supports demand through channels we understand fairly well. The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet the special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions. It's not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy. We do believe that it's working it's having its intended effect of bolstering confidence into the banking system and thereby forstalling what might otherwise have been in abrupt and outsized tightening and financial conditions. So that's working. In terms of the distribution of reserves we don't see ourselves as running into reserve shortages. We think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to run off predictably and passively is working. And of course we're always prepared to change that if that changes but we don't see any evidence that that's changed. Hi Chair. A lettering a survival with Bloomberg news. The minutes of the January February meeting the last meeting indicate that you discuss the possibility of runs on non bank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios. Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion kind of what was talked about in light of that. And then why didn't the Fed do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent what happened this month. I mean to be honest I don't recall the specifics of that. It's been quite an interesting seven weeks. But I will tell you though that we have there have been presentations about interest rate risk. I mean it's been in all the newspapers. It's not a surprise that there are institutions that have that have had unhedged long positions in long duration securities that have lost value as as longer term rates have gone up due to our rate increases. So that's that's not a surprise. I think as you know as is as is now on the public record the supervisory team was apparently engaged very much engaged with the bank. Repeatedly and was escalating but you know nonetheless what happened happened. And so that's really the purpose of one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Bar is conducting is to try to understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we need to change. I mean one one thing is the speed of the come back to that the speed of the run it's it's very different for what we've seen in the past. And it does kind of suggest that there's a need for possible regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision regulation need to keep up with what's happening in the world. Can you confirm whether or not the board knew about these escalations by the exam examiners in San Francisco. I will have to come back to you on that. I don't know. Simon or Brinavitch with the economist thank you very much. Chair Powell you've stated twice today that all depositors savings in the banking system are safe. Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings. Shouldn't Congress have a say in that. And just by way of example if a bank with less than a billion dollars in assets failed are you promising to be allowed all of its depositors. Well I'm not saying anything more than I'm saying so but what I'm saying is you've seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy or to or to the financial system. And we prepare to use those tools and I think depositors should assume that they're that their deposits are safe. Good. Thank you chair Powell Greg Robb from Markerwatch I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color you gave just a little bit of color you said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend you said the question you guys asked was how did this.,-0.0040395423524689,11,2023-03-22,True,True,False,False,"Recent developments are likely to result

 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 22, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the

 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:

 But prior to the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, analysts had widely predicted that the Fed would unveil a half-point rate hike..But after the sudden collapse of the two banks that sent shockwaves across the global economy, there has been a growing belief among Wall Street analysts that the central bank will pull back, and only raise rates by a quarter-point – in part to try to alleviate concerns that the Fed’s historically aggressive rate hikes over the past year were precisely to blame for this month’s financial turmoil..""The Fed will likely stress that another hike is needed to cool the economy and tame inflation, which remains well above their target, but also highlight the actions taken and tools available to them to help alleviate the stress in the banking system."".At the same time, the Fed warned that the financial upheaval stemming from the collapse of two major banks is “likely to result in tighter credit conditions” and “weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation.”
 The central bank also signalled that it’s likely nearing the end of its aggressive series of rate hikes..Fed monetary policymakers have had to weigh continuing their aggressive fight on still-high inflation against concerns about the stability of US banks, whose finances have been rocked by those fast-rising interest rates over the past year..Powell has faced sharp criticism for allowing the collapse on his watch as well as reducing oversight of large regional banks with new discretion given to the Fed by a 2018 law that eased some tough regulations put in place after the financial crisis a decade earlier..Despite the federal government's bailout of Silicon Valley Bank depositors, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen asserted was done to minimize the risk of financial contagion, investors are clamoring for the Fed to halt monetary tightening..About $300 billion in assets added to Fed balance sheet in the last week pic.twitter.com/a46TLAkFwr — Genevieve Roch-Decter, CFA (@GRDecter) March 16, 2023

And getting to the seriousness of it, how are you going to ensure that banks comply with these citations take them seriously? How will you enforce them? That is a great question. And is right in the heart of what the review will be doing under Vice Chair of Barr's leadership. So I think that's what you think about. What can we do to make sure that? But again, that's not for me to answer today. Do you have specific thoughts on that? Well, I see if I did, I wouldn't share them, because I really, this review is going on. And I want nothing other than us to find out what happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes. That's all I want. It's for me to be giving you my half-form to or partially informed thoughts. It just isn't appropriate. There's a real serious review going on with people from all of the Federal Reserve system who are not connected to this work, not connected to this bank. And under, again, Vice Chair of Barr's leadership, and I'm confident that it will produce a satisfactory result. OK. We'll go to Jennifer for the last question. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. Carrie, how do you view financial conditions right now? If credit becomes expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you're watching for, would that situation warrant a rate cut? What situation would warrant a rate cut? And have the bank failures prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff? Thank you. So we haven't really talked about changing the balance sheet implementation. That's not something we've discussed yet. As I mentioned, we're always willing to change that if we conclude that it's appropriate, but we're really not seeing any signs there. Sorry. Then the question before that was just give me a... Carrie, how you view financial conditions now, and if credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut. So financial conditions seem to have tightened, and probably by more than the traditional indexes say, because the traditional indexes are focused a lot on rates and equities, and they don't necessarily capture lending conditions. So we think that, though. So there are other measures, which if they're focused on bank lending conditions and things like that, they show some more tightening. The question for us, though, is how significant will that be and how will we be the extent of it, and will be the duration of it? And then once you know that, there's a fair amount of research about how that, with broad uncertainty bands, how that works its way into the economy over what period of time. And so we'll be looking to see the first part of that, how serious is this, and does it look like it's going to be sustained? And if it is, it could easily have a significant macroeconomic effect, and we would factor that into our policy decisions. I mentioned with rate cuts. Rate cuts are not in our base case. And so that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you very much.",0.0022444141826801,12,2023-03-22,True,False,False,False,"Recent developments are likely to result

 He added: If the Fed does have concerns about some parts of the US banking sector, why weren’t they apparent 3 weeks ago when they were pushing the case for keeping a 0.50% rate hike on the table?.“Powell’s challenge in the press conference will be to maintain focus on fighting inflation while signaling flexibility in how they deal with the banking crisis,” Michael Feroli, Chief U.S..“The fall of both SVB and Signature, the near-crash of First Republic, and the struggles of other regional banks shed new light on the systemic important of banks with assets totaling between $100 billion and $250 billion,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to Michael Barr, the vice chair for supervision at the Fed..The dozen lawmakers note that the same 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank gives the Fed latitude in applying tougher regulation on banks in this category – including stronger capital, liquidity, stress testing and resolution plans..“The Fed has a responsibility to ensure financial stability, and in order to fulfill that responsibility, it must ensure that all banks with potential systemic significance are subject to rigorous safety and soundness rules.”

 However, the role of the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank is hotly debated
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, recently told CNN’s Kate Bolduan he doesn’t know if the easing of stress test requirements “would have forestalled” the bank failures, adding these stress tests “couldn’t have hurt.”
 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”
 In a note to clients Monday, economists at Goldman Sachs said that while policymakers at the Fed and in Europe have responded aggressively to shore up the global financial system, “markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient.”
 As a result, they wrote, they “think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now” and will hold off on another increase..What comes next for the banking industry is largely dependent on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision and whether banks remain above water for the time being..The SVB fiasco provided the first true opportunity to pressure test the supervisory framework established by Dodd-Frank just over 10 years ago, and the results are abysmal.”

 Sheila Bair, a Republican and the former chair of the FDIC during the 2008 crisis, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow she doesn’t think there is “some broad problem because of deregulation with regional banks.”
 Patricia McCoy, a former federal regulator, told CNN on Tuesday that the events of the past ten days have shown the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank for banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion asset range was a “serious mistake.”
 “Fast forward five years, and two of those banks – Silicon Valley and Signature Bank – failed due to lack of liquidity and possible undercapitalization,” McCoy, now a professor at Boston College Law School, said in an email..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”

 The Federal Reserve is grappling with a hazier economic picture, clouded by turmoil in the banking industry and still-high inflation, just as it meets to decide....At the time, Powell said that issuing economic and interest rate forecasts, when the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were so unclear, “could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help.” Still, the unusual decision then was as much a reflection of the chaos of the early pandemic as it was of the uncertain outlook..Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has spoken of the importance of fighting inflation with rate hikes, but the fast pace of increases has been firmly linked with the outbreak of chaos in the banking sector..Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, called that speculation “a ridiculous notion,” and said it would “send the completely the wrong message at a time when optics are everything.”

 Historic Federal Reserve lending to banks in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse punched a huge hole in its effort to shrink the size of its balance sheet, though economists don't view that turnaround as a shift back toward a stimulative use of its asset stockpile..“It’s just not easy for them right now.”

This conveys confidence in the existence of a systematic approach moving forward. Conversely, the second text reflects a lower certainty level, primarily illustrated by speculative remarks such as ""we have seen a series of bank failures"" and ""it’s likely to result in tighter credit conditions"", which imply ambiguity and concerns about the effectiveness of current measures. The language used in the second text indicates an environment of doubt and concerns about regulatory effectiveness."
2023-05-03 18:30:00,2023-05-03 18:35:00," Good afternoon. Before discussing today's meeting, let me comment briefly on recent developments in the banking sector. Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode, and we will work to prevent events like these from happening again. As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision and Bars review of the Federal Reserve's supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank. The reviews findings underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I'm confident that we will do so. From the perspective of monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Since early last year, we've raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. We're also continuing to reduce our securities holdings. Looking ahead, we'll take a data dependent approach in determining the extent to which additional policy-forming may be appropriate. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below trend pace of 0.9 percent. The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest at 1.1 percent despite a pickup in consumer spending. Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. The labor market remains very tight. Over the first three months of the year, job gains averaged 345,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate remained very low in March at 3.5 percent. Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are coming back into better balance. The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years. All wage growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies have declined so far this year. But overall, labor demands still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent. Following the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent. Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year. Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5 and a quarter percent, and we are continuing to the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.

 The wide range of potential outcomes could provoke divisions among Fed officials, even as they’re expected to raise their benchmark rate to 5.1%, the highest level in 16 years

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..Taming inflation remains the Fed’s top priority, but even some central bank officials have expressed greater caution in determining additional hikes after the failure of three US regional banks in two months, including the collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday..“At moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience — for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a forum last month..At the Fed’s last meeting, officials voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point, citing data that pointed to persistently high inflation and stronger-than-expected economic activity in the beginning of the year..Swift action from regulators quelled fears of broader financial contagion, and the Fed’s assessment of March’s banking turbulence showed that banks failed because of mismanagement and insufficient enforcement action from regulators..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”
 Tighter credit conditions help the Fed curb demand to bring down inflation..""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit."".The central bank may have given a nod toward the possibility in its statement, where it dropped a reference saying it ""anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”
 But it stopped short of declaring the end to rate hikes, which have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking system and sent stock prices well below their record heights..“A pause in rate actions is therefore appropriate, but further tightening is plausible should inflation prove sticky.”
 Inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and it's still hurting households trying to keep up..""Unless and until the Fed were to see actual strains on the banking sector, we believe it will stick with its stated view from the March meeting that U.S. banks remain sound and resilient."".If the Fed continues to raise rates and doesn't pause, that is only going to create a bigger problem because most of these regional banks are suffering because of the higher rate structure."".What's your call today on how the Fed moves forward with policy?.The Fed’s rate increases over the past 14 months have more than doubled mortgage rates, elevated the costs of auto loans, credit card borrowing and business loans and heightened the risk of a recession..“Inflation remains elevated.”
 The surge in rates has contributed to the collapse of three large banks and turmoil in the banking industry..The Fed's interest rate decision, announced on Wednesday, comes against the backdrop of both still-high inflation and the persistent turmoil in the banking industry.","Tighter credit conditions for households
 and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation..The Committee will closely monitor

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..The Fed wouldn't want to risk financial stability just when inflation is already headed lower,” said Sheth.Amid economic slowdown and banking crisis in the US, crude oil prices have come down significantly in the last one year..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..While retail inflation in the US fell for the ninth consecutive month to 5% in March, it is still above the Fed’s target of 2%.Multinational bank ING said in a note that “inflation remains unacceptably high, but banking stresses are leading to a tightening of lending conditions.”Wage inflation, too, has remained robust, which is feeding demand-side inflation – the average hourly earnings increased from 4.4% in January to 4.6% in February..Taming inflation remains the Fed’s top priority, but even some central bank officials have expressed greater caution in determining additional hikes after the failure of three US regional banks in two months, including the collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday..“At moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience — for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a forum last month..At the Fed’s last meeting, officials voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point, citing data that pointed to persistently high inflation and stronger-than-expected economic activity in the beginning of the year..Swift action from regulators quelled fears of broader financial contagion, and the Fed’s assessment of March’s banking turbulence showed that banks failed because of mismanagement and insufficient enforcement action from regulators..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..The Fed wouldn't want to risk financial stability just when inflation is already headed lower,” said Sheth.Amid economic slowdown and banking crisis in the US, crude oil prices have come down significantly in the last one year..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..While retail inflation in the US fell for the ninth consecutive month to 5% in March, it is still above the Fed’s target of 2%.Multinational bank ING said in a note that “inflation remains unacceptably high, but banking stresses are leading to a tightening of lending conditions.”Wage inflation, too, has remained robust, which is feeding demand-side inflation – the average hourly earnings increased from 4.4% in January to 4.6% in February..ING expects rate cuts to begin as soon as November this year.Analysts at Nomura also note that a 25 bps hike is likely on Wednesday, but going forward, the monetary policy tightening could come to an end.“There appears to have been uptake in emergency borrowings at the San Francisco Fed region, even after adjusting for the impact of quantitative tightening, which might be related to continued news of stress at the First Republic Bank,” the brokerage said, adding that it expects rate cuts to start in March 2024.All in all, the consensus is that the FOMC is highly likely to deliver one last 25 bps rate hike today while keeping a close watch on inflation..Taming inflation remains the Fed’s top priority, but even some central bank officials have expressed greater caution in determining additional hikes after the failure of three US regional banks in two months, including the collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday..“At moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience — for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a forum last month..At the Fed’s last meeting, officials voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point, citing data that pointed to persistently high inflation and stronger-than-expected economic activity in the beginning of the year..Swift action from regulators quelled fears of broader financial contagion, and the Fed’s assessment of March’s banking turbulence showed that banks failed because of mismanagement and insufficient enforcement action from regulators..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”
 Tighter credit conditions help the Fed curb demand to bring down inflation..""Strains in the banking sector continue to cause headaches at the Fed, while the Treasury worries about the debt limit,"" SocGen's Kit Juckes wrote..""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit."".In the portion of the statement where the Fed provides guidance, Mericle expects to see a sentence that could look something like, ""The Committee anticipates that the stance of monetary policy will most likely be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time but will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy."".The central bank may have given a nod toward the possibility in its statement, where it dropped a reference saying it ""anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”
 But it stopped short of declaring the end to rate hikes, which have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking system and sent stock prices well below their record heights..“A pause in rate actions is therefore appropriate, but further tightening is plausible should inflation prove sticky.”
 Inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and it's still hurting households trying to keep up..""Unless and until the Fed were to see actual strains on the banking sector, we believe it will stick with its stated view from the March meeting that U.S. banks remain sound and resilient."".If the Fed continues to raise rates and doesn't pause, that is only going to create a bigger problem because most of these regional banks are suffering because of the higher rate structure."".What's your call today on how the Fed moves forward with policy?.The Fed’s rate increases over the past 14 months have more than doubled mortgage rates, elevated the costs of auto loans, credit card borrowing and business loans and heightened the risk of a recession..“Inflation remains elevated.”
 The surge in rates has contributed to the collapse of three large banks and turmoil in the banking industry..“We should gather further data and be careful about raising rates too aggressively.”

2. The first text discusses the socio-economic implications of inflation, detailing its effect on purchasing power, while the second text lacks this qualitative economic context and is more technical in nature.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""price stability,"" ""inflation expectations,"" and ""job gains,"" while the second text introduces phrases such as ""dollar roll transactions,"" ""coupon swap transactions,"" and ""effective May 4, 2023,"" which are not present in the first text.
2. The first text refers to ""employment"" and ""economic growth,"" while the second text uses different terminology focused on ""credit conditions"" and the ""Board of Governors' decisions.""","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text generally conveys a more optimistic tone through phrases such as ""broadly improved,"" ""the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient,"" and ""I'm confident that we will do so."" These phrases exhibit a subtle positivity regarding the banking sector and a proactive commitment to addressing challenges. In contrast, the second text predominantly presents a more neutral or cautious outlook, indicated by phrases like ""inflation remains elevated"" and ""tighter credit conditions... are likely to weigh on economic activity.""

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. Phrases such as ""conditions in that sector have broadly improved"" and ""the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient"" indicate optimism regarding the financial system's recovery and stability. Additionally, the text expresses confidence in the actions being taken to address inflation with phrases like ""I’m confident that we will do so"" and ""we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal."" In contrast, the second text reflects a more cautious sentiment with statements like ""the Fed is still battling inflation,"" ""remain well above the Fed’s 2% target,"" and ""concerns that the Fed might have to further tighten credit."" These phrases denote a more negative outlook and signal a struggle in achieving economic goals.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a higher level of certainty than the second text. It clearly asserts the Federal Reserve's goals and commitments, for example, stating ""we are committed to learning the right lessons"" and ""price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve."" This language signals strong conviction in the Federal Reserve's actions and future policies. Conversely, the second text expresses a lower level of certainty, with phrases such as ""the big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday"" and ""could weaken the economy if…"" suggesting speculation and indecision about the Fed's future actions. These elements contribute to a more ambiguous outlook, contrasting the decisiveness presented in the first text."
2023-05-03 18:35:00,2023-05-03 18:40:00," We have raised interest rates by five percentage points in a little more than a year. We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit conditions. Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook. But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses. In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with monetary policy restraint we've put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We will make that determination meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We are prepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep our longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Increasing inflation is likely to require a period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thanks, Deena. Hi, Gina Smyla. Can you our times? Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes. If so, what a recession like what they're envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate. So taking your question, of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A decision on a pause was not made today. We will have noticed that in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is not in the statement anymore. We took that out and instead we're saying that in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% over time, the committee will take into account certain factors. That's a meaningful change that we're no longer saying that we anticipate. We'll be driven by incoming data, meeting by meeting and we'll approach that question at the June meeting. So the staff's forecast is, so let me say start by saying that that's not my own most likely case, which is really that the economy will continue to grow at a modest rate this year. And I think that's so different people in the committee have different forecasts. That's my own assessment of the most likely path. Staff produces its own forecast and it's independent of the forecasts of the participants, which include the governors and the reserve bank presidents of course. And we think this is a healthy thing that the staff is writing down what they really think they're not especially influenced by what the governors think and vice versa. The governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it's actually good that the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession and by that I would characterize as one in which the rising unemployment is smaller than has been typical in modern era recessions. I wouldn't want to characterize the staff's forecast for this meeting. We'll leave that to the minutes.

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..While retail inflation in the US fell for the ninth consecutive month to 5% in March, it is still above the Fed’s target of 2%.Multinational bank ING said in a note that “inflation remains unacceptably high, but banking stresses are leading to a tightening of lending conditions.”Wage inflation, too, has remained robust, which is feeding demand-side inflation – the average hourly earnings increased from 4.4% in January to 4.6% in February..Taming inflation remains the Fed’s top priority, but even some central bank officials have expressed greater caution in determining additional hikes after the failure of three US regional banks in two months, including the collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday..At the Fed’s last meeting, officials voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point, citing data that pointed to persistently high inflation and stronger-than-expected economic activity in the beginning of the year..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m, and the post-meeting statement, will offer clues on whether additional rate increases are likely in the months ahead, and how credit conditions have shaped up in the seven weeks since the first bank failure..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..But particularly if political battles around the debt ceiling worsen, the economy could fall into a deep enough recession that the Fed might be forced to cut interest rates some time this year – even if inflation isn’t fully in check..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..While retail inflation in the US fell for the ninth consecutive month to 5% in March, it is still above the Fed’s target of 2%.Multinational bank ING said in a note that “inflation remains unacceptably high, but banking stresses are leading to a tightening of lending conditions.”Wage inflation, too, has remained robust, which is feeding demand-side inflation – the average hourly earnings increased from 4.4% in January to 4.6% in February..Core inflation, on the other hand, remained elevated at 5.54% in February.On the other hand, the US' gross domestic product (GDP) grew at just 1.1% in the March quarter, as against expectations of 2% growth.Data from the US Fed also underlined the elevated stress amongst regional banks, with emergency borrowings rising for the second consecutive week at the end of April by $11.3 billion.The analysts at ING added that while a 25 bps hike is a given, the rationale for further rate hikes is “highly questionable” given the stress in the US banking sector..ING expects rate cuts to begin as soon as November this year.Analysts at Nomura also note that a 25 bps hike is likely on Wednesday, but going forward, the monetary policy tightening could come to an end.“There appears to have been uptake in emergency borrowings at the San Francisco Fed region, even after adjusting for the impact of quantitative tightening, which might be related to continued news of stress at the First Republic Bank,” the brokerage said, adding that it expects rate cuts to start in March 2024.All in all, the consensus is that the FOMC is highly likely to deliver one last 25 bps rate hike today while keeping a close watch on inflation..Taming inflation remains the Fed’s top priority, but even some central bank officials have expressed greater caution in determining additional hikes after the failure of three US regional banks in two months, including the collapse of First Republic Bank on Monday..“At moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience — for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a forum last month..At the Fed’s last meeting, officials voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point, citing data that pointed to persistently high inflation and stronger-than-expected economic activity in the beginning of the year..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m, and the

2023-05-03 18:40:00,2023-05-03 18:45:00," Thank you, Chair Powell, for the seagull from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt limit stand off. You said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised. But do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default and what type of situation would that look like? So I wouldn't want to speculate specifically, but I will say this. These are fiscal policy matters for starters, and they're for Congress and the administration for the elected parts of the government to deal with, and they're really consigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this. It's essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they're due. A failure to do that would be unprecedented. We'd be in uncharted territory and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse. So I'll just leave it there. We don't give advice to either side. We just would point out that it's very important that this be done. The other point I'll make about that though is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential short and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. It would be so uncertain that it's just as important that this – we never get to a place where we're actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government's not paying its bills. And just to follow up, was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff? Did that affect today's monetary policy decision at all? I wouldn't say that it did. It was – of course, it's something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the outlook and that will – that come up – a number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn't say that it was important in today's monetary policy decision yet. Steve. Oh, thank you, Yemen. Steve Leigh's been CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you will inform that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks? Can you tell me what supervisory actions you've done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk? And kind of part three, but it's all the same question here. Do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy at supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you. Sure. So, the February 14 presentation, I didn't remember it very well, but now, of course, I've gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole board, the entire board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank which talked about the amount of losses they are marked to market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about that I recall anyway about the risk of a bank run. So it was, I think, the takeaway was they were going a way to do an assessment of vertical, sorry, a horizontal assessment of banks. It wasn't presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as an informational, non-decision kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation. And as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we're doing, of course, I think banks themselves, or many, many banks, are now attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since the events of early March to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. You know, like so many things, it's very useful. But ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They're both working well together. We've used our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And at the same time, we've been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I don't need to be argumentative, but the staff report said S.V.B. has significant interest rate risk. It said interest rate risk measurements failed at S.V.B. And it said banks with large unrealized losses faced significant safety and soundness risk. Why was that not alarming? Well, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't alarming. It was, they're pointing out something that they're working on and that they're on the case that, you know, that I'm not sure whether they mentioned, I think they did actually.

 Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..Chair Jerome Powell and other committee members of the Federal Reserve are likely to announce a decision on rate hike on Wednesday, May 3.While the market
 Chair Jerome Powell and other committee members of the Federal Reserve are likely to announce a decision on rate hike on Wednesday, May 3..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..“At moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience — for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy,” Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a forum last month..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m, and the post-meeting statement, will offer clues on whether additional rate increases are likely in the months ahead, and how credit conditions have shaped up in the seven weeks since the first bank failure..“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”
 Tighter credit conditions help the Fed curb demand to bring down inflation..""Strains in the banking sector continue to cause headaches at the Fed, while the Treasury worries about the debt limit,"" SocGen's Kit Juckes wrote..""Strategically if the Fed doesn’t want markets to price in cuts, it should send a message that a pause could be followed by hikes as well as cuts if that is what the data say – as it stands the market only sees one way risk once there is a pause."".If that happens, the focus will be on whether or how hard Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back on investors' expectations for rate cuts by year's end..Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, on March 22, 2023..Multiple factors will come into play as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues point to where monetary policy is heading..""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit."".In the portion of the statement where the Fed provides guidance, Mericle expects to see a sentence that could look something like, ""The Committee anticipates that the stance of monetary policy will most likely be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time but will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy."".""Unless and until the Fed were to see actual strains on the banking sector, we believe it will stick with its stated view from the March meeting that U.S. banks remain sound and resilient."".We'll hear from central bank chief Jerome Powell today at 2 p.m..In this March 21, 2018, file photo, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington..What's your call today on how the Fed moves forward with policy?.Chair Jerome Powell had said in March that a cutback in lending by banks, to shore up their finances, could act as the equivalent of a quarter-point rate hike in slowing the economy..The Fed is now also grappling with the threat of a prolonged standoff around the nation’s borrowing limit, which caps how much debt the government can issue..Wall Street traders were also unnerved by this week’s announcement from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the nation could default on its debt as soon as June 1 unless Congress agrees to lift the debt limit, which caps how much the government can borrow..If that happens, focus will be on whether or how hard Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back on investors' expectations for rate cuts by year's end.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text conveys a sense of urgency and concern regarding the potential consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling, stating that ""a failure to do that would be unprecedented"" and the ""consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse."" These phrases reflect a slightly negative emotional bias, emphasizing risk and uncertainty. In contrast, the second text maintains a more neutral tone, focusing on monetary policy decisions with phrases like ""The Committee will closely monitor incoming information"" and ""the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate."" The first text's use of ""highly uncertain"" and ""could be quite averse"" juxtaposes with the second text’s more measured language, thus indicating a slightly more negative outlook in the first text.

For instance, phrases such as ""the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could be quite averse"" indicate a concern for economic instability, portraying a sense of alarm. In contrast, the second text retains a more neutral tone, highlighting potential outcomes without expressing a clear emotional bias. For example, it states, ""the big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases,"" which conveys uncertainty but lacks a directly negative outlook regarding the implications for the economy.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty through phrases like ""the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain"" and ""it would be so uncertain that it's just as important,"" which emphasize doubt and the unpredictable nature of economic conditions. This contrasts with the second text, which employs a more assertive tone, noting that ""the Fed has waged...,"" a statement that implies a level of confidence in the Fed's actions. While both texts mention uncertainties, the first text's repeated focus on uncertainty suggests a greater level of doubt compared to the more confident assertions within the second text."
2023-05-03 18:55:00,2023-05-03 19:00:00," which might be 3%, so you've got 2% real rates that's meaningfully above what most people would, many people anyway, would assess as the neutral rate. So policy is tight, and you see that in interest-interensive activities, and you also begin to see it more and more in other activities. And if you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that's ongoing, I think you feel like we may not be far off or possibly even at that level. Thank you, Edward. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3% inflation as the projections show at the end of this year, or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3% inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2% target? I think we're always going to have 2% as our target. We're always going to be focusing on getting there. And be okay with a prolonged 3%. You know what? Let me just say that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for inflation going down to 2% over time. I mean, we, that's not a question that's in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. We're not looking to get to 3% and then drop our tools. We have a goal of getting to 2%. We think it's going to take some time. We don't think it'll be a smooth process. And I think we're going to need to stay at this for a while. How does the other side of the mandate, the jobs side, want you to get to 3% going from 3 to 2? How does the other side of the mandate, with balance? I think they will both matter equally at that point. Right now you have a labor market that's still extraordinarily tight. You've still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening and labor market conditions, but overall, you're near a 50 year low unemployment wages. You all will have seen the wage number from late last week and it's, you know, whenever it was. And, you know, it's a couple of percentage points above what would be consistent with 2% inflation over time. So we do see some softening. We see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But labor market is very, very strong. Whereas inflation is, you know, running high, well above our goal. And right now we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we've been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Bozo with Bloomberg News. So many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed officials' projections did imply or seem to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecasts as well, given the strong first quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I'm just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you're optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that's the staff's forecast, possibly also the broader committee's forecast as well. And also, of course, most private sector forecasters. Yeah, I don't think, you know, I know what's printed in the summary of economic projections and all that. I don't think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think. Because you don't know what they were thinking for first quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I'll just say, I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different. And the reason is there's just so much excess demand really in the labor market. It's interesting is, you know, we've raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months. And the unemployment rate is 3.5 percent. Pretty much where it was even lower than it where it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see by surveys and much, much evidence that conditions are cooling gradually. But it really is different. You know, it wasn't supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much as they've declined without unemployment going up. Well, that's what we've seen. So we, there are no promises in this, but it just seems to me that it's possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I fully appreciate that. That would be against the pattern. But I do think that this, that the situation in the labor market with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually, wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down. And that's a good sign, down to more sustainable levels. So I think that, I think it's still possible. I, you know, I think, you know, the, the kids, you know, the, the kids, you know, the kids, you know, the kids, you know, the kids, you know, the kids, you know, the kids, you",0.001026083155236,16,2023-05-03,True,False,False,False,"The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of

 But it stopped short of declaring the end to rate hikes, which have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking system and sent stock prices well below their record heights..“A pause in rate actions is therefore appropriate, but further tightening is plausible should inflation prove sticky.”

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
 stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on May 3, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.15 percent, effective May 4, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective May 4, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 5 to 5-1/4 percent..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to
 5.25 percent, effective May 4, 2023..-2-
 This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market
 Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools
 and approach used to implement monetary policy.","Fed Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged in the past that aggressively raising rates would bring “some pain” for households but said that doing so is necessary to crush high inflation..The central bank is still battling inflation, which has come down from 40-year highs reached in June 2022 but that remains well above the Fed’s 2% target..""A 25bp hike and a heavy hint (at least) that we will then see a pause, is the consensus view of today’s Fed meeting..Still, the Nomura economists think that Fed chair Powell will make clear that near-term rate cuts are unlikely, ""pushing against the current market pricing of a couple of rate cuts by the end of this year."".On the other hand, inflation, while slowing, is persisting at a level far above the central bank’s 2% target rate, raising concerns that the Fed might have to further tighten credit to slow price increases..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases — barring any re-acceleration of inflation — and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..The statement reiterated that the Fed ""will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments."".Taken together, the moves are at least a tenuous nod that while tight policy could remain in effect, the path ahead is less clear for actual interest rate hikes as policymakers assess incoming data and financial conditions..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it's now inclined to pause its rate increases — barring any re-acceleration of inflation — and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..Step back: The Fed has swiftly raised interest rates in a bid to tame inflation, which fell to an annual rate of 5% in March but remains way above its target..The Fed knows it’s pushing rates to an uncomfortable level..In an emailed statement, Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said that with inflation still elevated and sticky and with the broad economic picture still looking ""fairly robust,"" the Fed is actually more likely than not to keep additional rate hikes on the table..""Provided the economic data slows only gently and inflation remains elevated, and the banking sector volatility is fairly contained, we think a June hike is still possible,"" she wrote..In a note to clients published Sunday, the group said it expects the Fed to strike a “hawkish” tone in its latest language announcing the expected rate hike — meaning it will indicate inflation has not yet been tamed and, therefore, interest rates must remain elevated for longer..""We believe that continuing to raise interest rates would be an abandonment of the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve both maximum employment and price stability and show little regard for the small businesses and working families that will get caught in the wreckage,” they wrote..Analysts at Nomura global financial services group offered something of a middle ground: While they forecast the Fed will raise the rate by the expected 0.25%, it will prove a “dovish hike” as the central bankers replace previous language that signaled additional hikes will be necessary, planning to take a more wait-and-see approach..Follow her on Twitter @daniromerotv

1. First Text: real rates, job openings, excess demand, cooling in the labor market, prolonged 3%
2. Second Text: maximum employment, cumulative tightening, inflation expectations, federal funds rate, monetary policy firming

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss inflation rates and the target of returning inflation to 2%.
2. Both address the labor market and its impact on economic activity and inflation.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the complexity and challenges of achieving the inflation target, reflecting a more cautious and analytical perspective, whereas the second text has a more procedural tone focused on the Federal Reserve's policy actions.
2. The first text includes more detailed discussions about labor market conditions and job openings, while the second text is more focused on policy decisions and inflation targets.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a narrative on the implications of the labor market and potential recession risks, while the second text outlines the specific actions taken by the Federal Reserve in relation to monetary policy.
2. The first text discusses the possibility of maintaining a 3% inflation level temporarily, whereas the second text focuses on the determination to return to 2% inflation and the specific mechanisms to achieve that.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""real rates,"" ""cooling,"" and ""excess demand,"" which emphasize economic dynamics and conditions, while the second text uses terms like ""maximum employment"" and ""cumulative tightening,"" emphasizing policy frameworks and goals.
2. The second text includes specific references to monetary policy actions and decisions, such as ""federal funds rate"" and ""primary credit rate,"" which are not mentioned in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias, evident in its language about labor market conditions. Phrases such as ""these are very positive developments"" and ""it really is different"" convey a sense of optimism regarding labor supply and job openings, suggesting confidence in the economic situation moving forward. In contrast, the second text's phrasing, which includes ""Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity,"" introduces a more cautious and slightly negative viewpoint. While both texts maintain a generally neutral tone, the first text’s references to ""strong labor market"" and the acknowledgment of “positive developments” give it a more optimistic outlook.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text communicates a higher level of certainty through assertive language, such as “I think we may not be far off or possibly even at that level,” and “I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different.” These phrases indicate confidence and a degree of assurance about the future economic conditions. On the other hand, the second text expresses moderate certainty with phrases like ""The Committee will closely monitor incoming information,"" which suggests an ongoing assessment rather than a definitive stance. The language used in the second text introduces some hesitancy regarding outcomes, indicating that while there is commitment to returning inflation to 2 percent, external factors are acknowledged.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: real rates, QT, dual mandate, 50-year low unemployment, wage increases
2. Second Text: streak of 10 rate hikes, hawkish tone, economic picture, uncomfortable level, credit markets

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the actions and effects of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies in relation to inflation.
2. Both texts acknowledge the persistence of inflation above the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the implications of labor markets and employment statistics in relation to inflation, while the second text emphasizes the overall economic risks and potential for a recession due to monetary policy.
2. The first text adopts a more optimistic tone regarding the possibility of avoiding a recession, while the second text expresses concern about the potential economic slowdown and its consequences.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text elaborates in detail on labor market conditions, including job openings and wage movements, whereas the second text focuses more on the broader economic impacts of rate hikes and inflation.
2. The first text provides qualitative insights into the Federal Reserve's outlook, while the second text includes specific market predictions and the potential need for further rate adjustments.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses phrases like ""tight policy"" and ""prolonged 3% inflation,"" while the second refers to ""pausing rate increases"" and ""sticky inflation.""
2. The first text mentions ""excess demand in the labor market,"" whereas the second highlights the ""tendency for rate cuts"" and ""banking sector crisis.""","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a slightly more positive sentiment, particularly in the way it discusses the labor market and the potential for maintaining employment levels despite inflationary pressures. Phrases such as ""these are very positive developments"" highlight an optimistic view on labor supply, compared to the second text, which presents a more cautionary tone with phrases like ""Economists worry, though, about whether the Fed’s streak of 10 rate hikes... will eventually cause the economy to slow too much and cause a recession."" The first text conveys an underlying sense of hope and possibility in its outlook on economic conditions, whereas the second text points prominently to risks and concerns regarding future economic stability.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text reflects a lower level of certainty overall. For instance, the repeated use of ""I think,"" ""it seems to me,"" and ""we're looking for"" in the first text indicates a tentative stance on predictions about rates and inflation, suggesting the speaker is acknowledging potential uncertainties in the economic landscape. Contrastingly, the second text employs more definitive language, such as ""the consensus view"" and ""the big question is whether,"" which conveys a higher level of certainty regarding economists' analyses and expectations for future Fed actions.

And now we have credit conditions tightening, not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more due to what's happened. And we have to factor all of that in and make our assessment of whether our policy stands as sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable legs. So this is challenging. But we will make our best assessment, and that's what we're thinking. What about the idea of rate cuts? Yeah, so we on the committee have a view that inflation is going to come down not so quickly, but it will take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates and we won't cut rates. If you have a different forecast, markets have been from time to time pricing and quite rapid reductions in inflation. We'd factor that in, but that's not our forecast. And of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down. Particularly now, if you look at non-housing services, it really hasn't moved much. And it's quite stable. So we think we'll have to demand, we'll have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And again, in that world, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to cut rates. Courtney? Courtney Brown from Axios. I'm curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you think it's contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits? And did the committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. It's really not contributing. We don't think now it hasn't actually been growing. We moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the, when there were the big deposit flows, which by the way have really stabilized now, what happened was institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the federal home loan banks and things like that. Over the course of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradually, as they do in every tightening cycle. They've been gradually moving their deposits into higher yielding places such as CDs and other things, including money market funds. So that's a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a tightening cycle. What was unusual really was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around things like that. But it doesn't seem to have had any effect overall over the overnight repositility. That is really there to help us keep rates where they're supposed to be, and it's soaring that purpose very well. Sarah. Sarah, you all waste CBS news. I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets and borrowing? Yeah, I would just say it's, I don't really think we should be, we shouldn't even be talking about a world in which the US doesn't pay its bills. It just shouldn't be a thing. And again, I would just say we don't, no one should assume that the Fed can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from the damage that such an event might inflict. Scott. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last week, Vice Chair Bard identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the regulatory, or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank. A policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny. And also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019, do you share that view and what would it take to get the stronger oversight that you and he said it and your release would be necessary? So I didn't take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do, I have read it of course and I find it persuasive.

 WASHINGTON (AP) — Poised to raise interest rates Wednesday for a 10th time, Federal Reserve officials are facing two competing economic trends that could make their future rate decisions more difficult and treacherous..The central bank wants to dampen Wall Street’s animal spirits and crimp demand for goods and services so inflation returns to a more manageable level and stays there..""We believe that continuing to raise interest rates would be an abandonment of the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve both maximum employment and price stability and show little regard for the small businesses and working families that will get caught in the wreckage,” they wrote..The big question is whether the Fed will also signal Wednesday that it’s now inclined to pause its rate increases – barring any reacceleration of inflation – and keep its key rate unchanged for the rest of 2023 as it assesses its progress in cooling inflation..But particularly if political battles around the debt ceiling worsen, the economy could fall into a deep enough recession that the Fed might be forced to cut interest rates some time this year – even if inflation isn’t fully in check..Economists state that after this hike, the FOMC might take a pause and ease up on its monetary policies keeping in mind the banking sector crisis..While equity markets have been jittery this week due to the US banking sector crisis, a pause in rate hikes is not baked into equity markets, according to the analysts at JP Morgan.It will be the tenth rate hike by the FOMC since March 2022, taking the interest rate to 5.25%.Elevated inflation has made the FOMC’s job difficult amidst growing calls by US lawmakers to pause rate hikes, including the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Pramila Jayapaul, who called on the US Fed to “avoid engineering a recession that destroys jobs and crushes small businesses”.Despite this, the broader consensus is that the FOMC may still deliver a 25 bps rate hike before taking a pause.“Even as regional banking sector stress remains in place that is visible in the credit markets, we expect the FOMC to move forward and deliver its final rate hike of 25 bps in the current cycle,” said a report by ICICI Bank.This will take the interest rate to 5.25%, and the total quantum of hikes to 500 basis points since March last year.“We expect the forward guidance to change to indicate that the central bank is moving to a prolonged pause as it waits to assess the lagged effect of monetary tightening,” the ICICI Bank report added.Recent macroeconomic developments in the US have made the FOMC’s job difficult as far as the monetary policy direction is concerned..ING expects rate cuts to begin as soon as November this year.Analysts at Nomura also note that a 25 bps hike is likely on Wednesday, but going forward, the monetary policy tightening could come to an end.“There appears to have been uptake in emergency borrowings at the San Francisco Fed region, even after adjusting for the impact of quantitative tightening, which might be related to continued news of stress at the First Republic Bank,” the brokerage said, adding that it expects rate cuts to start in March 2024.All in all, the consensus is that the FOMC is highly likely to deliver one last 25 bps rate hike today while keeping a close watch on inflation..Rate cuts could begin later this year, but until then, economists expect gradual easing up of monetary policies..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 p.m, and the post-meeting statement, will offer clues on whether additional rate increases are likely in the months ahead, and how credit conditions have shaped up in the seven weeks since the first bank failure..A coming credit crunch?.“So if you’re at the Fed and you’re trying to slow the economy, you don’t want the financial system to crash, but it’s OK with you if banks lend a little less, and then you raise interest rates a little less, and that’s why they’ll probably stop after one or two more rate hikes.”
 Tighter credit conditions help the Fed curb demand to bring down inflation..""Strains in the banking sector continue to cause headaches at the Fed, while the Treasury worries about the debt limit,"" SocGen's Kit Juckes wrote..""Strategically if the Fed doesn’t want markets to price in cuts, it should send a message that a pause could be followed by hikes as well as cuts if that is what the data say – as it stands the market only sees one way risk once there is a pause."".If that happens, the focus will be on whether or how hard Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back on investors' expectations for rate cuts by year's end..""We expect the Committee to signal that it anticipates pausing in June but retains a hawkish bias, stopping earlier than it initially envisioned because bank stress is likely to cause a tightening of credit."".We also heard from the Bank of Korea's governor — who said it's 'premature' to talk about rate cuts just yet — but noted global central banks near the end of their tightening cycles..The move was widely expected, and it’s supposed to slow the economy further in hopes of getting inflation under control..The central bank may have given a nod toward the possibility in its statement, where it dropped a reference saying it ""anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.”
 But it stopped short of declaring the end to rate hikes, which have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking system and sent stock prices well below their record heights..""Unless and until the Fed were to see actual strains on the banking sector, we believe it will stick with its stated view from the March meeting that U.S. banks remain sound and resilient."".""Higher-for-longer rates are likely to pose a significant headwind to bank earnings per share/return on equity given margin pressures, slowing growth and worsening credit risk."".If the Fed continues to raise rates and doesn't pause, that is only going to create a bigger problem because most of these regional banks are suffering because of the higher rate structure."".“Even if this proves to be the final Fed rate hike, interest rates are still high and will remain that way.”
 What’s happening with credit cards?.Chair Jerome Powell had said in March that a cutback in lending by banks, to shore up their finances, could act as the equivalent of a quarter-point rate hike in slowing the economy..Fed economists have estimated that tighter credit resulting from the bank failures will contribute to a “mild recession” later this year, thereby raising the pressure on the central bank to suspend its rate hikes..If that happens, focus will be on whether or how hard Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back on investors' expectations for rate cuts by year's end.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

The first text demonstrates a moderate certainty level, as seen in phrases like ""we will make our best assessment"" and ""if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate to cut rates,"" which indicate a confidence in prediction while acknowledging complexities. The second text also reflects this moderate certainty with phrases such as ""is the consensus view of today’s Fed meeting"" and ""we expect the Committee to signal,"" showing that the authors express confidence in their assessments while still recognizing uncertainties in the economic landscape.

I think the only thing that I'm really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is, it may just have been technology evolving, we have to keep up with all that, but some of it may be our policies and supervisor and regulatory, whatever. Well, what our job is now is identify those things and implement them. And that's kind of the only thing I care about is, and I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. Can I add that? Thank you, Evan Reiser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking terminal among regional banks? And secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying? So, I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks really from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved and all the deposits have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of first republic kind of draws a line under that period of, is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of severe stress, okay? I also think we are very focused on what's happening with credit availability, particularly with what you saw in the beige book and you will see in the sleuths is medium size, small and small, small, medium size banks are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards, build liquidity. What's going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we will continue to very carefully monitor what's going on in the banking system and will factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way going forward. Great. Thank you, Frit Chairman. Great grab from MarketWatch. I just wondered if you've done any reflection on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last, since you've been Frit Chairman. I think I've heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the vice chair for supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go about this and comments on that, thank you. Sure, so let me say first of all, I've been chair of the board for five plus years now and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we've learned some new things as well and we need to do better. And as I mentioned, I thought the report was on flinching inappropriately. So I welcome it and I agree with and we'll support those recommendations and I do feel that I'm personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So on the vice chair for supervision, the place to start is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The vice chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations develop policy recommendations for the board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution companies and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms. So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the board, not the chair, as vice chair for supervision, who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the board of governors. Congress wanted that person to be, to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it works, the way it has worked in practice for me is I've had a good working relationship. I give my council my input privately and I offer that and I have good conversations and I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with vice chair bar and as predecessor. And I think that's the way it's supposed to work and that's appropriate. I believe that's what the law requires. And I wouldn't say it's a matter of complete deference. It's more I have a role in presenting my views and discussing having an intelligent discussion about what's going on and why. And that's my point.",-0.0024096972057247,18,2023-05-03,True,False,False,False,"The Committee will closely monitor

2. Each text addresses the role of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the banking system and making decisions affecting monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the immediate crisis and accountability within the banking system, focusing on past mistakes and future measures for improvement.
2. The second text maintains a more general and optimistic tone regarding the resilience of the banking system and focuses on broader monetary policy strategies rather than specific events.

Variations in Detail/Scope:

Additionally, the speaker reflects on past mistakes with phrases like ""I fully recognize that we made mistakes"" and ""we need to do better,"" which indicate a somewhat pessimistic tone regarding the current situation. In contrast, the second text begins with a slightly more positive assertion, stating that ""The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient,"" suggesting stability and confidence in the system. The use of terms like ""closely monitor"" and ""prepared to adjust"" in the second text reinforces a more proactive and neutral stance as opposed to the reactive nature of the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

My colleagues and I are acutely aware that a high inflation imposes hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by five percentage points. We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, especially housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. In light of how far we've come in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and potential headwinds from credit tightening. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5 and a quarter percent, and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. As I noted earlier, nearly all committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year. But at this meeting, considering how far and how fast we've moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range steady to allow the committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy forming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In our SEP, participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. If the economy evolves, as projected, the median participant projects at the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6% at the end of this year. 4.6% at the end of 2024, and 3.4% at the end of 2025. For the end of this year, the median projection is a half percentage point higher than in our March projections. By hastened to add, as always, that these projections are not a committee decision or plan. If the economy does not evolve as projected, path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal, and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do at the Fed is in service to our public mission. We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Colby. Thank you, Colby Smith, with the Financial Times. I'm curious what gives you in the committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated, interest rate sensitive sectors like housing, while they felt the drag of the past Fed actions have started to recover in some regions, and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing. So I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that. So as we started our rate hikes early last year, we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence. And that of the speed of tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then in a period of time over which we need to keep policy restrictive. So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how fast to move rates up and we moved very quickly by historical standards.

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on June 14, 2023
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.15 percent, effective June 15, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive
 Effective June 15, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 5 to 5-14 percent.","The 18 committee members appear split between those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is for at least a few months and see whether inflation further moderates..The Fed’s goal is to achieve the delicate task of slowing borrowing and spending enough to cool growth and tame inflation, without derailing the economy in the process..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 The Federal Reserve’s likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation..“That might mean the Fed is going to have to hold rates higher for longer, and it may even mean boosting rates further in the months ahead,” McBride said..For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, ""gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”
 ___
 AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report..By making it more expensive to borrow and invest, the Fed has been working to slow the overall demand in the economy and thus reduce upward price pressure..That’s a big deal to Fed officials who have spoken publicly about their fears of a wage-price spiral — the feedback loop that drives inflation higher as people make more money and go out and spend it..During the Fed policy meeting in May, participants expressed worry that even though the pace of wage growth has been gradually slowing, it’s still “running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over the longer run with the Committee’s 2% inflation objective,” according to minutes from the meeting..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”
 Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the Cboe Volatility Index — dropped back below 15, against an average of 23 for the past year, underscoring support for risk assets..Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek
 ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.
 
 
 Something of a neutral report on consumer-level inflation in the U.S. economy should give the Federal Reserve reason to pump the brakes on additional rate hikes for now, analysts said Tuesday..The Fed has battled high inflation for the better part of a year with successive rate hikes that are designed to make borrowing prohibitive enough to dampen demand and pull consumer-level prices lower..The Fed is presented with a careful balancing act with rate hikes, trying to both cool the economy and avoid a recession that would see widespread layoffs..It’s attempting the excruciating balancing act of slowing the economy just enough through rate increases to snuff out high inflation, but not so much as to break the job market and create a recession..Greedflation may force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates “higher for longer” to fight inflation, pushing the economy into recession..“Analysts reveling in companies’ higher margins at the micro level have not realized the macroeconomic implications of greedflation,” he wrote on Wednesday, explaining that rising profits have driven inflation “higher for longer,” which, in turn, will force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates elevated “and hence the coming recession will be deeper for longer.”
 For over a year now Wall Street economists have warned that rising interest rates will eventually bring the economy to a standstill and spark a recession, but so far their predictions have proved—at the very least—to be premature..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a ""hawkish skip.""","Tighter credit conditions for households

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve, having raised interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades, is poised Wednesday to leave rates alone for the first time in 15 months to allow time to gauge the impact of its aggressive drive to tame inflation..The 18 committee members appear split between those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is for at least a few months and see whether inflation further moderates..The Fed’s goal is to achieve the delicate task of slowing borrowing and spending enough to cool growth and tame inflation, without derailing the economy in the process..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 The Federal Reserve’s likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation..“That might mean the Fed is going to have to hold rates higher for longer, and it may even mean boosting rates further in the months ahead,” McBride said..For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, ""gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. central bank kicked off a historically aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in March of 2022..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”

This is evident in phrases where the speaker emphasizes commitment to goals, such as ""we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective"" and ""we will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals."" These expressions convey a sense of actionable optimism and dedication that is less pronounced in the second text, which primarily states, ""The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run,"" a comparatively more matter-of-fact and less impassioned statement.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: Higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses higher certainty in its assertions and plans compared to the second text. The phrase ""we have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening"" indicates confidence in observing the results of their actions, which contrasts with the second text's ""are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,"" expressing a less definitive stance. Additionally, the first text mentions ""nearly all committee participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further,"" clearly stating expectations, while the second text uses qualifying language with ""would be prepared to adjust"" which suggests a more tentative approach.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: maximum employment, stable prices, policy tightening, cumulative tightening
2. Second Text: hawkish skip, greedflation, interest rate hikes, gauge the impact

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's interest rates and its impact on inflation.
2. Each text emphasizes the delicate balance the Federal Reserve must maintain between controlling inflation and sustaining economic growth.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the deliberate and cautious approach of the Federal Reserve regarding monetary policy, portraying a formal tone and in-depth analysis of projections and decision-making processes.
2. The second text adopts a more immediate, journalistic style, concentrating on the latest developments regarding rates and public sentiment, with a tone suggesting urgency and speculation about future moves.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a comprehensive examination of the Federal Reserve's actions and the rationale behind maintaining interest rates, including projected numbers for future rates.
2. The second text highlights specific terms like ""hawkish skip"" and ""greedflation,"" emphasizing ongoing concerns about inflation while presenting less detailed projections.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""softening of labor market conditions"" and ""longer-term inflation expectations,"" which are more quantitative and technical.
2. The second text includes phrases such as ""hawkish skip"" and ""greedflation,"" which are more casual and indicative of ongoing market trends and sentiments.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a commitment to achieving economic stability, reflecting an emotionally positive stance toward the potential for recovery and effective monetary policy. Phrases like ""we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective"" and ""we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country"" illustrate an active and optimistic engagement with the challenges faced. In contrast, the second text has a slightly more cautious tone, with phrases such as ""the Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation"" and ""greedflation may force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer,"" which indicate a focus on potential negative outcomes and a more pessimistic perspective on economic conditions.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a higher level of certainty regarding the Fed's actions and their anticipated outcomes. For instance, statements like ""we remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal"" clearly express confidence in the Fed’s ability to meet its targets. In contrast, the second text conveys a more uncertain stance, illustrated by phrases such as ""those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is"" and ""a careful balancing act with rate hikes,"" indicating a lack of consensus and a degree of hesitation about future actions. This suggests that the first text is more assertive in its declarations and commitments compared to the second, which is more exploratory and cautious."
2023-06-14 18:40:00,2023-06-14 18:45:00," consecutive 75 basis point hikes we moderated to a pace of 50 basis point hikes and then this year to 325 basis point hikes at sequential meetings. So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination. So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rate steady at this meeting, I would just say it's a continuation of that process. The main issue that we're focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time. So the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables. Given how far we have come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace. I want to stress one more thing and that is that the committee decision made today was only about this meeting. We didn't make any decision about going forward including what would happen at the next meeting including we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every other meeting kind of an approach or really any other approach. We really were focused on what to do at this meeting. So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move. So again we didn't we didn't make a decision about July. I mean of course it came up in the meeting from time to time but really the focus was on what to do today. I would say about July two things. One decision hasn't been made to. I do expect that it will be a live meeting. Thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters. I wish this morning if you could help us understand the narrative here because it feels like there's been a level shift in the dots. Stronger GDP less of a hit on employment, slower progress on inflation and I'm wondering in this sort of where's the disinflation coming from? The labor market is going to be stronger. It looks like it's not coming from there. Demand is not coming down all that fast according to GDP. You've doubled your estimate of GDP. So what's the narrative here? It seems like it's getting more immaculate rather than more messy. So you're right that the data came in I would say consistent with but on the high side of expectations. So and if you go back to the former SEP, the last SEP in March you will see that growth moved up. These are not huge moves but growth estimates moved up a bit unemployment estimates moved down a bit. Inflation estimates moved up to bit and you know the all three of those kind of point in the same direction which is you know that perhaps more restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting. So although the level frankly is pretty the level of 5.6 is pretty consistent if you think about it where the federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March. So but so we've kind of gone back to that. So your question is where is the disinflation going to come from? And you know I don't think the story has really changed. We the committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one. It's going to take some time. And I think you go back to the to the three-part framework for core PC inflation which is we think as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward. You start with goods with goods we need to see continued healing and supply conditions, supply side conditions. They've definitely improved a substantial amount but if you talk to people in business they will say it's not back to where it was. So that's that's one thing and that should enable goods prices to continue because inflation to continue to come down over time. In terms of housing services inflation that's another big piece and you are seeing there that new rents new leases are coming in at low levels and it's really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline. In fact I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose of this year and next year will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source and that's again probably going to come slower than we would affect. That leaves you know the big sector which is a little more than half part of the core PC inflation that's not housing services and you know we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there. It's a sector it's a very broad and diverse sector I would say in a number of the parts of that sector the largest cost would be wage costs. It's a service sector so it's heavily labor intensive and I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions which we have seen. We have actually seen you know go through a number of indicators suggesting there's been some loosening in labor market conditions we need to see that continue. I would almost say that the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down are",0.0030330185427724,20,2023-06-14,True,True,False,False,"Holding the target range steady at

 NEW YORK – The Federal Reserve's likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation..For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, ""gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. central bank kicked off a historically aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in March of 2022..Policy-makers at the end of their two-day meeting may well signal more rate increases are still to come once they take time to assess how the economy is evolving, whether the financial system remains stable, and if inflation is continuing to fall..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”

I will say that July meeting will be live. And we'll just have to see. I think you'll see the data. You'll hear fed people talking about it and markets will have to make a judgment. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement? Or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to know what's happening? I think if you look at, if you just look at, I'll just point you to the forecast. So inflation is running. Core PCU's inflation is running at about 4 1,5, a little higher than 4 1,5%. And the median FOMC participant thinks it'll go down to 3.9 on a 12-month basis. This is by the end of this year. So that's expecting pretty substantial progress. That's a pretty significant decline for half a year. So that's the forecast. We do try to be transparent in our reaction function. We're committed to getting inflation down. And that's the number one thing. So that's how I think about it. It's going to Victoria. Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk about the balance sheet and how you're thinking about it? What are you looking for to judge whether we're approaching reserve scarcity and is treasury issue and going to affect that also are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks? So let me say first of all, on the treasury part of it, if I can talk about that, and then go back to the balance sheet. So on that, of course, we've been very focused on that for a couple of months. As everyone has, treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly. I think we all saw. I saw the Secretary's comments yesterday to the effect that treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid market disruption and that they're going to watch carefully for that. So that's from the treasury, which actually sets the borrowings. At the Fed, we'll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the treasury refills the TGA. The adjustment process is very likely to involve both the reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves. It's really hard to say at the beginning of this, which will be greater. We are starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated RRP to take up for that matter. So we don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term, or even over the course of the year. So that's the treasury part of the answer. We will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we're prepared to make adjustments to make sure that monetary policy transmission works. Was there another part of your question? Yeah. Are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off banks? So we have a number of, I would say, the RRP doesn't look like it's pulling money out of the banking system. It's actually been shrinking here lately. So I don't think that's not something we've thought about a lot over time. It doesn't really look like that's something that we would do. I think it's a tool that we have. If we want to use it, we can. There are other tools we can use to address money market issues. But I wouldn't say that that's something that's likely that we would do in the near term. I'll go. Janelle Marte with Bloomberg. Have you seen sufficient cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down? For example, how does the recent rebound affect your forecast? And how does it factor into monetary policy? So certainly housing, very interest-sensitive. And it's the first place, really, or one of the first places that's either helped by lower rates or that is held back by higher rates. And we certainly saw that over the course of the last year. We now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit. We're watching that situation carefully. I do think we will see rents and house prices filtering into housing services inflation. And I don't see them coming up quickly. I do see them kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now. And that's appropriate. Do you think you'll have to target with further rate increases? Well, I think we look at everything. We don't just look at housing. So I think the way it works is individual participants sit in their offices all over the country and they write down their forecast. And including their most likely forecast, including their rate forecast. And then they send it in on Friday afternoon.

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. central bank kicked off a historically aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in March of 2022..“We probably need a little more tightening, but it is not clear how much,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist in the fixed income division at T. Rowe Price Associates, noting that despite strength in recent employment and core inflation reports, a “nuanced” reading of the data showed both may be set to weaken..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..watch now
 However, the post-meeting statement could be massaged in a way that markets don't assume that policymakers have gone quiescent on inflation and are set on halting the rate-hiking cycle..The Fed’s post-meeting statement confirmed that officials deem the pause a prudent move, but most officials think additional hikes are necessary this year, according to the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”
 Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the Cboe Volatility Index — dropped back below 15, against an average of 23 for the past year, underscoring support for risk assets..The Fed is presented with a careful balancing act with rate hikes, trying to both cool the economy and avoid a recession that would see widespread layoffs..It’s attempting the excruciating balancing act of slowing the economy just enough through rate increases to snuff out high inflation, but not so much as to break the job market and create a recession..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a ""hawkish skip."".""The soft inflation report effectively cements a Fed pause, although I doubt it will be enough to warrant a dovish undertone as it's not in their interest with CPI twice the Fed's target,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, who points to 103 as a key support level for the dollar index.","Inflation remains elevated..Holding the target range steady at

 The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. central bank kicked off a historically aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in March of 2022..“We probably need a little more tightening, but it is not clear how much,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist in the fixed income division at T. Rowe Price Associates, noting that despite strength in recent employment and core inflation reports, a “nuanced” reading of the data showed both may be set to weaken..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..watch now
 However, the post-meeting statement could be massaged in a way that markets don't assume that policymakers have gone quiescent on inflation and are set on halting the rate-hiking cycle..The Fed’s post-meeting statement confirmed that officials deem the pause a prudent move, but most officials think additional hikes are necessary this year, according to the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”
 Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the Cboe Volatility Index — dropped back below 15, against an average of 23 for the past year, underscoring support for risk assets..The Fed is presented with a careful balancing act with rate hikes, trying to both cool the economy and avoid a recession that would see widespread layoffs..It’s attempting the excruciating balancing act of slowing the economy just enough through rate increases to snuff out high inflation, but not so much as to break the job market and create a recession..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a ""hawkish skip."".While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00%-5.25% range, Fed policymakers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The Fed's last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined - movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..""The soft inflation report effectively cements a Fed pause, although I doubt it will be enough to warrant a dovish undertone as it's not in their interest with CPI twice the Fed's target,"" said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index, who points to 103 as a key support level for the dollar index.","Inflation remains elevated..Tighter credit conditions for households

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a sense of optimism regarding the Federal Reserve's efforts to tackle inflation and the upcoming meetings. Phrases such as ""we're committed to getting inflation down"" and ""that's expecting pretty substantial progress"" illustrate a positive outlook on the Fed's monetary policy efforts. In contrast, the second text uses terms like ""uncertainty"" and ""caution about the economy,"" suggesting a less optimistic perspective on the Fed's situation, despite acknowledging that rate hikes have had some success. The emphasis on potential further rate increases and fears of a recession in the second text adds a slightly more negative undertone to its analysis.

The second text mentions ""the expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty,"" indicating that there are known dynamics at play but with a mixed outlook. Thus, while both texts acknowledge the complexities and potential uncertainties in the Fed's outlook, they maintain a level of certainty regarding the Fed's direction and strategies, making their certainty levels similar."

Well, I don't know that housing is itself going to be driving the rates picture, but it's part of it. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to go back to comments you made about in the past, about unsustainable fiscal path. The CBO projects the federal deficit to be 2.8 trillion in 10 years. The CBO also says that federal debt will be 52 trillion by 2033. At what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility? Because I'm assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher level spending? I don't do that. That's really not my job. We hope and expect that other policymakers will respect our independence on monetary policy. And we don't see ourselves as the judges of appropriate fiscal policy. I will say, and many of my predecessors have said that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path, and that needs to be addressed over time. But I think trying to get into that with lawmakers would be inappropriate given our independence and our need to stick to our netting. Is there any conversation then about the federal's financing some of that debt that we're seeing come not the pike? No. Under no circumstances. Courtney. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. So looking at the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly, or forecast for GDP this year. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward. And so should we take that as a sign that the committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing, at least as it relates to what you're expecting in March? You know, I would just say it this way. I continue to think, and this really hasn't changed, that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment that we've seen in so many past instances. It's possible in a way a strong labor market is that gradually cools, could aid that along. It could aid that along. But I guess I want to come back to the main thing, which is, though, simply this, we see the committee, as you can see from the SEP, the committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2%. And we'll do whatever it takes to get it down to 2% over time. That is our plan. And we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the US economy is the thing that we cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today's workers and families and businesses, but also for the future. Getting price stability back and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it's sustained. And it really is the bedrock of the economy. And you should understand that that is our top priority. Just a quick follow-up on that. I'm just a little confused because you said the committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time. But when I look at the SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year. But the Fed funds rate is lower than where it is now. Can you help me understand that? Sure. So if you look two and three years out with the forecast, first of all, I wouldn't put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they're so highly uncertain. But what they're showing is that as inflation comes down in the forecast, if you don't lower interest rates, then real rates are actually going up. So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point two years out, let's say, should come down just to maintain real rates. And actually, since we're probably going to have to be meaningfully positive and significantly, so for us to get inflation down, that probably means that that certainly means that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly. And again, we're talking about a couple years out. I think as anyone can see, not a single person on the committee wrote down a rate cut this year. Nor do I think it is all likely to be appropriate. If you think about it, inflation has not really moved down. It is not so far reacted much to our existing rate hikes. And so we're going to have to keep that. Julie. I'm Rachel for our Jewish Abedist, anything? I'm Michael Scott. I'm sorry.",0.002724234238359,22,2023-06-14,True,True,False,False,"Holding the target range steady at

 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 The Federal Reserve’s likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation..“It just means they may be willing to hold rates where they are and let the economy continue to settle without more rate-related prodding in the immediate future.”
 If the economy does cool, Channel predicts that mortgage rates may end the year closer to 6% than to 7%..During the Fed policy meeting in May, participants expressed worry that even though the pace of wage growth has been gradually slowing, it’s still “running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over the longer run with the Committee’s 2% inflation objective,” according to minutes from the meeting..A sense of caution about the economy competing with ongoing inflation concerns has led the Fed to this point, on the verge of what analysts are calling a “hawkish skip.”
 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference after the release of U.S. Fed policy decision on interest rates, in Washington, May 3, 2023..Communication from the Fed, then, likely will be, ""We're not convinced that this is the end of the rate hikes, but we want to take a look around see what kind of damage the banking crisis has inflicted on the economy,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”

 While likely to forego an increase in borrowing costs after 10 consecutive hikes that have pushed the benchmark overnight interest rate to the current 5.00 per cent-5.25 per cent range, Fed policy-makers at the same time are expected to show both in their language and projections that one or perhaps two more quarter-percentage-point hikes will still be needed by the end of 2023..The expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty around what it all means, with those Fed officials worried the economy may weaken fast getting at least a six-week timeout until the July 25-26 meeting, and those concerned about still-high inflation readings knowing the central bank will remain primed to move rates higher if price pressures do not relent..The Fed’s last set of quarterly projections anticipated the benchmark overnight interest rate would only move down by the end of 2024 as inflation also declined – movements that keep the inflation-adjusted rate of interest roughly the same..Market participants expect the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to pause interest rate hikes because of uncertainty over the economic outlook and the lagged effects of 10 rate increases since March 2022..Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell holds a news conference after the release of U.S. Fed policy decision on interest rates, in Washington, May 3, 2023..Communication from the Fed, then, likely will be, ""We're not convinced that this is the end of the rate hikes, but we want to take a look around see what kind of damage the banking crisis has inflicted on the economy,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics..“Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down 2% over time,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference..“The Fed is putting more weight on the strong jobs data and sticky core inflation than the slowing headline inflation numbers and is clearly trying to avoid a 1970s style resurgence in inflation,” wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an analyst note..“The Fed had to do something to knock market optimism today, otherwise it risks a tougher inflation fight and deeper economic woes down the line.”
 Although the Fed thinks additional policy action is necessary to successfully tamp down inflation, Powell said he’s optimistic about inflation cooling further because of slowing shelter costs, which make up more than 40% of the Consumer Price Index’s core measure..“I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will contain a big dose — this year or next year — will contain a good amount of disinflation from that source.”
 Tighter access to credit
 Officials are also keeping a close watch on how credit conditions shape up, considering some lingering stress in the regional banking sector..“The economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity and inflation,” Powell said..Economists say the July meeting will be a close call and Powell said in his presser that officials will examine “a three-month period of data” for that decision..“We expect Powell will follow up with a relatively hawkish tone in the press conference in order to prevent a dovish market reaction, stressing that inflation is still too high and the Fed will be resolute in returning inflation to target.”

 Thats when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates after jacking them to their highest levels since 2007 in hopes of getting high inflation under control.The wide expectation on Wall Street is that the Fed will make no move, which would be the first time in more than a year where it hasnt raised rates..That's when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates after jacking them to their highest levels since 2007 in hopes of getting high inflation under control..She said that while easing inflation data ""reduces the risk that the Fed may have to keep hiking into the 6% range, the data is not enough to conclude that the Fed will ease anytime soon."".Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other top policymakers have also indicated that they want to assess how much a pullback in bank lending might be weakening the economy..For the Fed, “skipping” a rate hike at this week’s meeting may be the most effective way for Powell to unite a fractious policymaking committee..The 18 committee members appear split between those who favor one or two more rate hikes and those who would like to leave the Fed’s key rate where it is for at least a few months and see whether inflation further moderates..On Wednesday, Fed officials will also update their quarterly economic projections, including a forecast of what their key rate will be at year’s end..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“Overall, the inflation data support a hold in policy at today’s (Fed) meeting.’’
 
 
 The Federal Reserve’s likely decision Wednesday afternoon to leave interest rates alone for the first time in 11 meetings will raise hopes that it may be nearing the end of its rate-hiking campaign to cool inflation..“That might mean the Fed is going to have to hold rates higher for longer, and it may even mean boosting rates further in the months ahead,” McBride said..“It just means they may be willing to hold rates where they are and let the economy continue to settle without more rate-related prodding in the immediate future.”
 If the economy does cool, Channel predicts that mortgage rates may end the year closer to 6% than to 7%..For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, ""gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”
 ___
 AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report..During the Fed policy meeting in May, participants expressed worry that even though the pace of wage growth has been gradually slowing, it’s still “running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over the longer run with the Committee’s 2% inflation objective,” according to minutes from the meeting..Federal Reserve policy-makers at the end of their two-day meeting may well signal more rate increases are still to come once they take time to assess how the economy is evolving

1. First Text: unsustainable fiscal path, soft landing, price stability, GDP forecast, federal deficit
2. Second Text: maximum employment, target range, policy firming, cumulative tightening, federal funds rate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's focus on controlling inflation and maintaining economic stability.
2. Both texts reference the importance of monetary policy in relation to employment and inflation.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the need for fiscal responsibility alongside monetary policy, while the second text primarily focuses on the implementation of monetary policy without referencing fiscal policy.
2. The first text presents a more conversational tone with a Q&A structure, while the second text is more formal and structured, resembling a policy announcement.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text discusses projections regarding federal deficit and debt, offering specific numbers and timelines, while the second text lacks such detailed fiscal projections and focuses instead on monetary policy actions.
2. The first text includes individual inquiry and commentary from reporters, while the second text provides formal policy updates and decisions made by the Federal Reserve.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""unsustainable fiscal path"" and ""soft landing,"" which are absent in the second text, which opts for terminology like ""maximum employment"" and ""policy firming.""
2. The second text includes technical terms related to monetary operations such as ""open market operations"" and ""agency mortgage-backed securities,"" which do not appear in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias, particularly through the optimistic phrasing regarding the potential for a “path to getting inflation back down to 2%” without a “sharp downturn and large losses of employment.” This suggests a belief in a favorable outcome, which contrasts with the second text that discusses tighter credit conditions having potentially negative ramifications for economic activities. While the second text remains factual and neutral in tone, mentioning the elevated inflation and potential risks, it lacks the hopeful nuance found in the first text. The use of phrases like “we see the committee… unified in the need to get inflation down to 2%” reflects a deeper sense of collective determination and positive outlook in the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty, as seen in the phrase “I wouldn’t put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they’re so highly uncertain.” This admission of uncertainty conveys hesitance, ultimately leading to a more cautious tone regarding future economic conditions. Conversely, the second text maintains a higher degree of certainty by stating, ""the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy."" It clearly outlines strategic approaches and decisions that the Committee is prepared to implement, which gives it a more assured tone. The structured format of the second text and its definitive policy statements contrast with the more contemplative nature of the first text, which questions the strength of forecasts, thereby indicating lower certainty.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: unsustainable fiscal path, projecting federal deficit, inflation at 2%, monetary policy independence
2. Second Text: hawkish skip, pause in rate hikes, borrowing costs, credit conditions shaping economy

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and their relationship with inflation. 
2. Both texts emphasize the importance of controlling inflation and the risks associated with high inflation levels.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text has a tone focused on the complexities of fiscal responsibility and independence of monetary policy, while the second text emphasizes the potential outcomes and strategies surrounding interest rate decisions.
2. The second text discusses market expectations and reactions to upcoming Fed announcements, while the first text is more focused on the Fed's internal discussions and projections.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text includes discussions about fiscal responsibility and the federal deficit, providing a broader economic context, while the second text primarily concentrates on the immediate approach to interest rate decisions.
2. The second text elaborates on the current market conditions and investor expectations specific to upcoming Fed actions, while the first text is more retrospective about policy impacts and long-term inflation targets.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""CBO projects,"" which refers to formal projections from the Congressional Budget Office, while the second text uses ""hawkish skip,"" referring to a specific strategy in monetary policy.
2. The second text mentions ""credit conditions"" and their impact on the economy, which is not discussed in the first text, focusing more on broader fiscal and monetary policy concerns.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a subtly more positive emotional bias through phrases that imply optimism and hope regarding future economic conditions. For example, the speaker mentions, ""I continue to think, and this really hasn't changed, that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2% without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment."" This suggests a potential for recovery without severe negative consequences. In contrast, the second text primarily reflects caution and concern regarding inflation and economic stability. Phrases like ""a sense of caution about the economy"" and ""the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions"" highlight a more negative sentiment and apprehension about economic conditions.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a higher level of certainty, with the speaker expressing strong confidence in the Fed's abilities and future outcomes. Phrases such as ""we see the committee... completely unified in the need to get inflation down to 2%"" and ""that is our plan"" indicate a clear and firm stance. This direct language conveys a sense of assurance in the Fed's actions. In contrast, the second text communicates moderate to low certainty, as indicated by phrases like ""uncertainty over the economic outlook"" and ""the expected policy outcome reflects a compromise born of some uncertainty."" This shows that while there are expectations, there remains some doubt and lack of assurance regarding future economic scenarios."
2023-06-14 19:10:00,2023-06-14 19:15:00," Thank you. H. Apple, Julie Schumann, AFP news agency. The major report showed a rebound in May in Black workers on employment. Is it consistent with the Fed's maximum employment mandate? Are you worried about that about this rebound? So we are, of course, worried about. There are longstanding differences in racial and ethnic groups across our labor market. That's a factor that we can't really address with our tools. But we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment, it is for us a broad and inclusive goal. And so we do watch that. But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, has been bouncing around right near historic lows, historic modern lows here. So we're still talking about, I mean, is a strong labor market, as we've seen in half century here in the United States. So overall, unemployment of 3.7% is 310 higher than it was a measure to be at the last a month ago. But still, it's extraordinarily low. And so it's a very, very tight labor market. Thank you. I want to follow up first a little bit just on the right question on housing. We heard Governor Waller talk about how we all back up. We haven't quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet. And we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there's not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how that played into today's outcome? I wouldn't say that's, you know, as a factual matter that's correct. We do need to see, you know, rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want the inflation to come down into rental is a very large part of the CPI about a third and it's about half of that for the PCE. So it's important. And so we're something that we're watching very carefully. It's part of the overall picture. I wouldn't say it's the decisive part, but take a step back. What you see is look at core inflation over the past six months year, you're just not seeing a lot of progress, not the kind of progress we want to see. And that's, it's hard to avoid that. And, you know, the committee, people in the committee, the median went up significantly so that the median participant now thinks that core PCE inflation on 12 month basis will be 3.9% this year. So once again, every year, for the past three years, it's going up over the course of the year and that's doing that again. So we see that and we see that inflation forecast are coming in low again. And do we see that that tells us that we need to do more? And so we're, that's why you see the SEP with where it is. Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and given the recent slowdown in core services, excluding housing? How far you think wages might need to fall in order to get inflation back in line? So wages will continue to increase. So we, you know, what we're talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level, but at a level that's consistent with 2% inflation over time. And so I think we've seen some progress. All of the major measures of wages have moved down from extremely elevated, not extremely, highly elevated levels a year or so ago. And they're moving back down, but quite gradually. And, you know, we want to see that process continue gradually with, of course, it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum. But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2% which benefits everyone. I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else. People on a fixed income are hurt the worst and the fastest by high inflation. Thank you so much, Chair Pograeg Robb from Marker Watch. I just wondered if the committee has talked at all about the labor market and there's strikes now and Hollywood and now the United Auto Workers are talking about a possible strike. I mean, aren't workers, we have some workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages. Does that come up in your discussions? Thanks. So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor market is about as central a topic toward discussions as anything. I mean, it's very labor economics and a labor market are utterly central. You know, it's half of our mandate. So we spend a lot of time talking about that. I think, you know, we",-0.0035272361992602,23,2023-06-14,True,True,False,False,"For release at 200 p.m. EDT June 14, 2023

 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“It just means they may be willing to hold rates where they are and let the economy continue to settle without more rate-related prodding in the immediate future.”

 After inflation cooled, investors are expecting a pause in the Federal Reserve's rate hiking campaign that has pushed interest rates to the highest level since 2007..“That might mean the Fed is going to have to hold rates higher for longer, and it may even mean boosting rates further in the months ahead,” McBride said..“It just means they may be willing to hold rates where they are and let the economy continue to settle without more rate-related prodding in the immediate future.”
 If the economy does cool, Channel predicts that mortgage rates may end the year closer to 6% than to 7%..For the Fed to leave rates alone, at least for now, ""gives them a little bit of time to evaluate the broader economic and inflationary landscape to see if further rate hikes are warranted.”

1. First Text: Black workers, core inflation, maximum employment mandate, wage increases, labor market dynamics, labor economics, inflation hurts those same people, PCE, longer-term outlook.
2. Second Text: economic activity, job gains, credit conditions, monetary policy firming, inflation expectations, Federal Reserve System, interest rate, open market operations, federal funds rate.

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss economic activity and labor market conditions.
2. Each text references inflation and its implications for the economy and monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the performance and challenges faced by specific demographic groups in the labor market, particularly Black workers, while the second text maintains a broader focus on overall economic activity and inflation.
2. The first text adopts a more conversational tone with specific inquiries about labor dynamics, whereas the second text presents a formal and structured tone typical of monetary policy announcements.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides detailed insights into labor market dynamics and wage growth, including implications for different income levels. The second text, in contrast, summarizes overall economic indicators without diving deeply into labor specifics.
2. The second text elaborates on the Federal Reserve's policies and decisions regarding monetary policy, including interest rates and open market operations, which are not mentioned in the first text.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""maximum employment mandate"" and ""Black unemployment,"" which are unique to discussions of specific employment demographics. The second text uses terms like ""credit conditions"" and ""monetary policy firming,"" which pertain to monetary policy and economic tooling.
2. The first text mentions ""labor economics"" whereas the second text makes use of ""federal funds rate"" and ""open market operations,"" highlighting differing focal points in their discussions.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: Slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text reflects a more optimistic tone compared to the second text, particularly in its discussion of the labor market and wage increases. Phrases such as ""we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment, it is for us a broad and inclusive goal"" and ""it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum"" indicate a positive outlook on employment and wages. In contrast, the second text maintains a more neutral tone with phrases like ""economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace"" and ""the extent of these effects remains uncertain,"" which do not express a clear positive bias. The first text's emphasis on strong labor markets and benefits for workers adds a subtly more positive emotional bias.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: Higher certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a higher level of certainty, especially in its analysis of the labor market, as shown in statements like ""So wages will continue to increase"" and ""we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2% which benefits everyone."" These phrases convey confidence about wage trends and their implications. On the other hand, the second text communicates a moderate level of uncertainty, illustrated by phrases such as ""the extent of these effects remains uncertain"" and ""the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information,"" suggesting that while there is ongoing assessment, clear conclusions or assurances are not fully established. Thus, the first text is more definitive in its assertions compared to the cautious language of the second text.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: maximum employment mandate, tight labor market, wage increases for lower end, core inflation persistence, wage-price spiral
2. Second Text: easing inflation data, resilient job market, wage gains, hawkish skip, greedflation

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of unemployment and the implications for wage growth and inflation.
2. They highlight the concerns of the Federal Reserve regarding inflation and employment, indicating a connection between labor market dynamics and economic policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The First Text places greater emphasis on racial disparities in the labor market and the need for inclusive policies, while the Second Text focuses more on broad economic trends and central banking decisions.
2. The First Text adopts a tone of cautious optimism about wage increases among the lower income groups, whereas the Second Text carries a more analytical tone, conveying uncertainty about future economic conditions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The First Text provides detailed insights into the implications of labor market conditions on inflation and wage growth, including a focus on racial disparities, while the Second Text discusses broader economic indicators and their alignment with Federal Reserve policies.
2. The Second Text includes a more extensive analysis of the Fed's potential policy actions in response to economic statistics, whereas the First Text centers around specific employment data without predicting policy moves.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The First Text uses terminology such as ""maximum employment mandate"" and ""core inflation persistence,"" which signals a focused discussion on labor market goals and inflation challenges.
2. The Second Text introduces terms like ""hawkish skip"" and ""greedflation,"" which reflect a more speculative and market-oriented perspective regarding interest rate policies and economic conditions.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. The phrases used in the first text, such as ""it's extraordinarily low"" and ""overall, unemployment of 3.7% is... a strong labor market,"" imply a sense of optimism about the labor market and economic conditions. It focuses on wage increases, particularly for lower-income individuals, suggesting a beneficial outlook despite challenges. In contrast, the second text presents a more cautious tone, as seen in phrases like ""not enough to conclude that the Fed will ease anytime soon"" and ""the economy has shown resilience,"" which indicate a recognition of existing worries and uncertainties around tight labor markets and inflation. Although the overall tone of both texts leans neutral, the first text is subtly more optimistic regarding employment conditions.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text expresses a higher level of certainty compared to the second text. For example, assertions such as ""we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment"" and ""we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 2%"" convey strong confidence in the Federal Reserve's goals and actions. It reflects a definitive stance on employment rate trends and inflation concerns. In contrast, the second text displays lower certainty through less assertive language, particularly in sections like ""it may even mean boosting rates further"" and ""it's not clear how much,"" which introduce ambiguity about future events and outcomes. The use of qualifiers like ""may"" and ""not clear"" reduces the level of certainty in the second text, making it seem more tentative in its conclusions."

We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. Steve. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I think a couple of times in your opening remarks talked about this language in determining the extent of additional policy firmly that may be appropriate. Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on the way and should we also believe that all future meetings say September and November are live or are you in a every other meeting mode? Thank you. So we haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. It's not something we've looked at. We're going to be going meeting by meeting. And as we go into each meeting, we're going to be asking ourselves the same question. So we haven't made any decisions about any future meetings, including the pace at which we consider hiking. But we're going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate. You read the language to return inflation to 2% over time. I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations. Economic activity remained resilient. Job creation remained strong while cooling a bit. And the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI report, of course, was welcome. But it's only one report, one month's data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as it will be consistent with the CPI reading. But we don't know that, and we're just going to need to see more data. So what are we going to be looking at? Really it will be the broader, the whole broader picture. And starting with, we're looking for moderate growth. We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance, including in particular in the labor market. We'll be looking at inflation. We'll be asking ourselves, does this whole collection of data as do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that's how we're thinking about the next meeting. And how we're thinking about meetings going forward potentially. But we're now mainly thinking about the next meeting. I will also say, since we're talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports. I think we have an ECI report coming later this week, which is an employment compensation index. And lots of data on economic activity. All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting. And I'll close by saying we've raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022. Monetary policy, we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. If I could just briefly follow up on something you said there, you said the data in the intervening period, it probably came in in line with expectations. Does that mean there's unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the committee that two more hikes are necessary? I'm just going to go back to what I said. That's the question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting and all that data that I've decided. We're going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And really, we did have the one good reading. And of course, we welcome that, but it's just one reading. As everybody knows, and we've seen this before in the data, many forecasts call for inflation to remain low, but we just don't know that until we see the data. So we'll be focusing on that. Gina. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Obviously, you upgraded the language around growth in the statement today. We've seen the Barbie movie numbers. We've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this summer. It seems like the American consumers in pretty good shape. And it does seem like growth is picking back up a little bit or at least doing well. And I wonder from your perspective, if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing, but performing well this summer, is that a problem?",0.0038076593123776,24,2023-07-26,True,True,False,False,"The Committee will continue to

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 26, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 percent, effective July 27, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to

 domestic policy directive:

 The Federal Reserve rates decision will likely determine if the Dow Jones Industrial Average makes history..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
 Overall, it seems that the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation..“We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for the economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks.”
 Essentially, as Moody’s Analytics economist Matt Colyar told Vox ahead of the announcement, “We think June’s inflation report is kind of a harbinger of the next couple, and that’ll give them the confidence to kind of wait and see.”
 Is a recession looming?.“It’s our belief that the US economy avoids recession and that the Fed’s next rate hike, which everybody expects this afternoon, is more than we think is needed,” Colyar said..“And that aligns with inflation slowing, the [Fed board of governors] feeling really confident that inflation is where they need it to be, if not trending toward it.”

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text has a more conversational tone, reflecting a discussion about future policy decisions and meetings, while the second text is more formal and structured, presenting a factual report on recent policy decisions.
2. The first text emphasizes the ongoing assessment of incoming data and how it informs decisions “meeting by meeting,” while the second text provides a straightforward account of recent economic indicators and actions taken by the Committee.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides extensive commentary on various economic conditions and nuances around the FOMC's decision-making process, including specifics about upcoming reports, whereas the second text focuses more on summarizing recent actions and decisions taken by the Federal Reserve.
2. The first text discusses the importance of restoring price stability and its implications for employment, while the second text primarily addresses the raising of interest rates as a response to economic conditions.

2. The first text uses ""meeting by meeting"" to describe decision-making, while the second text utilizes “cumulative tightening of monetary policy” to address the overall stance of monetary policy.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive sentiment through phrases that highlight optimism about economic recovery and the commitment to achieving inflation goals. For instance, it mentions ""we remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% goal"" and ""economic activity remained resilient,"" which indicates a sense of confidence in the economy's direction. In contrast, the second text, while still neutral, states that ""inflation remains elevated"" and emphasizes the challenges posed by ""tighter credit conditions,"" which introduces a subtly more negative view of current economic conditions.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a higher level of certainty, particularly in statements where it asserts future actions: ""we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting"" and ""it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted."" This shows a proactive approach to policy adjustments based on data.

2. The second text mentions ""aggressive rate hikes"" which suggests a sense of urgency, while the first text refers to ""meeting by meeting"" as part of a more measured approach to monetary policy adjustments.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text displays a slightly more positive emotional bias than the second text, primarily through its language that emphasizes commitment and resilience. Phrases such as ""We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% goal"" and ""Restoring price stability is essential"" convey a sense of determination and optimism about achieving economic stability. In contrast, the second text contains phrases like ""the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation"" and questions like ""Is a recession looming?"" which introduce a note of uncertainty and caution regarding the economic outlook. Such phrasing suggests a more neutral or slightly negative stance compared to the proactive language in the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty  
Explanation: Both texts express a similar level of certainty in their statements, but they frame that certainty differently. The first text maintains an assurance of decision-making based on careful assessment, with phrases such as ""we're going to be asking ourselves the same question"" and ""we will go ahead and raise rates"" if needed. Meanwhile, the second text states, “the Fed will make decisions based on data” and “should not be assumed,” indicating a data-driven approach but similar in its careful assessment without prematurely concluding. Both texts reflect a moderate level of certainty rather than strong confidence, which results in a comparison of similar certainty levels."
2023-07-26 18:45:00,2023-07-26 18:50:00," broad sense that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really sorry, but what your question was. Well, I mean, you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three? So I guess I would put it this way. We, I'd say it this way. It's really a question of how do you balance the two risks, the risk of doing too much or doing too little. And, you know, we, I would say that, you know, we're coming to a place where, where there really are risks on both sides. It's hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not. But as our, as our stance has become more restrictive, and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk. But, you know, we, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far. You know, as, as you know, we think, and most economists think that core inflation is actually a better signal of, of, of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices. So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because that's what we think is, that's core is, is signaling where headlines going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know. There's a reason to think it, it can come down now, but it's, it's still quite elevated. So we think we need to stay on task, and we think we're going to need to hold, certainly hold policy at a restricted levels for some time. And we need to be prepared to raise further if that, if we think that's appropriate. Well, and then, if inflation were to just a quick follow, if it stays at three or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation? People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation. So, but how much, again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last one? So it is, it is a very positive thing that actually the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of 22, at 3.6%. So that's a real blessing, and that we've been able to achieve some disinflation. And we don't seek to, it's not that we're aiming to raise unemployment, but I would just say the historical record. We have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. And so that is still the likely outcome here. And we hope that that's as little as possible. We have to be honest that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done. However, the short-term social costs of getting inflation under control, the longer-term social costs of failing to do so are greater. And that the historical record is very, very clear on that. If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile. It interferes with people's lives and with economic activity. And that's the thing we really need to avoid and will avoid. At this point, you say the policy is restrictive, but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation lately to the downside. So I'm wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions? Do you think you might need to do more? Because I'm curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now, as the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation. People talk about base effects and higher energy costs. And now we have some large labor settlements. Or is the economy disinflating? And you're just able to go back to the old-fed policy of opportunistic disinflation. So I'll just say, again, the broader picture of what we want to see is we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic-related distortions to demand and supply. We want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures. We want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market, and all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. And what we see is we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together, and we're seeing evidence, those things now. But I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down, sustainably toward our 2% target, and we're prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process still probably has a long way to go. Well, do you think under current conditions you are restricted?",-0.0010512023126451,25,2023-07-26,True,False,False,False,"Inflation remains elevated..Tighter credit conditions for households

 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 percent, effective July 27, 2023.","Though inflation has come down significantly in recent months, it’s still above the Fed target rate of 2 percent..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
 Overall, it seems that the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation..“We remain strongly committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal,” Powell said..“It’s our belief that the US economy avoids recession and that the Fed’s next rate hike, which everybody expects this afternoon, is more than we think is needed,” Colyar said..“It is unnecessary when conditions are already tight enough for inflation to come down to the Fed’s target.”
 Many economists agree..“And that aligns with inflation slowing, the [Fed board of governors] feeling really confident that inflation is where they need it to be, if not trending toward it.”
 Update, July 26, 3:05 pm ET: This story was published on July 26 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to include comments delivered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell..“It’s likely that mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate in the face of the uncertainty that permeates today’s economy.”

 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 26, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 percent, effective July 27, 2023..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 5.5
 percent, effective July 27, 2023.","Though inflation has come down significantly in recent months, it’s still above the Fed target rate of 2 percent..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
 Overall, it seems that the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation..“We remain strongly committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal,” Powell said..“We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for the economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks.”

 Key Background
 The Fed’s campaign to hike interest rates had prompted fears of a recession, as rate increases usually stem inflation at the cost of slowing the economy..After reaching a 40-year high last summer, inflation last month fell to its lowest point in more than two years, with the Labor Department’s consumer price index coming in 3% higher than it was in June 2022—still somewhat above the Fed’s 2% target.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: inflation dynamics, last mile of inflation, core inflation, disinflation, labor market conditions
2. Second Text: economic activity, credit conditions, maximum employment, monetary policy firming, federal funds rate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss inflation and its effects on the economy and employment.
2. Both texts emphasize the importance of achieving a target inflation rate (2 percent) and the balancing act required in monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on a conversational aspect with questions about the implications of inflation and unemployment, reflecting uncertainty about achieving goals.
2. The second text adopts a more formal and structured tone, explicitly outlining decisions made by the Federal Reserve and potential impacts of monetary policy on inflation and employment.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a broader discussion of inflation's effects, including references to historical records and the implications for the labor market.
2. The second text concentrates on recent monetary policy actions and decisions made by the Federal Reserve, with specific details regarding interest rates and policy implementation.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""core inflation"" and ""last mile of inflation,"" which emphasize the nuanced discussion of inflation metrics.
2. The second text employs technical terms like ""federal funds rate"" and ""monetary policy firming,"" which are more focused on the mechanics of policy implementation.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text expresses a slightly more positive sentiment through phrases that acknowledge progress and hope regarding inflation, like ""it's a very positive thing that actually the unemployment rate is the same"" and ""we do increasingly face that risk."" These phrases suggest an optimistic outlook about current economic conditions despite challenges. In contrast, the second text tends toward a neutral tone, primarily stating facts without showing an explicit emotional bias; it describes the economic situation with phrases such as ""Inflation remains elevated"" and ""Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity."" The absence of optimistic expressions makes the second text feel more neutral compared to the first.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text shows a lower level of certainty as the speaker often qualifies statements with phrases like ""it is hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not"" and ""policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects."" This language implies some uncertainty about the efficacy of current policies. In contrast, the second text exhibits a higher level of certainty with phrases like ""The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks"" and ""The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective."" These statements convey a clear, confident stance on the Committee's goals, showcasing a more decisive perspective compared to the more cautious framing of the first text.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: disinflation, core inflation, restrictiveness of policy, historical record, balancing risks
2. Second Text: consumer price index, rate hike, soft landing, aggressive approach, economic activity

Similarities:

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on balancing risks and the specific technical measures of inflation's relationship with labor market conditions, presenting a more nuanced and cautious tone.
2. The second text adopts a more straightforward reporting style, emphasizing upcoming actions of the Fed and the potential for economic recession, presenting a slightly more urgent tone regarding market conditions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text delves deeper into the implications of inflation on social costs and historical records of central bank actions, providing a more comprehensive analysis of inflation dynamics.
2. The second text summarizes recent economic reports and forecasts, providing less detail on the historical implications and focusing more on the current action narrative of the Fed.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text employs terminology like ""core inflation"" and ""disinflation,"" emphasizing a technical analysis of inflation indicators, while the second text uses phrases like ""consumer price index"" and ""soft landing"" that are more focused on public communications and expectations.

Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. Phrases such as ""it's really a question of how do you balance the two risks,"" and ""it's a real blessing"" reflect a sense of cautious optimism regarding the balance of risks associated with inflation. In contrast, the second text includes phrases like ""despite being the lowest it’s been since March 2021,"" and ""the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go,"" which indicate ongoing concerns and a level of skepticism about reaching the target rate. The emphasis on potential positive outcomes in the first text, especially towards unemployment and the commitment to disinflation, lends it a more positive undertone.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty  
Explanation: Both texts express a comparable level of certainty, although they approach it differently. The first text demonstrates moderate certainty with phrases like ""we think that core inflation is actually a better signal"" and ""we need to be prepared to raise further if that, if we think that's appropriate,"" which incorporates both assurance and the acknowledgment of potential changes in circumstances. Meanwhile, the second text uses phrases like ""the Fed is widely expected to announce"" and ""we expect the [Federal Reserve] to remain focused,"" indicating a steady confidence in outcomes without declaring absolute certainties. Both texts carry an air of measured confidence, making their levels of certainty relatively similar overall."

Could you break down the reasons why inflation is fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes, or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year? Yeah. So, interesting question. So let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we've always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from both from the normalization of those broad pandemic-related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive monetary policy, which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think that's broadly what we're seeing. So to go break it down a little further, of course, headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down mostly due to reversal of the effects from the war in Ukraine. And that's a good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier, for core inflation, I'd say there also, there has been a role for both factors, both that I mentioned. Clearly, for goods, normalization of supply conditions is playing an important role as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal of spending back into services and away from goods. And say take auditors as an example, the combination of an increase in sales and imitories while vehicle inflation has decelerated points to a substantial role for supply. But there's also a role for demand as the loans and things like that are more expensive. So they're both working there. Housing services inflation now starts to move down. Clearly higher rates have slowed the housing market. I would say monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think it'll play an important role going forward in particular in non-housing services where really we think that's where the labor market will come in as a very important factor. So we think both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role. And just to follow up, do you think that of those two sources that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes, or is there more even split there too? I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward because we're sort of reaping now the benefits of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things. We're seeing that with goods in particular. Those supply chains and shortages moving, and we're seeing, so I think going forward monetary policy will be important particularly in the sector, in the non-housing services sector. Thank you, Chair. Well, first let me compliment your tie, the choice of tie. So thanks for taking our question. First of the beige book, it said input cost pressures remain elevated for services firms, but ease notably for manufacturing sectors. That indication that there's a wage inflation pressure, and how do you target and pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into recession? I think as it relates to goods, it's really an indication that supply chains and shortages are easing. And so what was the first part of it? So wage inflation, how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into recession? I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions, and that's what we're seeing. So, wages have actually been gradually moving down. There's still at levels what would be consistent over a long period of time with 2% inflation, nonetheless, we're making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that, you can look at the quits rate normalizing, you can look at job openings coming down, you can look at job creation in the establishment survey, it's still at a high level, but it was a extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So you see cooling, particularly in private sector, in the last report. So I think we see that, and it's happening in a gradual pace. So that's actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy, people are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money, and that's really what's driving an economy, but that it's gradually slowing, it's gradually cooling, that's a good prescription for getting where we want to get. But still we see a push to raise minimum.",-0.0010515247108307,26,2023-07-26,True,False,False,False,"Inflation remains elevated..Tighter credit conditions for households

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 26, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 percent, effective July 27, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective July 27, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 5.5
 percent, effective July 27, 2023.","Though inflation has come down significantly in recent months, it’s still above the Fed target rate of 2 percent..In June, the consumer price index, viewed as a proxy for inflation, was still 3 percent, despite being the lowest it’s been since March 2021..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”

 Key Facts
 Powell said in a press conference the “resiliency in the economy” recently prompted Fed staff to downgrade their forecast, which Powell noted is “independent” of the predictions made by members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee..When asked about inflation, Powell said the Fed has “seen the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.”

 The Fed’s Open Market Committee decided unanimously this week to increase the federal funds rate to a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years, adding in an announcement that the central bank will “assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.”
 Key Background
 The Fed’s campaign to hike interest rates had prompted fears of a recession, as rate increases usually stem inflation at the cost of slowing the economy..After reaching a 40-year high last summer, inflation last month fell to its lowest point in more than two years, with the Labor Department’s consumer price index coming in 3% higher than it was in June 2022—still somewhat above the Fed’s 2% target..Further Reading

 Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools
 and approach used to implement monetary policy.","Though inflation has come down significantly in recent months, it’s still above the Fed target rate of 2 percent..In June, the consumer price index, viewed as a proxy for inflation, was still 3 percent, despite being the lowest it’s been since March 2021..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
 Overall, it seems that the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation..“We remain strongly committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal,” Powell said..“We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for the economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks.”
 Essentially, as Moody’s Analytics economist Matt Colyar told Vox ahead of the announcement, “We think June’s inflation report is kind of a harbinger of the next couple, and that’ll give them the confidence to kind of wait and see.”
 Is a recession looming?.“It is unnecessary when conditions are already tight enough for inflation to come down to the Fed’s target.”
 Many economists agree..“And that aligns with inflation slowing, the [Fed board of governors] feeling really confident that inflation is where they need it to be, if not trending toward it.”
 Update, July 26, 3:05 pm ET: This story was published on July 26 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to include comments delivered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell..“It’s likely that mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate in the face of the uncertainty that permeates today’s economy.”

 July 26 (UPI) -- Even with renewed consumer confidence in the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday is widely expected to announce it will keep battling inflation with aggressive rate hikes..Advertisement
 Lorie Logan, a voting member at the Federal Reserve and the president of the central bank in Dallas, said that inflationary data and labor trends suggest further rate hikes may be necessary to cool the economy..""The continuing outlook for above-target inflation and a stronger-than-expected labor market calls for more-restrictive monetary policy,"" she said in early July..That backs late June comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that economic activity was expanding, but inflation remained above the 2% target rate set by the Fed..Advertisement
 ""Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year,"" he said..""Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."".Also, economists are noticing better business conditions and investors have grown more bullish on the Fed's chances of pulling off a soft landing, a scenario in which the central bank succeeds at bringing down inflation without tanking the economy..This new-found confidence comes as inflation has slowed and the economy has held up -- all on the backdrop of 10 straight rate hikes since the Fed began to lift rates in March 2022..A hawkish Fed wants to keep hopes in check
 The Fed doesn't want to back itself into a corner where it doesn't have the option of hiking, at least not without surprising financial markets..""Powell will still maintain a fairly hawkish line, I don't think they're going to back off yet, but they'll have to acknowledge the fact that inflation has come down, so they will lean to the labor market still being very strong,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, told CNN..The Fed is closely watching the labor market for signs that demand and supply are coming back ""into better balance,"" as Powell describes it..Powell is likely to talk tough on inflation and suggest another rate hike in September could be possible as the central bank works to bring inflation back to its 2% target..Powell is expected to err on the side of reiterating the Fed has more work to do even as inflation data showed consumer prices in June rose at the slowest pace since March 2021, with headline CPI rising 3% — down from a 9% at its peak last summer..Despite evidence that inflation has retreated significantly in recent months, the resilience of the labor market could mean the Fed would still be open to another rate hike before the end of the year..IS THE FED MANAGING TO DEFEAT INFLATION?.U.S. inflation has fallen for 12 months..While that's the lowest the annual inflation rate has been in more than two years, it's still too high for the Federal Reserve, which is looking to wrestle increases down to about 2%..""The economy has been remarkably resilient, the labor market is still robust, but that may be contributing to the stubbornly high inflation,"" McBride said..The Federal Reserve is in charge of balancing unemployment and inflation..""We expect the [Federal Reserve] to remain focused on slowing the job market to pave the way for a sustained return to the 2% inflation target,"" the analysts wrote..The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday, and economists will be watching for hints at what officials expect next — and how they think the central bank’s fight against rapid inflation is going..The Federal Reserve’s policymakers still think prices are rising too fast and are almost certain to lift their key interest rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday
 Another hike is widely expected despite a run of encouraging news that has sent stock prices steadily higher, boosted consumer confidence and brightened hopes that the Fed can pull off a difficult “soft landing,” in which inflation would continue to slow toward the Fed’s 2 percent target without sending the economy tumbling into a recession..And it would be down sharply from a 3.8 percent year-over-year increase in Ma

 After a year’s worth of warnings around a nationwide economic downturn, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the central bank’s staff are no longer forecasting a recession, as the Fed aims to stem inflation by raising interest rates without causing an economic downturn..Getty Images
 Key Facts
 Powell said in a press conference the “resiliency in the economy” recently prompted Fed staff to downgrade their forecast, which Powell noted is “independent” of the predictions made by members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee..The Fed had predicted a “mild recession” in April, and notes from the Federal Open Markets Committee said last month it was “quite likely” for the economy to tip into a recession this year, but that recession would be “neither deep nor prolonged.” The new forecast comes on the heels of the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to a 22-year high, after leaving rates steady last month, as the Fed continues its aggressive rate hikes in an attempt to combat high inflation..When asked about inflation, Powell said the Fed has “seen the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.”
 News Peg
 The Fed’s Open Market Committee decided unanimously this week to increase the federal funds rate to a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years, adding in an announcement that the central bank will “assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy.”
 Key Background
 The Fed’s campaign to hike interest rates had prompted fears of a recession, as rate increases usually stem inflation at the cost of slowing the economy..After reaching a 40-year high last summer, inflation last month fell to its lowest point in more than two years, with the Labor Department’s consumer price index coming in 3% higher than it was in June 2022—still somewhat above the Fed’s 2% target..Further Reading

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text adopts a more conversational tone, focusing on specific consumer experiences and the implications of labor market conditions, while the second text presents a formal overview of macroeconomic policy and committee decisions.
2. The first text dives into the specifics of supply and demand dynamics and effects of the pandemic, while the second text provides a broad agenda for future monetary policy actions without delving into causal narratives.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text covers detailed discussions on supply chain issues, the housing market, and what factors contribute to inflation changes, whereas the second text focuses more on overarching policy stances and intentions without granular detail.
2. The first text includes anecdotal commentary and specific economic indicators, while the second text sticks to formal statements and broad assessments of economic activity.

Specific Terminology Differences:

2. The second text employs structured terminology related to committee decisions and policy implementation, which is not the focus of the first text's more qualitative analysis.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys an optimistic interpretation of the economic conditions, particularly regarding inflation and the labor market. Phrases like ""that's a good thing"" and ""that's really what's driving an economy"" highlight a subtle sense of positivity toward the gradual cooling of labor demand and the overall economic recovery. In contrast, the second text acknowledges challenges such as ""inflation remains elevated"" and ""tighter credit conditions... are likely to weigh on economic activity."" These points introduce a slightly more negative viewpoint by emphasizing risks and caution. While both texts aim to discuss the economic situation neutrally, the first text contains more positive language relating to the outcomes of economic policies.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text displays lower certainty regarding the future trajectory of monetary policy and economic conditions.

The speaker acknowledges multiple factors influencing inflation and the economy, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. Conversely, the second text exhibits a high level of certainty through phrases such as ""The Committee remains highly attentive"" and ""the Committee is strongly committed,"" which illustrate a definitive stance on maintaining inflation targets. This signifies a more confident outlook compared to the cautious tone of the first text, which is more exploratory in nature.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. This is evidenced by phrases like “that’s a good thing,” and “that’s really what’s driving an economy,” which indicate an optimistic outlook regarding the gradual cooling of the labor market and the decreasing inflation. The first text frequently uses phrases that celebrate the ongoing recovery and normalization from the pandemic’s economic disruptions, while the second text expresses concerns regarding the persistence of inflation above the Fed’s target and the need for continued aggressive measures to combat it. The second text mentions aspects like “unnecessary” inflation pressures and “looming recession,” which lean towards a more cautious and slightly negative sentiment.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty
Explanation: Both texts display a similar level of certainty, though with slight variations in their expression. The first text demonstrates confidence in the ongoing disinflationary process with phrases like “we think that’s broadly what we’re seeing,” which conveys assurance in their observations and predictions. In contrast, the second text uses cautious language such as “it’s likely” and “may be necessary,” which suggests a moderate level of certainty regarding the future actions of the Fed. However, the use of terms like “expect” and “no longer forecasting a recession” in the second text also indicates a level of confidence, aligning it closely with the first text's certainty level despite the latter's slightly more affirmative tone."

So we're seeing that kind of cooling and that's very healthy. And we hope it continues. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Jeff Cox from Cmbc.com. You and other Fed officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2% that as long as you see continued progress. I'm wondering how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down? How many months of data do you need to see that will give you sufficient confidence? And how far does this fight need to go before you're willing to kind of declare victory on it? So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2% it would be a prescription of going way past the target. That's clearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So in effect, if you look at our forecasts, we, the median participant and again, these are forecasting out here. So take them with a grain of salt, but people are cutting rates next year because the federal funds rate is at a restrictive level now. So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, that we don't need to be at a restrictive level anymore. We can move back to a neutral level and then below a neutral level at a certain point. I think we would, of course, would be very careful about that. We'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be, but that's the way I would think about it is, you'd start, you'd stop raising long before you, you got to 2% inflation, and you'd start cutting before you got to 2% inflation too, because we don't see ourselves getting a 2% inflation until, you know, all the way back to two until 2025 or so. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Seanberger with Yahoo Finance. It's been over four months since a handful of regional banks including Silicon Valley bank failed. When you look at credit conditions now, given Bank of California's acquisition of PAC West, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt, or are you comfortable saying that we've seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this point, and how does this play into your outlook for policy? So I didn't want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say things have settled down, for sure, out there, deposit flows of stabilized capital and liquidity remains strong, aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter, and has up significantly year-over-year banking sector profits generally are coming in strong this quarter, and overall the banking system remains strong in resilient. Of course, we're still watching, you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in the banking sector. In terms of the actual effect on, if you think of a particular set of banks that were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that were more affected by the turmoil in March, then others, it's very hard, as I mentioned, it's very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening. They may be tightening a little bit more probably are than other banks. The sluice has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are tightening, that process is ongoing, and that will restrain economic growth. So I think we have to take a step back from, I can't separate those anymore. I think basically we're just looking at the overall picture, which is one of tightening credit conditions, and that's going to restrain economic activity, is restraining economic activity. So that's how I would look at it. And how is that informing your outlook for sending policy? So I think that goes, that is an expected result of tightening interest rate policy, is that bank credit conditions, would bank lending conditions, would tighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May? I just don't think we know that. I think we're looking at the current data in GDP, and we're seeing strong spending, we're seeing a strong economy, and it's made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. And it seems like the economy is weathering this well, but of course we're watching it carefully, and expect it to continue to do that.

 Lorie Logan, a voting member at the Federal Reserve and the president of the central bank in Dallas, said that inflationary data and labor trends suggest further rate hikes may be necessary to cool the economy..""The continuing outlook for above-target inflation and a stronger-than-expected labor market calls for more-restrictive monetary policy,"" she said in early July..That backs late June comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said that economic activity was expanding, but inflation remained above the 2% target rate set by the Fed..""Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."".This new-found confidence comes as inflation has slowed and the economy has held up -- all on the backdrop of 10 straight rate hikes since the Fed began to lift rates in March 2022..The end of rate hikes would usher in the next phase of the Fed's inflation fight, which would likely be to simply hold rates steady until inflation is fully tamped down..""Powell will still maintain a fairly hawkish line, I don't think they're going to back off yet, but they'll have to acknowledge the fact that inflation has come down, so they will lean to the labor market still being very strong,"" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, told CNN..""If inflation does not continue to show progress and there are no suggestions of a significant slowdown in economic activity, then a second 25-basis-point [ quarter-point ] hike should come sooner rather than later, but that decision is for the future,"" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said this month in a forum..The Fed now expects inflation to end the year closer to 4%, up from 3.6% previously and nearly double its inflation target..""The last thing policymakers want is for markets to start pricing the Fed’s terminal rate and rapid rate cuts in 2024 which would lead to looser financial conditions and upside risks to demand and inflation."".Powell is expected to err on the side of reiterating the Fed has more work to do even as inflation data showed consumer prices in June rose at the slowest pace since March 2021, with headline CPI rising 3% — down from a 9% at its peak last summer..Despite evidence that inflation has retreated significantly in recent months, the resilience of the labor market could mean the Fed would still be open to another rate hike before the end of the year..Yet by then, most economists think inflation – and the economy – will have cooled enough that another hike won’t be needed..While that's the lowest the annual inflation rate has been in more than two years, it's still too high for the Federal Reserve, which is looking to wrestle increases down to about 2%..""We expect the [Federal Reserve] to remain focused on slowing the job market to pave the way for a sustained return to the 2% inflation target,"" the analysts wrote..Another hike is widely expected despite a run of encouraging news that has sent stock prices steadily higher, boosted consumer confidence and brightened hopes that the Fed can pull off a difficult “soft landing,” in which inflation would continue to slow toward the Fed’s 2% target without sending the economy tumbling into a recession..Yet by then, most economists think inflation — and the economy — will have cooled enough that another hike won’t be needed..“I’m sceptical that inflation is going to come down fast enough and so I think that there’s a reasonable chance that they do an incremental hike, beyond this one,” he says..The Federal Reserve’s policymakers still think prices are rising too fast and are almost certain to lift their key interest rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday
 Another hike is widely expected despite a run of encouraging news that has sent stock prices steadily higher, boosted consumer confidence and brightened hopes that the Fed can pull off a difficult “soft landing,” in which inflation would continue to slow toward the Fed’s 2 percent target without sending the economy tumbling into a recession..The Fed had predicted a “mild recession” in April, and notes from the Federal Open Markets Committee said last month it was “quite likely” for the economy to tip into a recession this year, but that recession would be “neither deep nor prolonged.” The new forecast comes on the heels of the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to a 22-year high, after leaving rates steady last month, as the Fed continues its aggressive rate hikes in an attempt to combat high inflation..When asked about inflation, Powell said the Fed has “seen the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.”

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 26, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances to 5.4 percent, effective July 27, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective July 27, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent..• In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted
 unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 5.5
 percent, effective July 27, 2023.","Though inflation has come down significantly in recent months, it’s still above the Fed target rate of 2 percent..Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed those concerns in a news conference Wednesday, saying, “In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
 Overall, it seems that the Fed is looking to slow, but not stop, its aggressive approach to inflation..“We remain strongly committed to bringing inflation down to our 2 percent goal,” Powell said..“We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for the economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks.”
 Essentially, as Moody’s Analytics economist Matt Colyar told Vox ahead of the announcement, “We think June’s inflation report is kind of a harbinger of the next couple, and that’ll give them the confidence to kind of wait and see.”
 Is a recession looming?.“It’s our belief that the US economy avoids recession and that the Fed’s next rate hike, which everybody expects this afternoon, is more than we think is needed,” Colyar said..“And that aligns with inflation slowing, the [Fed board of governors] feeling really confident that inflation is where they need it to be, if not trending toward it.”

1. First Text: labor supply, cooling, banking sector profits, tightening credit conditions, regional banks, economic growth, inflation coming down sustainably
2. Second Text: maximum employment, federal funds rate, policy firming, cumulative tightening of monetary policy, inflation expectations, monetary policy implementation, open market operations

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of the economy, particularly focusing on inflation and interest rates.
2. Each text highlights the role of monetary policy and its implications for economic activity and inflation.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the ongoing effects of regional bank failures and credit conditions on the economy, whereas the second text focuses on the Committee's decisions and future outlook for monetary policy.
2. The first text conveys a more conversational tone with direct questions posed to a Federal Reserve official, while the second text is more formal and structured as an official communication of policy decisions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text discusses specific details regarding the impact of bank failures on lending and economic activity, while the second text outlines policy decisions and commitments without much context about past events.
2. The first text gives insights into the Federal Reserve's views on inflation trends over time, contrasting the second text’s focus on immediate policy actions.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""overheated labor market"" and ""credit conditions"" which suggest a discussion of market dynamics, while the second text uses regulatory and procedural terms like ""policy firming"" and ""monetary policy implementation.""
2. The first text references ""tightening credit conditions"" in the context of economic impact, while the second text speaks to ""cumulative tightening of monetary policy"" which indicates an emphasis on systematic policy measures.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text carries a more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. Phrases such as ""labor supply has improved,"" ""that's very healthy,"" and ""things have settled down, for sure"" illustrate an optimistic outlook about economic conditions and the labor market. This contrasts with the second text, which presents a more neutral and cautious stance, using phrases like ""inflation remains elevated"" and ""tighter credit conditions...are likely to weigh on economic activity."" The overall tone of the first text expresses hope and stability while the second text maintains a focus on potential risks and limitations, thus making the first text's sentiment slightly more positive.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty because it includes phrases that qualify statements, such as ""it's very hard to make...numerical assessment"" and ""we're still watching, you know, the situation carefully."" This indicates a degree of uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. In contrast, the second text expresses a higher certainty level, as evidenced by statements like ""The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective"" and ""the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously,"" which reflect confidence and decisiveness in policy decisions. Hence, the first text appears to express a lower level of certainty relative to the more assertive and confident stance of the second text.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: cooling labor market, restrictive level, aggregate bank lending, tightening credit conditions, sustainable inflation
2. Second Text: policy firming, cumulative tightening, aggressive rate hikes, soft landing, disinflation

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's approach to managing inflation and the implications of interest rate hikes.
2. They address the overall economic conditions, including labor market resilience and the influence of credit conditions on the economy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the technical aspects of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts, exhibiting a more nuanced discussion of Fed strategies.
2. The second text emphasizes market expectations and consumer confidence, reflecting a more outward-facing discussion of how economic developments are perceived by analysts and economists.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text delves deeper into the timing and conditions required for cutting rates, including specific indicators like inflation and labor market performance.
2. The second text discusses the Fed's aggressive stance and public statements more generally, touching on the broader implications for the economy and how individuals and markets may respond to these policies.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text mentions ""median participant"" and ""credit conditions,"" which are specific to the internal dynamics of the Federal Reserve's decision-making process.
2. The second text uses terms like ""policy firming"" and ""soft landing,"" which relate to broader economic concepts and expectations from external analysts.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. Phrases such as ""that's very healthy"" when discussing labor supply improvements and ""we're seeing strong spending, we're seeing a strong economy"" convey a sense of optimism about the current economic conditions. Additionally, the first text expresses confidence in the Fed's approach, suggesting that it does not need to overly restrict rates. In contrast, the second text has a more cautious tone, emphasizing uncertainty with phrases like ""it’s likely that mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate in the face of the uncertainty that permeates today’s economy"" and acknowledges the challenges posed by inflation. The acknowledgment of a ""looming recession"" and the need for further rate hikes in the second text also indicates a more negative emotional tone.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text reflects a lower level of certainty than the second text, especially in terms of economic projections and future actions. The phrase ""it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment"" indicates a hesitance and lack of confidence in specific predictions. In contrast, the second text asserts more certainty in certain conclusions, such as ""it is our belief that the US economy avoids recession"" and indications of the Fed's commitment to achieving its inflation target, suggesting more confidence in the outcomes discussed. Overall, while the first text expresses a range of opinions based on ongoing developments, it lacks the definitive assertions that characterize the second text."
2023-09-20 18:45:00,2023-09-20 18:50:00," infinite that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2% over time. That's what we need to get to. And we've been moving toward it as we've gotten closer to it. We slowed the pace at which we've moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we're getting closer, again, we have the ability to proceed carefully. Okay, let's go to Steve. Steve Lee's been seeing it. He's seeing it. He's seeing it. I want to return to Colby's question here. What is it saying about the committee's view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year, but need another half a point over the funds rate on it? Does it tell you that? Does it tell us that the committee believes inflation to be more persistent, requires more medicine effectively? I guess a related question is, if you're going to project a funds rate above the longer run rate for four years in a row, at what point do we start to think, hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher? Thank you. So I guess I would point more to, rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent. I wouldn't think that's not, we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data. It's more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So if I had to attribute one thing, again, we're picking a median here and trying to attribute one explanation, but I think broadly, stronger economic activity means rates. We have to do more with rates, and that's what that meaning is telling you. In terms of what the neutral rate can be, we know it by its works. We only know it by its works, really. We can't, you know, the models that we use, ultimately you only know when you get there, and by the way, the economy reacts on again. That's another reason why we're moving carefully now, because there are lags here. So it may, of course, be that the neutral rate has risen. You don't see the median moving, but you do see people raising their estimates of the neutral rate, and it's certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than the longer run rate. Remember what we write down in the SEP is the longer run rate. It is certainly possible that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than expected. Let's go in Howard. Howard, Shetty with Rodgers, thank you. So you've said several times that the economy needed a period of below trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2%. You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit. 1.5% is just a touch below what's the estimate of potential. So the fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works and change in how you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this? Yes, of course, it is a good thing that we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment. And that's because we're seeing that rebalancing in other places, in, for example, job openings, and in the jobs worker gap. You've also seen supply side things. So that's happening. I would say, though, I still think, and I think broadly, people still think that we'll have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply as we've seen as well. Also, remember, the natural rate we think is coming down, which is a supply side thing, so that the gap between any given unemployment rate that's lower than that and the natural rate comes down, that's a way for supply, that's a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance. So all of those things are happening. You're right. In the median forecast, we don't see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase. But that really is just playing forward the trends that we've been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that's really what we've been seeing. It's progress without higher unemployment for now. So just to boil that down for a second, we've gone from a very narrow path to a soft landing to something different. Would you crawl to soft landing now, a baseline expectation? No, no. I would not do that. I would just say, what would I say about that? I've always thought that the soft landing was a pause as well.",-0.002144421119162,28,2023-09-20,True,False,False,False,"Inflation remains elevated..The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks..The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on September 20, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective September 21, 2023.","The central bank's effort to tame inflation has been a cornerstone of investor sentiment for much of 2023 and could suggest where stocks head for the rest of the year..The string of interest rate hikes reflects the Fed's efforts to douse the hottest inflation in four decades, which reached 9.1% in June 2022..Although inflation has eased significantly since then, it remains higher than the central bank's goal of 2%, raising questions about whether the improvement will be enough to convince the Fed to hold steady for now..Even though inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2% target, recent economic data will likely persuade the central bank to take a wait-and-see approach, experts said..""We look for Fed Chair Powell to stress that restrictive monetary policy has led to a notable cooling of economic activity, labor market momentum and inflation."".Inflation is still almost double the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, and it is expected to come in at around 4% for September..After 11 interest rate hikes since March last year, inflation has fallen sharply but remains stuck stubbornly above the Fed's long-run target of two percent per year -- keeping pressure on officials to consider further policy action..""Chair Powell will acknowledge recently softer inflation and lower job openings, but emphasize vigilance given remaining upside risks to inflation,"" economists from Citi wrote in an investor note published Wednesday..Fed officials again emphasized that the central bank is “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.” Officials deliberate monetary policy again at their two-day meeting next month, which concludes on November 1..‘A soft landing is a primary objective’
 Inflation has slowed steadily from its four-decade peak last June, and it could ease all the way to the Fed’s 2% target without a sharp uptick in unemployment — a scenario known as a “soft landing.” Or, inflation could eventually drift down to 2%, but with the economy slipping into a recession as unemployment rises..He said that officials determine whether the strength of GDP is “a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation.”
 Economists widely expect slower growth this year, rather than an economic slump..But beyond that, the release of the updated Summary of Economic Projections will force Fed policy-makers to show if they believe a recent run of good data can continue – with inflation slowing alongside stronger-than-anticipated job and economic growth – or whether even more restrictive monetary policy will be needed to finish the fight against rising prices despite the risks that brings of a hard stop to the post-pandemic economic expansion..Policy-makers’ projections are “likely to undergo meaningful revisions … including upgrades to growth and the labour market and a downward revision to inflation, at least in 2023,” wrote Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects the main body of Fed officials to still project one more rate hike this year..How much those values shift, particularly around the rate cuts envisioned next year, and what the first glimpse of 2026 says about the longer-run outlook, will amount to a tacit vote on whether the Fed’s faith in the soft landing, a scenario in which inflation falls without major job losses or a recession, has grown stronger because of the economy’s resilience, or weaker because of concern that price pressures might persist and force an even tighter policy stance..""So this higher-for-longer message is probably where we are starting to see concerns around interest rates being ...higher over the last couple of days and a little bit of volatility within the equity markets as of late."".Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to note up front that the job is not done on inflation and the Fed will stay the course in order to get inflation back to 2%..While inflation has accelerated for two consecutive months, a steadier slowdown in hiring, job openings and economic growth could be the signs of the Fed’s rate hikes taking hold..Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re now inclined to move more gradually and cautiously toward their goal of 2% annual inflation..Still, most recent data is pointing in the direction the Fed wants to see: Inflation in June and July, excluding volatile food and energy prices, posted its two lowest monthly readings in nearly two years..And signs have grown that the job market isn’t as robust as it had been, which helps keep a check on inflation: The pace of hiring has moderated..“Higher for longer” is likely the mantra for US rates as “inflation will remain a little bit stickier than expected.”

 Confident the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged, investors are far more focused on the release of new forecasts on Wednesday that will reveal how much U.S. central bank policy-makers buy into the prospect of an economic “soft landing” and what rate environment will prevail alongside it..But beyond that, the release of the updated Summary of Economic Projections will force Fed policy-makers to show if they believe a recent run of good data can continue – with inflation slowing alongside stronger-than-anticipated job and economic growth – or whether even more restrictive monetary policy will be needed to finish the fight against rising prices despite the risks that brings of a hard stop to the post-pandemic economic expansion..Policy-makers’ projections are “likely to undergo meaningful revisions … including upgrades to growth and the labour market and a downward revision to inflation, at least in 2023,” wrote Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects the main body of Fed officials to still project one more rate hike this year..As of the last set of quarterly projections, published in June, the median Fed policy maker end-year projection was for economic growth of 1.0 per cent, underlying inflation of 3.9 per cent, and the benchmark overnight interest rate to be in the 5.50 per cent-5.75 per cent range, just a quarter of a percentage point above the range approved at the last meeting in July..How much those values shift, particularly around the rate cuts envisioned next year, and what the first glimpse of 2026 says about the longer-run outlook, will amount to a tacit vote on whether the Fed’s faith in the soft landing, a scenario in which inflation falls without major job losses or a recession, has grown stronger because of the economy’s resilience, or weaker because of concern that price pressures might persist and force an even tighter policy stance..Rates now stand in the range of 5.25%-5.5%, following 11 rate hikes since March 2022, the most aggressive action from the central bank to tackle inflation since the 1980s..""So this higher-for-longer message is probably where we are starting to see concerns around interest rates being ...higher over the last couple of days and a little bit of volatility within the equity markets as of late."".Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to note up front that the job is not done on inflation and the Fed will stay the course in order to get inflation back to 2%..While inflation has accelerated for two consecutive months, a steadier slowdown in hiring, job openings and economic growth could be the signs of the Fed’s rate hikes taking hold..Political consequences of the Fed’s inflation fight
 Whether the Fed succeeds in curbing inflation without causing a recession could have serious implications for the 2024 presidential election..By pulling its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades, the Fed has helped inflation to cool from its peak last year but at the cost of hurting prices for investments and damaging some corners of the economy..Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear that they’re now inclined to move more gradually and cautiously toward their goal of 2% annual inflation..Still, most recent data is pointing in the direction the Fed wants to see: Inflation in June and July, excluding volatile food and energy prices, posted its two lowest monthly readings in nearly two years..And signs have grown that the job market isn’t as robust as it had been, which helps keep a check on inflation: The pace of hiring has moderated..There are growing expectations that Fed chairman Jerome Powell will restate the “higher-for-longer” message on interest rates to curb inflation, defying hopes that he will repeat the European Central Bank’s message last week that they were probably done with raising rates..“Higher for longer” is likely the mantra for US rates as “inflation will remain a little bit stickier than expected.”

 Sundstrom’s view comes as Treasury yields climb back to their highest since 2007, thanks to a renewed rise in oil prices and a growing recognition the Fed may keep rates elevated until inflation returns to acceptable levels..""I think that they will keep that bias towards higher rates in there and indicate that they are willing to raise the funds rate further if the data start to show that either inflation is not slowing as they expect it to, or if the labor market remains too tight,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group..Advertisement

1. First Text: ""inflation dynamic,"" ""stronger economic activity,"" ""soft landing,"" ""natural rate,"" ""rebalancing in the labor market""
2. Second Text: ""maximum employment,"" ""cumulative tightening,"" ""risks emerging,"" ""inflation expectations,"" ""interest rate paid on reserve balances""

Similarities:

1. Both texts focus on the goal of achieving an inflation rate of 2% over time and the necessary monetary policy measures to achieve that.
2. Both emphasize the attention the Committee gives to economic dynamics, specifically relating to inflation and employment.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The First Text emphasizes a more conversational analysis of the ongoing economic conditions and the future outlook, including personal impressions and experiences with inflation.
2. The Second Text presents a more formal and structured outline of monetary policy decisions and frameworks, emphasizing systemic oversight and commitment to policy goals.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The First Text provides detailed commentary on labor market dynamics, including discussions on the ""jobs worker gap"" and measures of economic activity, suggesting a holistic view of inflation impacts.
2. The Second Text focuses strictly on policy decisions, rates, and the mechanics of monetary policy implementation without delving into broader economic commentary.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The First Text includes phrases like ""stronger economic activity"" and ""soft landing,"" which reflect a qualitative assessment of economic conditions, while the Second Text uses terms like ""cumulative tightening"" and ""interest rate paid on reserve balances,"" which are more quantitative and technical in nature.
2. The Second Text's use of ""maximum employment"" implies a targeted state for employment metrics, whereas the First Text discusses ""rebalancing in the labor market,"" suggesting ongoing adjustment rather than a fixed state.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. This is evident in phrases that convey optimism about economic progress and inflation, such as ""it's a good thing that we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment"" and ""we're seeing that rebalancing in other places."" These sections suggest a sense of achievement and a constructive outlook on current conditions. In contrast, the second text emphasizes caution with phrases like ""the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks"" and ""Inflation remains elevated,"" reflecting a more neutral and cautious tone regarding the economic situation.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a higher level of certainty compared to the second text. This is illustrated through assertions such as ""So I guess I would point more to,"" ""It is certainly plausible,"" and ""It may, of course, be that the neutral rate has risen."" Such language indicates a strong confidence in the assessments being made. The second text, while asserting commitments and decisions, uses more conditional phrases like ""the Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy,"" which convey a more moderate level of certainty regarding future actions. This suggests a reliance on ongoing evaluation, marking it as less certain than the first text’s assertions.

1. First Text: stance, funds rate, neutral rate, economic activity, inflation dynamic, labor market, soft landing, rebalancing
2. Second Text: central bank, investor sentiment, revenue growth, margin expansion, interest rate hikes, GDP growth, higher-for-longer, political consequences

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the central bank's strategies and efforts to manage inflation, emphasizing the goal of returning to a target inflation rate of 2%.
2. They address the relationship between interest rates and economic factors, such as unemployment and economic growth, noting the effects of monetary policy on these variables.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the nuances and intricacies of inflation dynamics and the careful approach needed in decision-making, while the second text focuses on the broader economic implications for investors and market sentiment.
2. The second text places greater importance on the potential consequences of inflation management for upcoming political events, such as the 2024 presidential election, which is not mentioned in the first text.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides an in-depth discussion of the concepts of neutral rates and rebalancing in the labor market, while the second text offers a more general overview of the Fed's actions and the expectations surrounding them.
2. The second text includes specific forecasts for inflation, economic growth, and future Fed meetings, while the first text discusses these concepts more abstractly without providing precise forecasts.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""soft landing"" and ""rebalancing,"" which are specific to the context of economic adjustments, while the second text refers to ""higher-for-longer"" and ""political consequences,"" which relate more to market expectations and political outcomes.
2. The first text mentions ""funds rate"" and ""neutral rate,"" indicating a focus on interest rates in monetary policy, whereas the second text talks about ""investor sentiment"" and ""revenue growth,"" reflecting a broader economic context.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias through phrases that reflect a sense of progress and cautious optimism about the economy and inflation. For example, the speaker mentions ""We've been moving toward it"" and ""It is certainly possible that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than expected,"" which indicates a belief in positive economic momentum. In contrast, the second text is more focused on the challenges and uncertainties surrounding inflation, such as phrases like ""inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal"" and ""the inflation battle is a long way from finished,"" which conveys a more cautious and slightly negative sentiment.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text displays lower certainty in its assertions, as seen in phrases like ""we know it by its works,"" which reflects a level of uncertainty about the neutral rate and the economy's behavior. Additionally, the use of ""It may, of course, be that the neutral rate has risen"" suggests a lack of definitive conclusions. Conversely, the second text expresses a greater level of certainty, particularly in statements such as ""Traders widely expect the Fed to hold rates steady"" and ""Analysts will be closely analyzing these forecasts,"" which indicate clear expectations and more definitive insights about the Federal Reserve's actions."
2023-09-20 19:05:00,2023-09-20 19:10:00," continuing that trend. In terms of inflation, you are seeing the last three readings are very, very good readings. It's only three readings. You know, we were well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look at June, July and August, you're looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the good sector also to some extent in housing services and just a little in non-housing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think people should know that economic forecasting is very difficult and these are highly uncertain forecasts. But these are our forecasts. You know, we have very high quality people working on these forecasts and I think they stand up well against other forecasters. But just the nature of the businesses, the economy is very difficult to forecast. Given the forecast that you have, what justified not moving today and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in? Well, I think we have come very far, very fast in the rate increases that we've made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly and we did. And I think as we get closer to the rate that we think the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2% over time, you know, the risks become more to side it. And the risk of overtighting and the risk of under tightening that becomes more equal. And I think the natural common sense thing to do is as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it and that's what we're doing. So we're taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we sort of find our way to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2%. Jennifer. Thank you, Chair Powell, Jennifer Sean Berger with Yahoo Finance. With your focus on your over your PCE, isn't it true that base effects are huge and that by the time you meet in November, that it's more likely that you'll have a low PCE number that would make you feel more comfortable? And secondly, how would the lack of key indicators like CPI, the jobs report impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to have a government shutdown? Thank you. Sorry. I missed the first question. What was it miss? What's factors? The base factors. Base factors. Okay. So on that, we're looking at just monthly, you can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior months. So you're right, when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you could base factors. But we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data, again, we don't comment on government shutdowns. It's possible. If there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the next meeting, then it's possible we wouldn't be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get. And we would just have to deal with that. And I don't know. It's hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don't know about now. But it's certainly a reality that's a possibility. What would you feel more comfortable on the base effects that as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, would you feel uncomfortable at that point? You know, yes. I mean, if you're looking, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And that's what we're looking at. And month by month, what's the reading? And I think what we're really looking at is, there's a tendency to look at shorter and shorter maturities, but they're incredibly volatile and they can be misleading. That's why we look at 12 months. But I think in this situation where it looks like we've had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June, we're also looking at six months and even three months, but really six months inflation. So you're looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That's the right way to go. And we don't need to be in a hurry in getting to a conclusion about what to do. We can let the data evolve. So, thanks for the question. Chair Powell, Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We're seeing oil prices, as you mentioned, move up and that's pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not? Because the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we've seen the overall inflation is actually risen. Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer. This can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.

 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective September 21, 2023.","The central bank's effort to tame inflation has been a cornerstone of investor sentiment for much of 2023 and could suggest where stocks head for the rest of the year..Although inflation has eased significantly since then, it remains higher than the central bank's goal of 2%, raising questions about whether the improvement will be enough to convince the Fed to hold steady for now..Even though inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2% target, recent economic data will likely persuade the central bank to take a wait-and-see approach, experts said..""We look for Fed Chair Powell to stress that restrictive monetary policy has led to a notable cooling of economic activity, labor market momentum and inflation."".While the U.S. economy has certainly avoided a downturn for longer than many expected, the inflation battle is a long way from finished..With luck, the reported data will continue to be strong enough to avoid a downturn, but not so strong that inflation picks back up..After 11 interest rate hikes since March last year, inflation has fallen sharply but remains stuck stubbornly above the Fed's long-run target of two percent per year -- keeping pressure on officials to consider further policy action..Despite rising slightly due to increased energy costs, inflation remains well below last year's peak, while economic growth remains robust and the unemployment rate sits close to record lows -- raising hopes the Fed can slow price increases without triggering a downturn..Analysts will be closely analyzing these forecasts for signs of whether policymakers continue signaling they expect interest rates to rise higher than current levels -- as they did in June -- and for how long they think rates should remain high to bring inflation firmly back down to target..Fed officials again emphasized that the central bank is “strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.” Officials deliberate monetary policy again at their two-day meeting next month, which concludes on November 1..‘A soft landing is a primary objective’
 Inflation has slowed steadily from its four-decade peak last June, and it could ease all the way to the Fed’s 2% target without a sharp uptick in unemployment — a scenario known as a “soft landing.” Or, inflation could eventually drift down to 2%, but with the economy slipping into a recession as unemployment rises..He said that officials determine whether the strength of GDP is “a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation.”
 Economists widely expect slower growth this year, rather than an economic slump..We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at core inflation, so the question is, how long will those higher prices sustain?”

 Inflation has slowed steadily from its four-decade peak last June, and it could ease all the way to the Fed’s 2% target without a sharp uptick in unemployment — a scenario known as a “soft landing.” Or, inflation could eventually drift down to 2%, but with the economy slipping into a recession as unemployment rises..Some Fed officials are optimistic they can pull off a soft landing, but the central bank has to contend with a number of uncertainties and economic headwinds in the coming months, including the resumption of student loan payments next month, rising energy costs threatening core inflation’s slowdown, consumer fatigue from high inflation and the delayed effects of previous rate hikes on the broader, real economy..Powell’s assessment of growth and rising energy prices
 So far, the economy has been remarkably resilient in the face of the Fed’s most aggressive inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s..He said that officials determine whether the strength of GDP is “a threat to our ability to get back to 2% inflation.”
 Economists widely expect slower growth this year, rather than an economic slump..We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at core inflation, so the question is, how long will those higher prices sustain?”

1. The first text focuses extensively on the intricacies and difficulties of economic forecasting and managing inflation, while the second text adopts a more formal tone presenting specific economic indicators and decisions made by the Federal Reserve.
2. The first text discusses individual factors influencing inflation forecasts, whereas the second text provides a broader overview of inflation and employment goals of the Federal Reserve.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text goes into detail about monthly readings of inflation and how different sectors (like housing and energy) impact rates, while the second text is more general about economic conditions and does not delve into specifics as deeply.
2. The first text mentions the potential impacts of government shutdowns on data and forecasts; the second text does not address government policies directly.

2023-09-20 19:10:00,2023-09-20 19:15:00," prices are one of the big things that affects consumer sentiment. It really comes down to how persistent, how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn't, energy prices mostly, mostly don't contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don't tell you much about where inflation is really going. However, we're well aware, though, that, you know, if an energy price is the increase and stay high, that'll have an effect on spending. And it may have an effect on consumer expectations of inflation and things like that. That's just things we have to monitor. So, on the consumer, they're putting more and more of this on their credit card. The consumer seeing, you know, a record credit spending, how long do you think that consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned about a debt bubble related to that? So, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that's why we tend to look through energy moves that we can see as short-term volatility. You know, we're turning to consumer credit. You know, of course, we watch that carefully. Consumer distress measures of distress among consumers where it historic lows quite recently, you know, after, during and after the pandemic, they're now moving back up to normal. We're watching that carefully. But at this point, these readings are not, they're not at troublingly high levels. They're just kind of moving back up to what was the typical in the pre-pandemic era. Hi, Jean Young with M&I Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve have risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed's view about what's been driving that increase in recent weeks and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations and how much to technical factors? So, you're right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I think it's always hard to say precisely, but it's, most people do a common decomposition of the increase and they'll, the view will be it's not, it's not mostly about inflation expectations. It's mostly about other things, you know, either term premium or real yields and it's hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone's got models that will give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers. So, but essentially, they're moving up because it's not because of inflation. It's because probably it'll probably have something to do with stronger growth. I would say more, more supply of treasuries, you know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense. Kyle Campbell, American banker, thank you for taking the questions. Just two on housing. You've said slower, shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed. But there's also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market. So, my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation both as it's measured and felt by the broader public hinges on housing supply? And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future? So, on the supply point, of course supply is very important over time in setting house prices and for that matter rents. And so supply is kind of structurally constrained. But in terms of where inflation is going in the near term though, as you obviously know, a lot of it is leases that are running off and then being resigned or released at a level that's not as high, it won't be that much higher. A year ago would have been much higher than it was a year before. Now it may be below or at the same level. So, as those leases are rolling over, we're seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins, how much is that affecting things, really? The second effect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that bubble of buying and then a lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market. I think we look at the, I would look at the lock-in, the idea being that people are in very low very low rate mortgages and",-0.0015633142261594,30,2023-09-20,True,False,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT September 20, 2023

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on September 20, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective September 21, 2023.","The central bank's effort to tame inflation has been a cornerstone of investor sentiment for much of 2023 and could suggest where stocks head for the rest of the year..""While we don't know what the Fed will do going forward, cardholders' best move is to assume that rates will continue to rise and do what they can to knock down their credit card debt."".Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for Treasurys and Fed policy can also influence rates on home loans..If rising oil prices continue to boost transportation costs, other goods could also get more expensive, which may mean higher interest rates for longer..Despite rising slightly due to increased energy costs, inflation remains well below last year's peak, while economic growth remains robust and the unemployment rate sits close to record lows -- raising hopes the Fed can slow price increases without triggering a downturn..Powell’s assessment of growth and rising energy prices

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective September 21, 2023.","The central bank's effort to tame inflation has been a cornerstone of investor sentiment for much of 2023 and could suggest where stocks head for the rest of the year..""While we don't know what the Fed will do going forward, cardholders' best move is to assume that rates will continue to rise and do what they can to knock down their credit card debt."".Investors' expectations for future inflation, global demand for Treasurys and Fed policy can also influence rates on home loans..If rising oil prices continue to boost transportation costs, other goods could also get more expensive, which may mean higher interest rates for longer..Despite rising slightly due to increased energy costs, inflation remains well below last year's peak, while economic growth remains robust and the unemployment rate sits close to record lows -- raising hopes the Fed can slow price increases without triggering a downturn..Powell’s assessment of growth and rising energy prices

2023-11-01 18:30:00,2023-11-01 18:35:00," Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We have raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. The stance of policy is restrictive, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and well above earlier expectations. In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer spending. After picking up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Employment remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 3.4 percent over the 12-month sending in September, excluding the volatile food and energy categories core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent. Inflation is moderated since the middle of last year, and readings over the summer work quite favorable. But a few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-ankored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.

 While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target..A red-hot economy could make the proverbial final mile of the Fed’s historic inflation fight more difficult, and possibly undo some of the welcome progress it has seen over the past year..“Everyone’s been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of a rate-hiking cycle like this one,” Powell said..The Fed chief stressed that it “is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely” that the central bank would need to see weaker growth and a softer job market to “fully restore price stability.” It’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown..The good news for the Fed is that the economy is widely expected to lose some steam under the weight of higher borrowing costs due to elevated yields, tighter budgets due to the resumption of student loan repayments, depleted pandemic savings and other economic hurdles Americans are facing..The Fed’s several past policy statements have all mentioned that tighter credit conditions will likely weigh on both inflation and the broader economy, but Wednesday’s statement included “financial” conditions in that usual sentence..“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note..The spotlight on Wednesday will meanwhile firmly be on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, with the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady..Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand..""We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor,"" Powell said, adding that such growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk."".Advertisement
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the afternoon that the central bank still isn't sure its main interest rate is high enough to ensure high inflation will move down to its 2% target..The jump in yields has already brought the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to nearly 8%, for example, “and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists."".Advertisement

 WASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting — the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The combination of sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth and decelerating inflation has raised hopes the Fed can pull off a so-called soft landing — raising rates just enough to contain price increases without tipping the economy into recession.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: dual mandate, maximum employment, stable prices, FOMC, policy firming, nominal wage growth, PCE prices, purchasing power
2. Second Text: federal funds rate, tighter financial conditions, economic outlook, voting for monetary policy action, primary credit rate, operational tools, implication for monetary policy

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and control inflation at a target rate of 2 percent.
2. Both emphasize the importance of assessing economic indicators and the impact of current monetary policy decisions on inflation and economic activity.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text shares a tone of urgency regarding the need to control inflation and its impact on the populace, while the second text is more procedural and focused on monetary policy decisions and implications.
2. The first text discusses specific economic indicators (like GDP growth, job gains, and wage growth) in detail, while the second text primarily focuses on the Federal Reserve’s operational decisions related to interest rates.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a detailed analysis of recent economic conditions, including employment statistics and inflation measures, whereas the second text outlines decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee without delving deeply into economic performance specifics.
2. The first text describes the challenges posed by inflation more thoroughly, while the second text emphasizes the implications of maintaining the federal funds rate and less on inflation's impact on individuals.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms such as ""sustainable inflation,"" ""tight monetary policy,"" and ""longer-run goal,"" which emphasize the Federal Reserve's focus on economic stability and employment; the second text incorporates more technical terms like “reserve balances” and “open market operations” relating to the Fed’s operational practices.
2. The first text refers to ""labor market conditions"" and ""inflation expectations"" in a broader context of economic health, whereas the second text specifically mentions ""financial and credit conditions"" in relation to economic activity.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text contains phrases that emphasize commitment and optimism about achieving economic goals and controlling inflation, such as ""we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal"" and ""strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers."" These statements foster a sense of positive engagement with the challenges faced. In contrast, the second text adopts a more neutral tone, stating straightforwardly, ""Inflation remains elevated"" and ""Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,"" which conveys a recognition of challenges without the same proactive or hopeful language. This suggests a slight emotional bias towards positivity in the first text compared to the more neutral tone of the second.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text showcases a strong confidence in monetary policy actions and their potential impacts, as evidenced by lines such as ""we are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses"" and ""we will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming."" The use of definitive language indicates a high level of assertiveness and certainty regarding their process and expectations. Conversely, the second text displays a more cautious and somewhat conditional language, for example, ""the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge,"" which reflects a lower level of certainty compared to the more assured tone observed in the first text. Therefore, the first text expresses a higher level of certainty about the effectiveness of their policy decisions.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

2. Second Text: policymakers, soft landing, interest rate decision, economic slowdown, financial conditions, borrowing costs, inflation fighters, robust consumer spending

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy and the current economic conditions.
2. Each text emphasizes the relationship between inflation, employment, and economic growth in the U.S.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on the Federal Reserve's commitment to its dual mandate and the specifics of monetary policy actions, reflecting a more formal and structured overview.
2. The second text highlights the market's reactions and expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, indicating a more speculative and analytical tone.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides detailed statistical analysis, such as specific rate increases and GDP growth rates, illustrating a comprehensive overview of the economy's performance.
2. The second text offers insights into market perceptions and potential impacts of Fed decisions on borrowers and savers, focusing more on investor expectations and forecasts.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""FOMC"" and ""core PCE prices,"" which are specific to monetary policy discussions.
2. The second text employs terms like ""soft landing"" and ""borrowing costs,"" which focus on market consequences and investor sentiment rather than policy specifics.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias through phrases that express commitment and dedication to addressing inflation and maintaining stable prices. For instance, it emphasizes a “strongly committed” attitude towards lowering inflation and mentions “recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace.” In contrast, the second text uses phrases like “concerns about upward pressure on inflation” and focuses on risks associated with economic strength, which reflects a more cautious tone about the future of the economy. The use of terms like ""soft landing"" in the second text reveals hope but is still framed within uncertainty, making it overall slightly less positive than the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits higher certainty as it lays out clear commitments, such as “we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal” and takes a definitive stance on monetary policy actions, asserting that “without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.” This level of assurance is contrasted by the second text, which includes phrases like “it’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown,” indicating significant uncertainty about the future economic trajectory. The repeated use of terms like “uncertain” and “it is still likely to be true” in the second text emphasizes a lower level of confidence in outcomes compared to the more assertive first text."

We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor. Evidence of growth persistently above potential or that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months driven by higher longer term bond yields among other factors. To us persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy. We monitor financial developments closely. In light of the uncertainties and risks and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook and for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Storing inflation is likely to require a period of below potential growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We get the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. It's going to Howard. Howard, Schneider with Reuters. Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this. To what you referenced the rise in long-term bond yields, to what degree did that supplant action by the Fed at this meeting? Thanks for your question. So I'll talk about bond yields, but I want to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we're looking at that. So if you look at the situation, let's look at the economy first. Inflation has been coming down, but it's still running well above our 2% target. The labor market has been rebalancing, but it's still very tight by many measures. GDP growth has been strong, although many forecasters are forecasting, and they have been forecasting that it will slow. As for the committee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time, and we're not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance. So that is the broader context into which this, the strong economy, and all the things I said, that's the context in which we're looking at this question of race. So obviously we're monitoring, we're attentive to the increase in longer-term yields, and which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer. As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the past monetary policy. In this case, the tighter financial conditions we're seeing from higher-long-term rates, but also from other sources like the stronger dollar and lower equity prices could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied. The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent, and that is something that remains to be seen. But that's critical. Things are fluctuating back and forth. That's not what we're looking for. With financial conditions, we're looking for persistent changes that are material. The second thing is that the longer-term rates that have moved up, they can't simply be a reflection of expected policy moves from us, that we would then, if we didn't follow through on them, then the rates would come back down. I would say on that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the increase in longer-term rates. In the meantime, though, perhaps the most important thing is that these higher-treatured yields are showing through the higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic equity.",-0.0020645957426612,32,2023-11-01,True,False,False,False,"In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the

 For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its key rate from near zero to roughly 5.4 per cent in its effort to tame inflation, which reached a four-decade high in 2022 as the economy roared out of the pandemic recession..Several of the Fed’s policy-makers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown – and, in process, ease inflation pressures – without the need for further rate hikes..“That’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve.”

 “Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months,” Powell said..“Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.”
 While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target..Looking for ‘below-trend growth’
 Fed officials have said they need to see consistent “below-trend growth” to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%, since red-hot demand could be maintaining some upward pressure on prices..The Fed chief stressed that it “is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely” that the central bank would need to see weaker growth and a softer job market to “fully restore price stability.” It’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown..The Fed’s several past policy statements have all mentioned that tighter credit conditions will likely weigh on both inflation and the broader economy, but Wednesday’s statement included “financial” conditions in that usual sentence..“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note..Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand..Advertisement

1. First Text: ""sufficiently restrictive"", ""long-term bond yields"", ""maximum employment and price stability goals"", ""cumulative tightening of monetary policy"", ""restoring price stability""
2. Second Text: ""elevated inflation"", ""tight financial and credit conditions"", ""maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent"", ""assess additional information"", ""primary credit rate""

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's commitment to managing inflation at a target rate of 2%.
2. Both texts emphasize the implications of financial conditions on economic activity and policy decisions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The First Text emphasizes the careful decision-making process and monitoring of economic data, whereas the Second Text takes a more formal and procedural tone with an emphasis on actions taken.
2. The First Text elaborates on the impacts of higher long-term bond yields, while the Second Text focuses on the effects of tighter financial and credit conditions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The First Text provides a more detailed analysis of economic conditions and requires a cautious approach to policy adjustments, whereas the Second Text outlines decisions more succinctly without deep elaboration on economic context.
2. The First Text discusses the need for time and potential consequences of policy on employment and growth, while the Second Text simply states the objectives of the committee without contextual emphasis.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The First Text uses terms like ""persistently changes in financial conditions"" and ""monitoring economic developments,"" which are more qualitative in nature. In contrast, the Second Text uses more technical terms like ""credit conditions"" and ""primary credit rate,"" which reference specific monetary policy tools.
2. The First Text refers to ""market conditions"" and ""labor market conditions,"" while the Second Text does not mention labor specifics, focusing instead on ""international developments"" as part of its broader assessment.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive sentiment compared to the second text, primarily due to its emphasis on commitment and attention to economic health. Phrases such as ""We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive"" and ""We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses"" reflect a proactive engagement with the economy that suggests optimism about the outcomes of their policies. In contrast, the second text presents a more neutral tone with phrases like ""Inflation remains elevated"" and ""All in all, tighter financial and credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity,"" which indicate concern without an uplifting outlook. 

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a higher level of certainty compared to the second text. The use of assertive language, such as ""we are committed,"" “we monitor financial developments closely,” and “we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting” shows strong confidence in their approach to monetary policy. In contrast, the second text employs more tentative language with phrases like ""the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge,"" which introduces uncertainty. This reflects a cautious approach, suggesting that while there is a plan, it is contingent on future developments, hence lower certainty in the overall stance.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's decision regarding interest rates and its impact on inflation and the economy.
2. They both emphasize the importance of monitoring financial conditions and the implications for future monetary policy adjustments.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text takes a more technical and in-depth examination of monetary policy and its implications, focusing on the nuances of economic indicators and data analysis.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides extensive detail on the policy considerations and potential risks related to inflation and financial conditions, suggesting a careful approach to future rate changes.
2. The second text encapsulates a broader perspective on public sentiment and market expectations without delving deeply into the specific mechanics of monetary policy.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terminology such as ""restrictive monetary policy"" and ""meeting by meeting decisions,"" which indicates a focused approach to policy adaptations.
2. The second text includes phrases like ""rate hikes"" and ""credit conditions,"" which are more accessible and reflect public and market-oriented discussions regarding interest rate decisions.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a more assertive commitment to achieving monetary policy goals, summarized in phrases like ""We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal"" and ""Restoring price stability is essential."" These phrases reflect a proactive stance and infused optimism regarding the plans to manage inflation and criteria for economic health. In contrast, the second text adopts a slightly more cautious tone, with an emphasis on monitoring and potential risks, using phrases such as ""it will make upcoming moves based on what data say about inflation and the job market."" This demonstrates a more wait-and-see attitude, lending it a somewhat more neutral or slightly negative tint compared to the first text’s commitment to action.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text displays strong confidence in the Federal Reserve's strategies and directions, especially in the phrase ""we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive."" This conveys a high level of assurance in the Fed's approach towards managing inflation. On the other hand, the second text contains multiple instances of uncertainty, as seen in ""though possibly keep the door open to further rate hikes"" and ""it’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown."" These phrases reflect a moderate level of certainty, indicating that while there is an expected path, the outcomes rely on various factors that are yet to be fully understood. Hence, the first text thus presents a higher level of certainty compared to the second text."

So that's how I would answer your question. Just a quick follow-on to be clear on this. In your opening statement, and just now, you seem to apply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions are restrictive enough to finish the fight. Is that true? Yes, that's exactly right. To say it a different way, we haven't made any decisions about future meetings. We have not made a determination. And we're not confident at this time that we've reached such a stance. We're not confident that we haven't. We're not confident that we have. And that's the way we're going to be going into these future meetings is to be just determining the extent of any additional further policy tightening that may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% at a time. So, I'm going to ask you a question. I'm going to ask you a question. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I wonder if you don't raise interest rates in December. Would the presumption be that at that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak? Or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year? And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause? So, let me start by saying we haven't made a decision about this. We haven't made a decision about September. You're asking a hypothetical there. But we're going into this several meeting. We'll get, as you know, two more inflation readings, two more labor market readings, some data on economic activity. And so we'll be taking, and also the broader situation, the broader financial condition situation, and broader world situation. We'll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December. We haven't made that decision. I would say, though, that the idea that if you would, the idea that you wouldn't, would, would difficult to, to raise again after stopping for a meeting or two, it's just not right. I mean, the committee will always do what, what it thinks is appropriate at the time. And again, we haven't made any decisions about, at all, about December. We didn't even, we didn't talk about making a decision in December today. Really, it was a decision for this meeting and, and understanding broader things. Nick. Nick. Nick Timmeros of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell did the Fed staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today's meeting. And how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening is persistent? You would say it was worth maybe a quarter point when we had the bank failures in the spring. What is it here on something that's presumably more straightforward and more familiar to simulate? So I guess I don't want to answer your question about the, about the recession, but the answer is no. I think I have to answer it since we, since we did publicly say in the minutes, you'll know anyway in the minutes, the staff did not put our session back in. I mean, it would be hard to see how you would do that. If you look at the, look at the activity we've seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term. In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it's, it's just too early to be doing that. And the main reason is we just don't know how persistent this will be. You can see how volatile it is. Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates. I think any kind of an estimate that was, you know, precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly. So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have, have clearly tightened. And you can see that in the rates that, that consumers and households and businesses are paying now. And over time that will have an effect. We just don't know how persistent it's going to be. And it's tough to try to translate that, you know, way that I'd be comfortable communicating into how many rate hikes that is. The type of follow-up, I guess, what makes you confident that the tighter, what makes you confident that tighter financial conditions will slow above trend growth when 500 basis points of rate hikes, QT and a minor banking crisis have not thus far. Well, I just, that that's, you know, the way our policy works is, and sometimes it works with lags, of course, which can be long and variable. But ultimately, if you raise the, you know, raise interest rates, you do see the, if those effects, and you see those effects in the economy now, you see what's happening in the housing market, you're seeing that now. You'll see, if you look at surveys of people, it's not a good time, they think to buy durable goods of various kinds, because rates are so high now. I mentioned, again, we're getting reports from housing that the effects of this, of this could be quite significant. But you're right, this has been a resilient economy, and it's, I think, been surprising in its resilience, and there are, there are a number of possible reasons why that may be.

 WASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting — the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The combination of sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth and decelerating inflation has raised hopes the Fed can pull off a so-called soft landing — raising rates just enough to contain price increases without tipping the economy into recession..The general sense I’m getting is that the Fed may be done hiking but they’re going to keep rates high for a while.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: tightening persists, financial conditions, bank failures, economic activity, broader financial condition situation
2. Second Text: elevated inflation, target range for the federal funds rate, cumulative tightening of monetary policy, reductions of Treasury securities, primary credit rate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the impact of financial conditions on economic activity and the potential need for monetary policy adjustments.
2. Both emphasize the importance of inflation rates in determining future monetary policy decisions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on uncertainty regarding future interest rate decisions and the current state of financial conditions, emphasizing ongoing evaluations.
2. The second text adopts a more formal tone, outlining specific monetary policy decisions and established targets, signifying confidence in the actions being taken.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides more conversational insights into the Fed's decision-making process and discussions around potential scenarios, while the second text offers more structured data detailing specific decisions and actions.
2. The second text provides quantitative information on rates and policy actions, whereas the first text is more qualitative, discussing implications and uncertainties.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text includes phrases such as ""we haven’t made a decision,"" reflecting a more tentative or exploratory language, while the second text uses terms like ""voted unanimously"" indicating decidability and clarity.
2. The second text introduces specific terms related to operational monetary policy tools (e.g., ""reinvest,"" ""open market operations""), which are less emphasized in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text reflects a slightly more negative emotional bias primarily through expressions of uncertainty and concern about the economic outlook. Phrases like ""we're not confident at this time"" and ""it's just too early to be doing that"" convey a sense of doubt and hesitation regarding financial conditions and policy decisions. In contrast, the second text maintains a more neutral or slightly positive tone with phrases like ""the Committee will continue to assess additional information"" and ""the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy,"" which suggest a proactive approach and openness to adaptation without the same level of concern or uncertainty present in the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits lower certainty, highlighted by repeated phrases expressing indecision and lack of confidence, such as ""we haven't made any decisions"" and ""we just don't know how persistent this will be."" This language indicates significant uncertainty about future policy directions. Conversely, the second text demonstrates higher certainty in its intentions, stating ""the Committee decided to maintain the target range"" and ""the Committee will continue to monitor the implications,"" showcasing a clear stance and confidence in their decision-making process—which is less prevalent in the first text.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and the decision to maintain current rates amidst economic conditions.
2. Both texts focus on the implications of inflation and financial conditions affecting future rate increases.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the uncertainty and conditions surrounding future rate decisions, highlighting concerns about financial conditions, whereas the second text focuses on the overall health of the economy and the prospect of achieving a soft landing.

2. The first text delves into hypothetical scenarios regarding rate increases and meeting conclusions, whereas the second text presents a more predictive analysis of the Fed's actions based on current economic data.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text includes terms like ""decision about Sept,"" ""resilient economy,"" and ""simulate,"" while the second text introduces phrases like ""underlying strength of the economy"" and ""meeting by meeting.""
2. The first text refers to the immediate implications of ongoing financial conditions while the second text discusses broader economic projections such as ""soft landing"" and ""rate-hiking campaign.""","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text reflects a nuanced sense of uncertainty and caution regarding financial conditions and future interest rate decisions. Phrases such as ""we're not confident at this time that we've reached such a stance"" and ""we haven't made any decisions about future meetings"" convey a lack of optimism and a focus on potential adverse outcomes. This contrasts with the second text, which includes phrases like ""the combination of sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth and decelerating inflation has raised hopes"" and communicates a more positive sentiment around the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve a ""soft landing."" Overall, the first text's emphasis on uncertainty and lack of confidence positions it as slightly more negative compared to the more hopeful tone of the second text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a considerable level of uncertainty, as indicated by phrases such as ""it's just too early to be doing that"" and ""I think any kind of an estimate that was... would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly."" These statements express doubt and a lack of definitive answers, signaling lower certainty in the speaker's assertions. In comparison, the second text presents a clearer perspective, with terms like ""the Federal Reserve is widely predicted"" and ""the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for,"" suggesting a moderate level of confidence in the Federal Reserve's policies and future outcomes. This discrepancy highlights the first text's lower certainty compared to the more assured tone of the second text."

It is sufficiently restrictive. That's really our focus. Great. And just one quick thing. You last month had gone to York, Pennsylvania, where you talked to a lot of, or yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot of small business owners. Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you picked up on? And was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about? I wouldn't say I was terribly surprised. I was very impressed by York as a town with a real strategy. And I would say it's very impressive what the people there have put together in the face of some difficult longer run trends about offshoreing of manufacturing and that kind of thing. They've done a great job as a city, I think. What you hear is consistent there, which is people are really suffering under high inflation. You were there. We talked to some people who were feeling that in their businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well. It's painful for people, particularly people who don't have a lot of extra financial resources who are spending most of their incoming income on the essentials of life. So we know that. That wasn't new, but that did come through very clearly in the conversations we had in New York. I walked away from that and even just thinking that the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability, fully restore price stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage we can. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. You've spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get inflation down, but since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, how have you changed your views on that at all on how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall growth? Well, I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we've been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one. So that's historically unusual and very welcome result. And the same is true of growth. We've been saying that we need to see below potential growth and growth has been strong, but yet we're still seeing this. I think I still believe, and my colleagues for the most part, I think still believe that it is likely to be true. It is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market, in labor market conditions, to get to fully restore price stability. But it's only a good thing that we haven't seen. And I think we know why. Since we lifted off, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here, one of which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand from the pandemic and response to the pandemic. And the other is restrictive monetary policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover, time in space to recover. So you see, those two forces now working together to bring down inflation. But it's that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth. It's just supply side improvements like shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away. It's getting a significant increase in the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration. That's a big supply side gain that is really helping the economy. It's part of why GDP is so high, is because we're getting that supply. So we welcome that. But I think those things will run their course and we're probably still going to be left we think. And I think we'll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability. And that's where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important. Against that backdrop, if you've gotten any clarity on lags, if you have an economy that's been so resilient to high rate increases, does that suggest to you that there isn't necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and that it may have already come into effect? You know, I continue to think it's very hard to say. So it's been one year at this meeting. One year ago, this was the fourth of our 75 basis points. So that's",0.0011196874404422,34,2023-11-01,True,False,False,False,"Inflation remains elevated..Tighter financial and credit conditions

 With no new interest rate projections or economic forecasts released this meeting, all eyes will be on Powell and his comments on the outlook for monetary policy..Powell, speaking on October 19, noted that the economy is a story of ""much stronger demand"" and that it ""may just be that rates haven't been high enough for long enough."".Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell answers a question at a press conference following a closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2023..Powell spoke on the state of the central bank's holdings of cash and bonds after a meeting in which officials again held their overnight interest rate target range steady at between 5.25% and 5.5%, the same level it's been since the end of July..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..At a new conference Wednesday, Powell will likely highlight the progress the central bank has made while still underscoring that inflation remains too high and that future rate hikes might be needed to finish the job of slowing inflation to the Fed’s 2 per cent target..“The Fed has to talk tough on inflation,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors..Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low..“It’s clearly a tightening in financial conditions,” Powell said this month..And Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board, said last month, “I believe we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive moves” on interest rates..Economists and financial markets had expected the pause in the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, after several Fed officials signaled they anticipate a further slowing of the US economy as it continues to absorb the effects of higher borrowing costs..The Fed’s post-meeting statement noted that “economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter” — a recent development that has puzzled some economists..Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference that the central bank is keeping a close eye on soaring bond yields, which “could matter for future rate decisions.”
 “Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months,” Powell said..“Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.”
 While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target..“Everyone’s been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of a rate-hiking cycle like this one,” Powell said..The Fed chief stressed that it “is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely” that the central bank would need to see weaker growth and a softer job market to “fully restore price stability.” It’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown..The good news for the Fed is that the economy is widely expected to lose some steam under the weight of higher borrowing costs due to elevated yields, tighter budgets due to the resumption of student loan repayments, depleted pandemic savings and other economic hurdles Americans are facing..“Wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months, where they are substantially closer to a level that would be consistent with 2% inflation over time,” Powell said..“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note..“Looking ahead, we foresee softer labor market conditions with further hiring freezes and strategic resizing decisions along with some continued moderation in nominal wage growth,” she wrote..Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized to gauge where interest rates are headed and how long they will stay higher..“Chairman Powell will also argue that the lagged effects of past hikes have not fully impacted the economy and that patience is prudent,” Weisman said..Once bemoaned as a source of recession worries, the U.S. economy has become a wellspring of good news: blistering growth, robust hiring and consumers opening their wallets for everything from concert tickets to bar tabs..Speaking at a luncheon in New York City last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the unexpectedly strong economic performance in recent months..""We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor,"" Powell said, adding that such growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk."".“It makes no sense to me why you cannot reduce the balance sheet at the same rate you have increased it.”
 Scott also asked if the Fed would move to a more “proactive” stance of balance sheet reduction..""Data continues to show consumer strength and broader economic strength in the U.S. and against that, is the long end of the curve, which is to some extent acting like rate hikes."".Advertisement
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the afternoon that the central bank still isn't sure its main interest rate is high enough to ensure high inflation will move down to its 2% target..“Slowing down is giving us a better sense of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.”

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of inflation and its impact on the economy.
2. Both emphasize the importance of monetary policy and its implications for economic growth and stability.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on personal anecdotes and insights from small business owners, reflecting their experiences with inflation, while the second text presents a more formal and structured assessment of economic indicators and policy decisions.
2. The first text discusses the sentiments of individuals and specific localities (like York, Pennsylvania), whereas the second text takes a broader view, addressing nationwide economic conditions and considerations for federal policy.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text includes detailed conversations and qualitative impressions regarding inflation, as well as specific discussions around labor market conditions and local economies. The second text, in contrast, summarizes quantitative indicators and broader economic implications without individual stories.
2. The second text provides specific numerical targets for inflation (e.g., aiming for a 2% inflation rate) and details on policy decisions. The first text does not present such explicit target figures or detailed policy measures.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""unemployment,"" ""distortions,"" and ""offshoring"" reflecting a more qualitative economic discussion, while the second text includes more technical terms like ""policy firming,"" ""monetary policy implementation,"" and ""open market operations.""
2. The phrase ""tighter financial and credit conditions"" appears only in the second text, emphasizing the impact of credit availability, which is not discussed in the first text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a sense of optimism and progress regarding the economy, as evidenced by phrases like ""strong economy,"" ""great job,"" and ""real strategy."" The speaker reflects positively on the resilience of the labor market and mentions that there has been ""pretty significant progress on inflation,"" which suggests a constructive outlook. In contrast, the second text is more reserved, acknowledging the elevated inflation and ""tighter financial and credit conditions,"" which evokes a slightly more cautionary tone. The phrases in the second text do not inspire the same level of confidence, as it highlights potential risks and uncertainties in economic activity, making it appear slightly more negative in comparison.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a higher level of certainty with phrases such as “I still believe,” “it is still likely to be true,” and detailing specific outcomes like the positive developments in the labor market. The use of confident language suggests a reliance on observable trends and outcomes. The second text, however, employs a more cautious tone when discussing monetary policy implications, using terms like “likely to weigh” and “the Committee will take into account,” which indicates a moderate level of confidence but acknowledges uncertainties.

2023-11-01 18:55:00,2023-11-01 19:00:00," That's a full year since then. I think we are seeing the effects of all the hiking we did last year and this year we're seeing it. It's very hard to know exactly what that might be. But you can, for example, an example of where you wouldn't have felt this yet is debt that had been termed out. But it's going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after. So, and there are little things like that where the effects are just taking time to get into the economy. I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the legs are. I think trying to make a clear answer and say, I'm just going to assume this is a really not a good way to do it. And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy. And it takes time. We know that. And you can't rush it. So, slowing down is giving us, I think, a better sense of how much more we need to do if we need to do more. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I'm trying to connect the dots here. One quick clarification I want to ask about Rachel's question is you said you need slower growth. You had always said before a period of lower than trend growth has that changed. And two, it sounds to me like you're basically saying here that the kind of the dot plots out the window that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase for right now doesn't matter about the turn of the year. And that there's not an objective way to determine whether or not you've got enough tightening in the system. It's just going to be a subjective judgment meeting by meeting. Well, so let's talk about the dot plot first. So the dot plot is a picture in time of what the people in the committee thinks is likely to be a appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast. In principle, when things change, that's not like a plan that anybody's agreed to or that we will do. That's a forecast that would change, for example. I mean, many things could change that would cause people to say I wouldn't write down that dot six weeks later. I think of the number of things that could change your mind on that. So I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three months period between that meeting and the next meeting. But nonetheless, it's out there and we don't. We do personally update our forecast, but we don't formally update the dot plot. So I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we're thinking about these things. We're laying out there, our thinking, and as we approach the meeting, my colleagues and I will be talking about how we're processing that data. In terms of, so we're not really changing the way, in terms of growth, what I said was below potential. So what you have here recently is growth that is temporarily, potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level. So the right way to think about it is what's potential growth this year. People think trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2%, or I would say just around 2%. But what we've had is with the improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, through both participation and immigration and with the better functioning in the labor market and with unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things, you're seeing actually elevated potential growth. There's catch-up growth that can happen in potential. And that means that if you're growing, you could be growing it 2% this year and still be growing, growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy. I hope that's clear. That's really what's going on. That's why I would say it as below potential. But if you could clarify what I asked about meeting by meeting, we essentially now supposed to assume that it's a meeting by meeting, live meeting with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at each meeting. I don't know that I want to just accept anybody's characterization. I'll tell you how we're doing this. So we're going meeting by meeting. We're asking ourselves whether we've achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time. That's the question we're asking. We're looking at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions and all of those things that we look at. And then we've come very far with this rate hiking cycle, very far. And you saw the spread at the September meeting of, you know, it's a relatively small spread of people think one or two additional hikes. So you're close to the end of the cycle.",0.0026515800494955,35,2023-11-01,True,True,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT November 1, 2023

 For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low..Several of the Fed’s policy-makers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown – and, in process, ease inflation pressures – without the need for further rate hikes..“That’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve.”
 Though the Fed has raised its benchmark rate to a 22-year high, it hasn’t imposed any hikes since July..And Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board, said last month, “I believe we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive moves” on interest rates..Economists and financial markets had expected the pause in the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, after several Fed officials signaled they anticipate a further slowing of the US economy as it continues to absorb the effects of higher borrowing costs..The Fed’s post-meeting statement noted that “economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter” — a recent development that has puzzled some economists..Despite the Fed aggressively raising interest rates 11 times since March 2022 in a bid to combat inflation, the US economy has not only avoided a recession so far, but instead expanded at a blistering 4.9% annualized rate in the third quarter, mostly due to solid consumer spending..“Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.”
 While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target..A red-hot economy could make the proverbial final mile of the Fed’s historic inflation fight more difficult, and possibly undo some of the welcome progress it has seen over the past year..Looking for ‘below-trend growth’
 Fed officials have said they need to see consistent “below-trend growth” to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%, since red-hot demand could be maintaining some upward pressure on prices..“Everyone’s been very gratified to see that we’ve been able to achieve pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of a rate-hiking cycle like this one,” Powell said..The Fed chief stressed that it “is still likely to be true, not a certainty, but likely” that the central bank would need to see weaker growth and a softer job market to “fully restore price stability.” It’s unclear if inflation can continue to slow without those two areas showing a consistent slowdown..The good news for the Fed is that the economy is widely expected to lose some steam under the weight of higher borrowing costs due to elevated yields, tighter budgets due to the resumption of student loan repayments, depleted pandemic savings and other economic hurdles Americans are facing..“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note..“Chairman Powell will also argue that the lagged effects of past hikes have not fully impacted the economy and that patience is prudent,” Weisman said..The move allows previous rate increases to take greater hold of the economy and grants the central bank time to assess whether another hike will be necessary..Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand..""Data continues to show consumer strength and broader economic strength in the U.S. and against that, is the long end of the curve, which is to some extent acting like rate hikes."".The jump in yields has already brought the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to nearly 8%, for example, “and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists."".“Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses,” it said, “are likely to weigh on economic activity.”
 That reference echoed recent comments by Fed officials that higher yields — or interest rates — on the 10-year Treasury note could impose a dampening impact on the economy, cool inflation and substitute for an additional rate hike by the Fed..Those tighter credit conditions, though, have yet to cool the economy or slow hiring as much as the Fed had expected..Several of the Fed’s policymakers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown — and, in process, ease inflation pressures — without the need for further rate hikes..The general sense I’m getting is that the Fed may be done hiking but they’re going to keep rates high for a while.","For release at 2:00 p.m. EDT November 1, 2023

 For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low..Several of the Fed’s policy-makers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown – and, in process, ease inflation pressures – without the need for further rate hikes..“That’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve.”

 For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low..Several of the Fed’s policy-makers have said they think those trends may contribute to an economic slowdown – and, in process, ease inflation pressures – without the need for further rate hikes..“That’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve.”

1. First Text: monetary policy under great uncertainty, hiking we did last year, subjective judgment meeting by meeting, catch-up growth, potential growth this year
2. Second Text: economic activity expanded, job gains have moderated, cumulative tightening of monetary policy, maintain the target range, implications for monetary policy

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of monetary policy and its impact on economic conditions.
2. Both texts emphasize the need for ongoing evaluations of economic data when considering changes to monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy decisions and the subjective nature of evaluations, whereas the second text presents a more structured and decisive view of maintaining interest rates and assessing policy implications.
2. The first text discusses potential economic growth and its complexities in relation to inflation, while the second text concentrates on concrete indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a nuanced discussion about how monetary policy affects the economy over time, highlighting the lag in effects and uncertainty, while the second text gives a more straightforward summary of recent economic indicators and the decision to maintain the current interest rate.
2. The first text delves into the implications of the dot plot and personal forecasts, whereas the second text discusses specific decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee with regards to monetary policy implementation.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""dot plot,"" ""subjective criteria,"" and ""below potential,"" which indicate a focus on the process and theory behind monetary policy, while the second text uses terms like ""target range,"" ""cumulative tightening,"" and ""unemployment rate"" that pertain to direct policy actions and economic indicators.
2. The first text mentions ""slow growth"" and ""meeting by meeting,"" suggesting a careful and gradual approach to policy adjustments, while the second text refers to ""economic activity expanded"" and ""maintain the target range,"" reflecting a more stable and assertive stance on current economic conditions.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text conveys a subtle negativity through its emphasis on uncertainty and caution. Phrases such as ""it's very hard to know exactly what that might be"" and ""under great uncertainty"" reflect a more pessimistic outlook regarding the effects of monetary policy and economic indicators. In contrast, the second text states, ""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity expanded at a strong pace,"" which has a more positive tone about economic growth. The direct mention of ""job gains have moderated"" with a subsequent but reassuring statement about the unemployment rate staying low can be seen as a balanced approach, offering a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower certainty level, demonstrated by phrases like ""we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty"" and ""it's just going to be a subjective judgment meeting by meeting."" This language indicates doubt and an acknowledgment of the unpredictable nature of economic outcomes. Meanwhile, the second text reflects a higher degree of certainty, particularly in the statement, ""The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent,"" demonstrating a clear and definitive action taken based on stronger economic indicators. This contrasting expression of assurance indicates that the second text has a higher certainty level compared to the first.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: monetary policy, dot plot, below potential growth, subjective judgment, rate hiking cycle
2. Second Text: soft landing, sturdy hiring, healthy economic growth, decelerating inflation, tighter credit conditions

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy and interest rates in the context of economic growth and inflation.
2. Each text highlights the uncertainty of the economic outlook and the need for careful consideration in policy decisions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the complexities and subjectivity in making monetary policy decisions, whereas the second text emphasizes the positive outlook of a potential ""soft landing"" for the economy.
2. The first text discusses technical aspects of the Fed’s decision-making process (like the dot plot), while the second text centers on recent economic performance indicators like hiring and growth.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a deeper exploration into the challenges faced by the Fed and the nuances of their planning, while the second text presents a broader overview of recent economic conditions without the same depth of analysis.
2. The first text reflects on the timeline of past monetary policy changes and their effects, while the second text emphasizes current conditions and predictions for the near future.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terminology like ""subjective judgment"" and ""meeting by meeting,"" which indicates a more cautious approach, while the second text mentions ""soft landing"" and ""sturdy hiring,"" which suggest a more optimistic outlook on the economy.
2. The first text refers to ""tightening"" in a monetary context, while the second text references ""tighter credit conditions,"" indicating a shift towards broader financial implications.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text presents a somewhat cautious and uncertain tone regarding the economic conditions and the implications of monetary policy decisions. Phrases such as ""it’s very hard to know exactly what that might be"" and ""we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty"" convey a sense of apprehension about the future effects on the economy. In contrast, the second text employs phrases like ""sturdy hiring,"" ""healthy economic growth,"" and ""has raised hopes"" which imply optimism regarding the economy's trajectory and the potential for a successful soft landing. This contrast in language highlights that the first text expresses a more cautious view than the second text, which leans towards positive expectations.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a lower level of certainty through phrases like ""I think"" and ""it takes time. We know that. And you can't rush it,"" which suggest hesitance in making definitive conclusions. In contrast, the second text showcases higher certainty with statements like ""the Fed can pull off a so-called soft landing"" and ""it hasn’t imposed any hikes since July,"" indicating more confidence in the Fed's ability to navigate economic challenges. This comparison shows that the first text’s language reflects a more uncertain outlook compared to the clearer affirmatives found in the second text."
2023-11-01 19:00:00,2023-11-01 19:05:00," That was an impression as of a belief, as of September. It's not a promise or a plan of the future. And so we're going into these meetings one by one. We're looking at the data. As I mentioned, we're also, you know, we're being careful. We're proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time. Monetary policy is restrictive. We see its effects, particularly in interest sensitive spending and other channels. So that's how I think about it. Neil. Thanks. I chair Powell, Neil Irwin with Axios. In light of the run-up in long-term yields, we've seen the last several weeks. Have you been in any consideration to the pace of your asset runoff program? And if there were a judgment that the higher term premium was endangering the dual mandate goals, would that be a reason to think about slowing or suspending QT, or should we think of that as more of a technical question around reserves? So the committee is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff. It's not something we're talking about or considering. And I know there are many candidate explanations for why rates have been going up. And QT is certainly on that list. It may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it's not, I think it's hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point. So that's not something that we're looking at right now. Victoria. Hi, Victoria, we know with Politico. I wanted to ask about the Basel 3 end game capital proposal. You've gotten a lot of pushback from people on different aspects of the proposal and you yourself expressed some reservations. And I'm just curious, could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes? So that proposal is out for comment. And we expect a lot of comment. We won't get those comments until the end of, or until well into next year. We've extended the deadline. And we'll take them seriously. We'll read them. I'll say what I do expect is that we will come to, we're a consensus driven organization. We'll come to a package that has broad support on the board. So these broad support mean more support than the proposal had? It means broad support. Janelle Marte with Bloomberg. So in addition to persistence, when you look at long-term treasury yields, what also are you watching to evaluate how those tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy? And if it will lessen the need for further tightening, also do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress? So what do we look at? We look at a very wide range of financial conditions. In fact, as you'll know, different organizations publish different financial conditions indexes, which can have seven or eight variables. So they can have 100 variables. So there's a very rich environment. And we tend to look at a few of them. I'm not going to give you the names, but there are a few of the common ones that people look at. And so they're looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates, the credit spreads. Sometimes they're pulling in credit availability and things like that. So it isn't any one thing. We would never look at, for example, long-term treasury rates in isolation. Nor will we ignore them. But we would look at them as part of a broader picture. And they do play a role, of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes. Your second question was on the banking stress? So it's something we're watching. As we did have, there were issues with interest rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in the March, the things we went through in March and thereafter. And so we've been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and that they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio unrealized losses that they have. We do think the banking system is quite resilient. We had a handful of bank failures. But so that's what we're out there doing. And we don't have any reason to think that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture, which is one of a strong banking system and one where there's a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity, on funding and those sorts of things.

1. First Text: impression, QT (quantitative tightening), balance sheet runoff, interest sensitive spending, banking stress, financial conditions indexes, resilience, liquidity, funding plans
2. Second Text: federal funds rate, monetary policy firming, inflation expectations, economic outlook, Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, primary credit rate, Open Market Desk

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the monetary policy tools and strategies used by the Federal Reserve to manage the economy.
2. Both emphasize the importance of monitoring economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, and financial conditions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses more on the discussions and meetings surrounding current economic conditions and specific questions related to monetary policy, while the second text has a more formal and technical tone outlining decisions and policy implementations.
2. The first text engages in a dialogue concerning the implications of long-term yields and banking stress, whereas the second text maintains a broader overview of the Fed's decision-making framework and quantitative metrics.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text includes conversational exchanges and specific inquiries regarding the impact of QT and bank resilience, providing a more detailed view of current economic concerns.
2. The second text has a procedural scope, detailing the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions and specific operational guidelines, which provides a clearer view of the Fed's policy implementation.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses colloquial phrases like ""we're being careful,"" reflecting a more cautious outlook, while the second text uses formal terms such as ""policy firming"" that indicate a structured approach.
2. The first text mentions ""interest sensitive spending"" and ""banking stress,"" while the second text refers specifically to ""federal funds rate"" and ""agency mortgage-backed securities,"" highlighting the focus of each text on different aspects of monetary policy.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text conveys a sense of caution and reservation, with phrases that reflect uncertainty about future actions and market conditions, such as ""it's not a promise or a plan of the future"" and ""we're being careful."" The repetition of the word ""carefully"" emphasizes a more defensive stance regarding monetary policy developments. In contrast, the second text presents a more straightforward and confident summary of the Federal Reserve's decisions, indicating a systematic approach with statements like ""the Committee decided to maintain the target range"" and ""the Committee will continue reducing its holdings,"" which convey a sense of proactive governance. The emotional undertone of the first text leans towards apprehension, whereas the second text sounds more assured.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty, indicated by phrases like ""we're looking at the data,"" ""it's something we're watching,"" and ""it's hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce."" These expressions of indecision and the acknowledgment of various candidate explanations for market behavior reflect a non-committal stance. Alternatively, the second text expresses high certainty through definitive statements such as ""the Committee would be prepared to adjust"" and ""the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously."" The structured and decisive language in the second text indicates a much firmer commitment to the outlined monetary policy strategies, highlighting a contrast in confidence levels between the two texts.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: dual mandate, QT, credit spreads, asset runoff, banking stress
2. Second Text: interest rate projections, economic forecasts, drawdown, financial conditions, inflation target

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's current approach to monetary policy and interest rates.
2. Each text references the impact of financial conditions and interest rates on the economy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the cautious approach of the Federal Reserve regarding monetary policy and the careful observation of financial conditions, presented in a more detailed conversational tone.
2. The second text focuses more on immediate market responses and future expectations for interest rates, with an emphasis on analysis and predictions, presented in a more formal reporting style.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text dives into specific discussions about the committee's considerations, including detailed questions about asset runoff and long-term yields.
2. The second text provides an overarching overview of market expectations and Powell's upcoming speech but lacks the granular detail on deliberations within the Fed regarding specific policies.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""banking stress"" and ""asset runoff,"" focusing on the internal considerations and challenges faced by banks and the Fed's strategy.
2. The second text includes phrases like ""interest rate projections"" and ""economic forecasts,"" indicating a broader market speculation context regarding the Fed's monetary policy.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similarly neutral  
Explanation: Both texts maintain a neutral tone throughout. The first text is characterized by cautious phrases such as ""we're proceeding carefully"" and ""that's not something that we're looking at right now,"" which offer a balanced approach without showing clear optimism or pessimism. The second text similarly presents a neutral overview of the Federal Reserve's situation, focusing on what is expected rather than providing subjective assessments. Phrases like “they are expected to keep rates steady” and “the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign” reflect a neutral stance as they relay information without emotional bias.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty  
Explanation: Both texts exhibit similar levels of certainty. The first text indicates a moderate level of confidence when stating, “the committee is not considering changing the pace of balance sheet runoff,” which shows a clear decision but acknowledges the complexity of the situation without overcommitting. Similarly, the second text notes, “the central bank is keeping a close eye on soaring bond yields,” displaying an awareness of ongoing developments while also conveying a consistent assessment of the Fed's stance. This indicates that both texts are grounded in present circumstances while simultaneously recognizing dynamic factors. Overall, there isn't a significant difference in levels of certainty between the two texts."

I'm just wondering how the Fed is monitoring these developments in the Middle East, you mentioned they are, and just what, you know, the potential economic impact could be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region. Thank you. I wouldn't want to speculate too much, but I'll just say so. You know, really the question there is, does the war spread more widely, and does it start to do things like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we're talking about? The price of oil has really not reacted very much so far to this. As the Fed, as the Federal Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about, to understand the economy and economic effects, and it isn't clear at this point that the conflict in the Middle East is going to, is on track to have significant economic effects. That doesn't mean it isn't incredibly important, and something for people to, you know, to take, take really important notice of, but it may or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an economic body. But the, what the Financial Stability Report does is it calls out risks, and that's what it's doing is calling out a risk of that. And the war in Ukraine is the same. The war in Ukraine, you know, did have immediately very significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities. So thank you.

 For the first time in nearly two years, the Federal Reserve is set Wednesday to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged for a second straight policy meeting – the clearest sign to date that the Fed is edging closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign..The Fed is standing pat, for now, in part because the economy has been moving mostly in the direction that Chair Jerome Powell has hoped for: Inflation has tumbled, even though hiring, consumer spending and economic growth have remained robust..Powell and other Fed officials are weighing two different trends as they consider their next moves: On the one hand, U.S. economic growth surged in the July-September quarter on the back of robust consumer spending, and hiring jumped in September, keeping the unemployment rate near a five-decade low..What’s important for the Fed is that the yield on the 10-year Treasury has continued to zoom higher even without rate hikes by the central bank..Powell has said the central bank can “proceed carefully” as it weighs the impact of the tighter credit on the healthy economy..And Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s governing board, said last month, “I believe we can wait, watch and see how the economy evolves before making definitive moves” on interest rates..Economists and financial markets had expected the pause in the Fed’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign, after several Fed officials signaled they anticipate a further slowing of the US economy as it continues to absorb the effects of higher borrowing costs..The Fed’s post-meeting statement noted that “economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter” — a recent development that has puzzled some economists..Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in his post-meeting news conference that the central bank is keeping a close eye on soaring bond yields, which “could matter for future rate decisions.”
 “Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months,” Powell said..“Because persistent changes in financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financial developments closely.”
 While inflation has retreated markedly from its four-decade peak last summer, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target..The good news for the Fed is that the economy is widely expected to lose some steam under the weight of higher borrowing costs due to elevated yields, tighter budgets due to the resumption of student loan repayments, depleted pandemic savings and other economic hurdles Americans are facing..The Fed’s several past policy statements have all mentioned that tighter credit conditions will likely weigh on both inflation and the broader economy, but Wednesday’s statement included “financial” conditions in that usual sentence..“Moderating wage growth, along with slower demand for goods and services, easing rent inflation and reduced pricing power should lead to further disinflation and argue in favor of the Fed holding the fed funds rate constant in the coming months,” wrote Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in an analyst note..The spotlight on Wednesday will meanwhile firmly be on the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, with the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady..Comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be scrutinized to gauge where interest rates are headed and how long they will stay higher..Ankur Banerjee and Lawrence White/Reuters

2023-12-13 19:30:00,2023-12-13 19:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. As we approach the end of the year, it's natural to look back on the progress that has been made toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high, ongoing progress and bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain. As we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that were fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Distoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. We've raised our policy interest rate by 5.25 percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace. Our actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt. Today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that we face, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from the outsized pace seen in the third quarter. Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 2.5% for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. After picking somewhat up over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our summary of economic projections, committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year, but expect growth to cool with a median projection falling to 1.4% next year. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand condition is continued to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. An employment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth appears to be easing and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8% at the end of this year to 4.1% at the end of next year. Employment has eased over the past year, but remains above our longer-run goal of 2%. Based on the consumer pricing index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in November, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1%. The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2%.

 The Fed has already yanked its main interest rate from nearly zero to more than 5.25%, its highest level since 2001, in hopes of slowing the economy and hurting investment prices by just the right amount: enough to snuff out high inflation but not so much that it causes a painful recession..It concludes another year of the Fed fighting to bring inflation down post-pandemic..The announcement comes just one day after the Federal Reserve received another promising sign of cooling inflation — the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, rose 3.1% year-over-year, down from October's reading of 3.2%..""Having come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced."".“Inflation has eased over the past year but remains over our longer run goal of 2%,” Powell said after the Fed’s 19-member policy committee ended its latest meeting..“We know that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.”
 At the same time, Powell suggested that while further rate hikes seem unlikely, the Fed’s policymakers will keep that option open in case of a resurgence of inflation..So far, the Fed has achieved what few observers had thought possible a year ago: Inflation has tumbled without an accompanying surge in unemployment or a recession, which typically coincide with a central bank’s efforts to cool the economy and curb inflation..Though inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has declined faster than Fed officials had expected, allowing them to keep rates unchanged and wait to see if price increases continue to ease..In its quarterly projections, the Fed’s policymakers now expect “core” inflation, according to its preferred measure, to fall to just 2.4% by the end of 2024, down from a 2.6% forecast in September..Still, in a statement it issued after its 19-member policy committee met Wednesday, the Fed said that “inflation has eased over the past year, but remains elevated.” It was the first time since inflation first spiked that the Fed has formally acknowledged progress in its fight against accelerating prices..Some Fed members have suggested that they are starting to ponder whether policy is now sufficiently restrictive to quell inflation, while others have argued that several more months of slowing price growth may be needed before a cut is justified..The likelihood that the Fed will assume a more hawkish outlook -- and ultimately choose to keep rates higher for a longer period of time -- was bolstered by inflation data earlier this week which showed that consumer price growth, while cooling due in part to falling fuel costs, is still sticky..Easing inflation back down to its 2% target has been the central objective of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, and policymakers will need to be confident that prices are on a downward trajectory towards that mark before rolling out a potential policy pivot..Federal Reserve Signals Upcoming Rate Cuts as Inflation Eases
 Quiver Quantitative - In a significant turn of events, the Federal Reserve has signaled a shift in its monetary policy, leaning towards rate cuts in the coming year as inflation appears to be heading towards the central bank's 2% target..Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during the meeting further reinforced this shift in focus, suggesting that while the Fed remains prepared to hike rates if necessary, the primary concern is now when to implement rate reductions as inflation eases..Market Overview: -Fed holds rates steady but pivots to dovish tone, forecasting rate cuts in 2024..Looking Ahead: -The Fed's pivot from hiking to easing marks a turning point in the fight against inflation..The Fed’s projections also include lowered inflation forecasts and slightly reduced economic growth expectations for the coming year, while unemployment projections remain stable..The Fed's readiness to pivot, following a substantial 5.25 percentage point hike in rates, reflects the recent deceleration in price pressures and a cooling labor market..Comments from Governor Christopher Waller, a staunch supporter of the Fed’s inflation-taming measures, have fueled speculation about the central bank's readiness to lower rates as inflation subsides..And what’s the message for the Fed?.All of this, coupled with diminishing inflation, suggests it’s finally time for the Fed to take its foot off the brakes and gingerly nudge the accelerator.","For release at 2:00 p.m. EST December 13, 2023

 Will the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate some time next year – and, if so, by how much?.Speaking recently at Spelman College in Atlanta, the Fed chair cautioned that “it would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to fully defeat inflation..“We need to be focused on what the Fed - and ECB - are going to say, and what pushback to current pricing we’ll get..Such a decision would match the choice made by the Fed at its most recent meeting in September, when the central bank paused its inflation fight amid growing optimism that the U.S. could achieve normal price levels without falling into a recession..In recent months, mixed signals from the economy have complicated the Fed's effort to bring down inflation while averting a recession, an outcome known as a ""soft landing."".While mixed economic data creates significant uncertainty, the status of the Fed's inflation fight remains clear, Powell said, noting that the task will require a further slowdown in price increases..Easing inflation in 2023 has raised hopes for a gentler Federal Reserve and a strong stock market in 2024..“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.”
 But any additional rate increases aren’t reflected in futures..“The Fed is feeling increasingly comfortable that the economy, jobs and inflation are all moving in the right direction, consistent with the current federal funds rate,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN..“I’m thinking about whether we have enough tightening in the system and are sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability.”

It states, ""the path forward is uncertain,"" and ""we will make decisions about the extent of any additional policy firming based on the totality of the incoming data,"" signaling an awareness of unpredictability in future outcomes. This moderate stance reflects confidence in the current strategy while recognizing existing uncertainties. On the other hand, the second text conveys a lower level of certainty, particularly when it states, ""it would be premature to conclude with confidence"" and highlights ""mixed signals from the economy have complicated the Fed's effort."" This positioning indicates hesitation and a lack of assurance in the Fed's ability to control inflation fully, showcasing a more tentative approach to future policy decisions compared to the first text's moderate certainty."

The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation. We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25 percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than a trillion dollars. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We're committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation standably down to 2% over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is on a path to that objective. In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward. While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6% at the end of 2024, 3.6% at the end of 2025, and 2.9% at the end of 2026 still above the median longer term rate. These projections are not a committee decision or plan. If the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals. In light of the uncertainties and risks and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy affirming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time, the committee will take into account the cumul of tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping long-return inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. Thank you. Chris Regaber at Associated Press. I wanted to ask how should we interpret the addition of the word any before additional affirming in the statement? Does that mean that you're pretty much done with rate hikes and the committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and total more neutral stance? Thank you. So, specifically on any, we do say that in determining the extent of any additional policy affirming that may be appropriate, so any additional policy affirming that sentence. So we added the word any as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the peak rate for this cycle. Participants didn't write down additional hikes that we believe were likely, so that's where we wrote down. But participants also didn't want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table, so that's really what we were thinking.",0.001602529860473,39,2023-12-13,True,False,False,False,"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains

 Will the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate some time next year – and, if so, by how much?.Their hopes for cuts were fuelled last month when Christopher Waller, a leading Fed official who had pushed for higher rates since inflation erupted in 2021, surprisingly suggested that the Fed might decide to cut rates as early as spring if inflation kept falling..Speaking recently at Spelman College in Atlanta, the Fed chair cautioned that “it would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to fully defeat inflation..The core inflation rate for November, announced earlier today (Tuesday), was 4%, still twice the ~2% level desired by the Fed..Their hopes for cuts were fueled last month when Christopher Waller, a leading Fed official who had pushed for higher rates since inflation erupted in 2021, surprisingly suggested that the Fed might decide to cut rates as early as spring if inflation kept falling..Easing inflation in 2023 has raised hopes for a gentler Federal Reserve and a strong stock market in 2024..“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.”

2023-12-13 20:00:00,2023-12-13 20:05:00," Thank you. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television Radio. Mr. Chairman, you were by your own admission behind the curve in starting raise rates to fight inflation. And you said earlier, again, the full effects of our tightening cycle have not yet been felt. How will you decide when to cut rates and how will you ensure you're not behind the curve there? So we're aware of the risk that we would hang on too long. We know that that's a risk and we're very focused on not making that mistake. And we do regard the two, we've come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it. Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the price stability mandate and we're getting back to the point where, which is what you do when you're very far from one of the two mandates, you're getting now back to the point where both mandates are important and they're more in balance too. So I think we'll be very much keeping that in mind as we make policy going forward. And the things we'll be looking at, I've already described, we're obviously looking hard at what's happening with demand. And what we see, we see the same thing, other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year. And you see what the forecast are. I think the median growth, median participant wrote down 1.4% growth, but you know, we'll have to see. It's very hard to predict. We'll also be looking to see progress on inflation and the labor market remaining strong, but ideally without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes. When you begin the cutting cycle, will it be essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates where you basically do trial and error cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress? We haven't typically tried to articulate with one exception, a really specific target levels, which was if you, some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in, I guess, 2013. The answer is, these are things that we haven't, you know, really worked out yet. We're sort of just at the beginning of that discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence, the Fox Business. So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is showing about 75 basis points, does that signal that there's a belief of weakness next year in the economy? Well, first of all, let me just say that isn't a plan. That's just accumulating what people wrote down. So that's not something you know this, but allow me to say it again. We don't debate or discuss what the right, you know, whose SEP is right. We just say what they are and we tabulate them and publish them. So it's important for people to know that, but it wouldn't need to be a sign of, it could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing and doesn't need the tight policy. It depends on the economy can evolve in many different ways, right? So, but it could be more what I just described. And you focused on core inflation. We've heard from in other meetings how sticky is core inflation right now? Well, that's what we're finding out. And we've, you know, we've seen real progress in core inflation. It has been sticky and famously the service sector is thought to be sticky or, but we've actually seen reasonable progress in non-housing services, which was the area where you would expect to see less progress. We are seeing some progress there though. In fact, all three of the categories of core are now contributing goods, housing services, non-housing services. They're all contributing in different, at different levels, you know, meeting by meeting or rather report by report. So, yeah. Okay, let's go to Katarina. Katarina, sir. I have a Bloomberg news. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this, you know, this morning and yesterday. I'm assuming those were not incorporated into the forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, you know, on the inflation outlook. Right. So we got, we got CPI the morning of the first day and we got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE. So it's very, very late in the game, you know, to, to, but nonetheless, participants are allowed to encourage to up to.",0.0018838404802196,40,2023-12-13,True,False,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST December 13, 2023

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on December 13, 2023:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective December 14, 2023..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective December 14, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate

 Will the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate some time next year – and, if so, by how much?.Their hopes for cuts were fuelled last month when Christopher Waller, a leading Fed official who had pushed for higher rates since inflation erupted in 2021, surprisingly suggested that the Fed might decide to cut rates as early as spring if inflation kept falling..Speaking recently at Spelman College in Atlanta, the Fed chair cautioned that “it would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to fully defeat inflation..He also said it was too soon to “speculate” about rate cuts..That leaves the attention on Powell’s press conference and the Fed’s dot plot of future policy trajectory, to see how far it diverges from markets current pricing of over 100 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by the end of next year..“We need to be focused on what the Fed - and ECB - are going to say, and what pushback to current pricing we’ll get..Expectations for a rate cut have risen to ~42% in March 2024 as per the CME's FedWatch tool..That's a marked shift with such optimism for a rate cut feeding the rally..While mixed economic data creates significant uncertainty, the status of the Fed's inflation fight remains clear, Powell said, noting that the task will require a further slowdown in price increases..The Fed’s post-meeting statement could also suggest that the central bank isn’t leaning toward hiking again, specifically by nixing the usual “additional policy firming” phrase, though that change could also come at a future meeting..“Having come so far so quickly, the [Fed] is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,” Powell said during a discussion in Atlanta..“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.”

 Recent economic data have modestly cooled financial markets’ expectations for early rate cuts..Chair Jerome Powell's remarks during the meeting further reinforced this shift in focus, suggesting that while the Fed remains prepared to hike rates if necessary, the primary concern is now when to implement rate reductions as inflation eases..Market Overview: -Fed holds rates steady but pivots to dovish tone, forecasting rate cuts in 2024..Looking Ahead: -The Fed's pivot from hiking to easing marks a turning point in the fight against inflation..The Fed's readiness to pivot, following a substantial 5.25 percentage point hike in rates, reflects the recent deceleration in price pressures and a cooling labor market..Comments from Governor Christopher Waller, a staunch supporter of the Fed’s inflation-taming measures, have fueled speculation about the central bank's readiness to lower rates as inflation subsides..Hotter-than-expected US inflation data fuelled speculation Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell will push back on rate cut expectations at the last meeting for 2023..With a new year beckoning and mixed signals on how the economy is doing, let’s see what the data are telling us about 2024’s prospects and what that means for those holding some of the economic levers at the Federal Reserve..All of this, coupled with diminishing inflation, suggests it’s finally time for the Fed to take its foot off the brakes and gingerly nudge the accelerator.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: behind the curve, trial and error cut, sticky core inflation, strong economy performance, median growth participant
2. Second Text: maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent, cumulative tightening, implications for monetary policy, primary credit rate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the themes of inflation and interest rate decisions taken by the Federal Reserve.
2. Discussions in both texts revolve around monitoring economic indicators and their implications for future monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on the Fed's past decisions and the need to avoid being ""behind the curve"" in raising or cutting rates, highlighting uncertainty and the need for caution.
2. The second text emphasizes the current state of the economy, mentioning recent economic indicators, and presents a more structured approach to future monetary policy, indicating an operational and procedural tone.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a detailed, interactive conversation hinting at the uncertainty of the economic outlook and the reactionary nature of policy adjustments.
2. The second text delivers a formal policy announcement outlining current rates and future considerations in a more concise manner, with less conversational nuance.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses conversational phrases like ""trial and error cut"" and ""sticky core inflation,"" which convey a more informal tone suited for a Q&A format.
2. The second text employs technical terminology like ""cumulative tightening"" and ""primary credit rate,"" which reflects a formal, institutional communication style.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. It acknowledges risks and challenges (""we're aware of the risk that we would hang on too long""), but it also offers a sense of optimism about the balancing of mandates and the strong performance of the economy in 2023 (""we regard the two, we've come back into a better balance... a strong economy... good evidence and good reason to believe...""). The second text, however, presents a more cautious view, stating that ""Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed"" and emphasizing the challenges posed by ""tighter financial and credit conditions."" The language used in the first text conveys a confidence in future decision-making and a proactive approach, contrasting with the more reserved and cautious tone of the second text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a higher level of certainty than the second text. Phrases such as ""we're very focused on not making that mistake"" and ""we see... a strong economy"" reflect a confident outlook on the current situation and future policy considerations. In contrast, the second text incorporates uncertainty about the impact of monetary policy and the economic outlook, stating, ""the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate... will take into account the cumulative tightening"" and describes economic conditions with qualifiers like ""likely to weigh on."" This indicates a more tentative approach, contrasting with the more assured tone of the first text, which presents a clear intent regarding the Federal Reserve's monitoring and decision-making processes.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: ""tightening cycle,"" ""price stability mandate,"" ""core inflation,"" ""non-housing services,"" ""trial and error cut,"" ""strong economy,"" ""median participant.""
2. Second Text: ""rate cuts,"" ""Fed policy decision,"" ""hawkish direction,"" ""monetary policy,"" ""market expectations,"" ""soft landing,"" ""CME's FedWatch tool,"" ""FOMC,"" ""dovish tone.""

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rates in the context of inflation and economic performance.
2. Each text emphasizes the need for the Fed to balance between the risks of over-tightening and under-tightening monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses heavily on the mechanisms and discussions surrounding rate increases and the potential for cuts, while the second text emphasizes market expectations and the overall monetary policy direction more broadly.
2. The first text takes a more analytical tone regarding specific responses to economic indicators, whereas the second text exhibits a more speculative tone on future rate cuts and market behavior.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides detailed insights into specific inflation-related metrics and how they influence Fed policy, while the second text discusses broader implications of rate cuts and market expectations without delving into specific current metrics as deeply.
2. The first text discusses the Fed's individual mandates, particularly price stability, while the second text addresses the overall sentiment and market reactions to potential policy shifts.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text employs terminology such as ""tightening cycle,"" and ""price stability mandate,"" which is less emphasized in the second text, which instead uses terms like ""hawkish direction"" and ""soft landing.""
2. The second text introduces phrases like ""CME's FedWatch tool"" and ""FOMC"" that are not present in the first text, highlighting differences in the analytical frameworks used to assess Fed policy.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a slightly more positive emotional bias compared to the second text. This is evident in phrases like ""we're aware of the risk that we would hang on too long"" and ""we see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year,"" which conveys a sense of cautious optimism about the economy. The acknowledgment of risks is balanced with a positive assessment of the current state of the economy, suggesting a belief in ongoing improvement. In contrast, the second text has a more neutral tone overall, characterized by statements such as ""While mixed economic data creates significant uncertainty"" and ""inflation remains a pesky problem for the Fed."" This indicates a more reserved stance without the optimistic outlook present in the first text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty  
Explanation: The certainty levels in both texts are similarly moderate. The first text includes phrases like ""we'll have to see"" and ""these are things that we haven't really worked out yet,"" indicating some uncertainty while also displaying a degree of confidence in the management of monetary policy. The second text similarly reflects moderate certainty, shown in statements like ""the Fed remains prepared to hike rates if necessary"" and ""it's just a forecast right now and is subject to change."" Both texts acknowledge uncertainties regarding future rate cuts and economic conditions, meaning neither conveys high certainty but maintains a comparable level of assurance about current assessments."
2023-12-13 20:10:00,2023-12-13 20:14:51," If there was something different about the U.S. economy. Yeah, so it's not that it may or may not be about different the U.S. economy being different. I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload pot boiling over kind of inflation that we think about. It was a combination of very strong demand without question and unusual supply side restrictions, on the good side but also on the labor side because we had a participation shock. So this is just very unusual. And we had the view, my colleagues and I broadly had the view that we could get a lot of, you know, we had essentially a vertical supply curve because you ran into the limits of capacity at very low levels because there weren't workers and because people couldn't, the supply chains were all broken. So we had the view that you could come straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand lowered. Reduced and you know something like that has happened. It happened so far. The question is, you know, once that part of it runs out and we think it has a ways to run. We definitely think that the sort of supply chain and shortages side has some ways to run. Does labor force participation have much more to run? It might, immigration could help but it may be that at some point you will run out of supply side help. And then it goes down to demand and it gets harder. That's very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be different, I'd be reluctant to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We just don't know. I mean inflation keeps coming down. The labor market keeps getting back into balance. And you know, it's so far so good although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here but so far it hasn't. I'm going to make it the last question. Hi Chair Powell, thanks for taking our questions, making Cousello with Barons. I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed's focus now on proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts. And can you talk us through what the latest thinking is and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at all? We're not talking about altering the pace of QT right now. Just to get that out of the way. So balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected. What we've been seeing is that we're allowing runoff each month. That's adding up. I think we're down. We're close to 1.2 trillion now. That's showing up the reverse repo facility has been coming down quickly and reserves have been either moving up or as a result or holding steady. At a certain point, they won't be any more to come out of. There'll be a level where the reverse repo facility levels out. And at that point, reserves will start to come down. We still have, you know, that we intend to reduce our securities holders until we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that consistent with ample reserves. And we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level. Judge to be consistent with ample reserves. We're not at those levels with reserves close to 3.5 trillion. We're not, we don't think we're at those reserves. There isn't a lot of evidence of that. We're watching it carefully. And so far it's working pretty much as expected with you. Adjusting that thinking at all by the time you're considering or moving forward with rate cuts. Is that time to rethink? Are you still going to follow that thinking? So I think they're on independent tracks. So you're asking the other question. I guess you're implying the question of can you continue with QT at such time with QT, which is a tightening action at such time as policy is still tight? And the answer is it depends on the reason. If you're cutting rates because you're going back to normal, that's one thing. If you're cutting them because the economy is really weak. So you can imagine you have to know what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.

 and approach used to implement monetary policy.","""Although 2023 didn’t bring the scale of hikes we saw in 2022, the Fed still surprised markets in a hawkish direction..The Fed will continue to hold rates higher for longer and will observe data for future policy decisions' - I wrote this for him..""Given where inflation is now, the Fed may be willing to hold rates steady for all of 2024, or even consider hiking if inflation doesn't cooperate..With inflation mostly easing now, that would be a lower bar for rate cuts than the most likely alternative scenario: A sharp economic slowdown that could prompt even faster rate reductions..Speaking recently at Spelman College in Atlanta, the Fed chair cautioned that “it would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to fully defeat inflation..“We need to be focused on what the Fed - and ECB - are going to say, and what pushback to current pricing we’ll get..Such a decision would match the choice made by the Fed at its most recent meeting in September, when the central bank paused its inflation fight amid growing optimism that the U.S. could achieve normal price levels without falling into a recession..Lately, the economy has rebuked such concerns..In recent months, mixed signals from the economy have complicated the Fed's effort to bring down inflation while averting a recession, an outcome known as a ""soft landing."".In theory, the economy should eventually falter as it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow..While mixed economic data creates significant uncertainty, the status of the Fed's inflation fight remains clear, Powell said, noting that the task will require a further slowdown in price increases..What’s happening with the economy?.Pollsters and economists say there has never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception..“It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance, or to speculate on when policy might ease.”
 But any additional rate increases aren’t reflected in futures..In the latter scenario, with inflation slowing and rates unchanged at a high level, that would mean that inflation-adjusted, “real” interest rates are rising, unnecessarily constraining the economy..Whether a deteriorating economy or inflation’s defeat elicits rate cuts next year is anyone’s guess..“I’m thinking about whether we have enough tightening in the system and are sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability.”
 The state of the US economy
 Inflation remains a pesky problem for the Fed..The final mile of the Fed’s inflation fight could be the most difficult, possibly requiring the economy to cool further, and Powell and other Fed officials have said as much..Overall, the US economy remains resilient, steering clear of a recession so far, instead raising even more hopes that the Fed could pull off a soft landing — a situation in which inflation slows without a sharp rise in unemployment..With inflation down sharply from its peak two summers ago and the economy still solid despite high interest rates, hopes have been rising that the Fed can pull off that perfect landing..That was softer than economists expected..While it's impossible to predict how the economy will fare in 2024, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a Wall Street Journal summit on Tuesday that she believes the US is on a path toward a soft landing, in which the country can continue fighting inflation while avoiding a severe economic downturn..""And I see no reason, on the path that we're currently on, why inflation shouldn't gradually decline to levels that are consistent with the Fed's mandate and targets..Advertisement
 Yellen also noted that when it comes to a recession hitting the US, she doesn't see a ""solid intellectual basis for making such a prediction."".Still, some recession concerns for 2024 are in the air — UBS economists, for example, wrote in a recent note that they expect a recession in the second or third quarter of 2024 due to ""the ongoing slowdown in both headline and core inflation."".“We know that’s a risk, and we’re very focused on not making that mistake.”
 At the same time, Powell suggested that while further rate hikes seem unlikely, the Fed’s policymakers will keep that option open in case of a resurgence of inflation..So far, the Fed has achieved what few observers had thought possible a year ago: Inflation has tumbled without an accompanying surge in unemployment or a recession, which typically coincide with a central bank’s efforts to cool the economy and curb inflation..On Wednesday, the Fed’s quarterly economic projections showed that its officials envision a “soft landing” for the economy, in which inflation would continue its decline toward the central bank’s 2% target without causing a steep downturn..Some Fed members have suggested that they are starting to ponder whether policy is now sufficiently restrictive to quell inflation, while others have argued that several more months of slowing price growth may be needed before a cut is justified..Such a trend could theoretically lend unwanted upward pressure to wages and, by extension, inflation..The Fed's readiness to pivot, following a substantial 5.25 percentage point hike in rates, reflects the recent deceleration in price pressures and a cooling labor market..“We expect the US consumer to pull back on spending so much so that the US economy falls into a mild recession and inflation settles below the Fed 2 per cent target,” said CBA economist Carol Kong..Some investors, however, believe the fight against inflation is far from over, and more needs to be done..With a new year beckoning and mixed signals on how the economy is doing, let’s see what the data are telling us about 2024’s prospects and what that means for those holding some of the economic levers at the Federal Reserve..At first glance, the economy is slowing but not enough to set off any recession alarms..Retail sales growth is weakening, industrial production growth was negative for September and October, manufactured goods orders are down, new home sales are falling, and given the return of some 47,000 striking workers, November’s 200,000 added jobs don't look as impressive..Consider the relationship between the nation’s money supply and job openings..Does this mean a recession?.Others will feel what seem like local recessions..All of this, coupled with diminishing inflation, suggests it’s finally time for the Fed to take its foot off the brakes and gingerly nudge the accelerator.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text conveys a more cautious and somewhat pessimistic sentiment about the future of inflation and labor participation. Phrases such as ""I'd be reluctant to suggest that we have any certainty around that"" and ""it gets harder"" reflect a degree of doubt. This contrasts with the second text, which has a more optimistic tone, as it mentions “growing optimism” and the possibility of achieving “a soft landing.” Additionally, the references in the second text to the Fed's achievements in managing inflation without a recession suggest a positive outlook, evident in terms like “inflation has tumbled without an accompanying surge in unemployment.” 

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty through various phrases indicating uncertainty. The speaker uses phrases like “we just don’t know,” and “it might, immigration could help but it may be that at some point you will run out of supply side help,” showcasing a lack of confidence in predicting economic outcomes. In contrast, the second text presents a more stable picture of the Fed's policies and intentions, using phrases like “remains clear” and “we expect the US consumer to pull back on spending,” which indicates a higher level of certainty regarding economic forecasts and policies."
2024-01-31 19:30:00,2024-01-31 19:35:00," Good afternoon. My colleague is and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made good progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation has eased from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news. But inflation is still too high on going progress in bringing it down is not assured. In the path forward is uncertain. I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2% goal. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings. Over the past 2 years, we have significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory and we've been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3%. For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1%. Bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment. The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past 3 months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a pace that is well below that's seen a year ago, but still strong. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers. The labor force participation rate has moved up on balance over the past year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobs to workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. Inflation has eased notably over the past year, but remains above our longer run goal of 2%. Total PCE prices rose 2.6% over the 12 months ending in December, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9%. The lower inflation readings over the second half of last year are welcome, but we will need to see continuing evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5.25% of points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25% and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways.",0.0010490589324283,42,2024-01-31,True,False,False,False,"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated..The economic outlook is uncertain, and the

2024-01-31 19:35:00,2024-01-31 19:40:00," since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured. The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate. As labor market tightness has eased, and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we've seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer run, longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Our storing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to our questions. Thank you. Thank you. Obviously, in the statement and your remarks there, you don't want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming down fully. What do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence? As you make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the solid inflation progress you've been seeing? How are you weighing the growth data and consumption data which have been surprisingly strong against inflation data? Okay. So what are we looking for to get greater confidence? Let me say that we have confidence. We're looking for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%. And, implicitly, we do have confidence and has been increasing, but we want to get greater confidence. What do we want to see? We want to see more good data. It's not that we're looking for better data. We're looking at continuation of the good data that we've been seeing. And a good example is inflation. So we have six months of good inflation data. The question really is, that's six months of good inflation data. Is it sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a sustainable path down to 2% inflation? That's the question. And the answer will come from some more data that's also good data. It's not that the six month data isn't low enough. It is. So, what is the question of can we take that with confidence that we're moving sustainably down to 2%? That's really what we're thinking about. In terms of growth, we've had strong growth. I mean, if you take a step back, we've had strong growth, very strong growth last year, going right into the fourth quarter. And yet we've had a very strong labor market, and we've had inflation coming down. So I think, whereas a year ago, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening and economic activity. That hasn't been the case. So I think we look at stronger growth, we don't look at it as a problem. I think at this point, we want to see strong growth. We want to see a strong labor market. We're not looking for a weaker labor market. We're looking for inflation to continue to come down as it has been coming down for the last six months. And I'm sorry, if I could just follow up very quickly. When you say that you want to make sure that the true signal is there anything that you're seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it's a true signal at this stage? I think it's, I would say it seems to be the likely case that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it and we haven't yet. And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have six months of good inflation. But you can, and you know this, you can look behind those numbers and you can see that a lot of it's been coming from goods inflation, for example. And goods inflation running significantly negative. That's a reasonable assumption that over time goods inflation will flatten out probably approximate zero. That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So in other words, what we care about is the aggregate number, not so much the composition. But we just need to see more. That's where we are as a committee.

Powell, the Fed’s chair, said that the country had “six good months” of moderating inflation, but officials wanted to see continued progress before lowering rates..“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Mr. Powell said..In the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, some Fed officials have been signaling that the current rate has been enough to knock inflation down toward the central bank's 2% target..In remarks this month, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that slowing inflation, combined with continued steady employment gains had led to an economic landscape that was “almost as good as it gets.”
 “The progress I have noted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2%,” he said in written remarks to the Brookings Institution, according to The Associated Press..""It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates."".The Fed is largely expected to hold interest rates steady at multi-decade highs, but investors are turning their attention to any signs of when — and how much — the central bank will turn to rate cuts, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports..The Fed’s goal is to slow inflation so that even smaller pay increases can result in inflation-adjusted income gains..Then, on Nov. 28, in a speech titled ""Something Appears To Be Giving,"" Waller said that rate cuts would be warranted if inflation continued to ease over the next three to five months..That pretty much cemented the outlook for a rate cut by the May 1 Fed meeting..Photo by Ken Cedeno/UPI | License Photo

1. First Text: pandemic, inflation objective, policy restraint, labor market tightness, strong growth, true signal, goods inflation, services sectors 
2. Second Text: maximum employment, economic outlook, monetary policy stance, maintain the interest rate, voting for the monetary policy action, primary credit rate

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss inflation and the aim to achieve a target rate of 2%.
2. Both mention the importance of monitoring economic data and risks while considering adjustments to the federal funds rate.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the ongoing challenges and uncertainties post-pandemic, stressing the careful balance needed in policy adjustments, while the second text adopts a more formal tone focused on affirmations of commitment to the established goals, indicating a sense of achieved stability.
2. The first text discusses recent strong growth in consumer spending as a part of the narrative, while the second text presents a broader overview without delving into specific dynamics of consumer behavior.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a more in-depth exploration of the implications of economic indicators (like goods vs services inflation) on policymaking, whereas the second text is more straightforward and lists decisions without detailing the rationale as extensively.
2. The first text includes more interactive discourse regarding the need for stronger confidence in future inflation trends than the second text, which focuses on affirming commitments and procedural outlines.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text includes terms like ""labor market tightness,"" which focuses on employment conditions, while the second text refers to ""maximum employment,"" which is a broader metric of labor market health.
2. The second text uses terminology specific to Federal Reserve operational decisions (e.g., ""open market operations,"" ""primary credit rate"") that are not mentioned in the first text, which is more conversational and focused on policy rationale.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a slightly more positive emotional bias through phrases such as ""the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance"" and ""we remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal."" These statements reflect a sense of optimism regarding economic stability and inflation control. In contrast, the second text, while reporting a similar sentiment regarding inflation and employment goals, has more cautious language such as ""the economic outlook is uncertain,"" which suggests a more reserved stance. The first text's repeated emphasis on ""confidence"" and ""strong growth"" creates a slightly more optimistic outlook when compared to the second text's straightforward acknowledgment of current economic uncertainties.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a higher level of certainty, as illustrated by phrases like ""we have confidence"" and ""we want to see strong growth."" The speaker expresses assurance in their understanding of the current inflation data and emphasizes that they require ""greater confidence"" as they analyze ongoing economic developments. In contrast, the second text uses phrases such as ""the economic outlook is uncertain"" and ""the Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence,"" which indicates a more cautious approach. This suggests that while both texts deal with economic uncertainties, the first text's language implies a firmer belief in positive outcomes, thus reflecting a higher certainty level.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: federal funds rate, target range, policy restraint, inflation expectations, maximum employment
2. Second Text: interest rates cut, borrowing costs, tightening cycle, moderating inflation, economic landscape

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts and considerations concerning inflation and interest rates.
2. Both emphasize the importance of confidence in inflation trends and data analysis before making adjustments to monetary policy.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text focuses on the careful assessment of risks and data before making decisions, reflecting a more cautious and analytical approach.
2. The second text leans more toward the anticipation of potential rate cuts, discussing optimism about moving forward with policy adjustments in the near future.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides a detailed view on the need for ongoing data collection and emphasizes the current uncertainty in the economic outlook.
2. The second text summarizes policy expectations and projections related to interest rate cuts while focusing on recent improvements in inflation metrics.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text uses terms like ""policy restraint"" and ""target range"" that are more centered around the mechanics of interest rate management.
2. The second text employs phrases like ""borrowing costs"" and ""tightening cycle,"" which reflect a broader narrative about the effects of interest rate changes on the economy.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text conveys a more cautious and uncertain perspective, particularly in phrases like ""the economic outlook is uncertain,"" and ""reducing policy restraint too soon, or too much, could result in a reversal of the progress we've seen on inflation,"" which suggest a sense of wariness. In contrast, the second text contains phrases such as ""the country had six good months of moderating inflation,"" and ""the progress I have noted on inflation... has made me more confident,"" which offer a subtly more optimistic outlook. The emphasis in the second text on confidence in future inflation trends contributes to a slightly more positive sentiment overall.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text displays a lower level of certainty as it repeatedly emphasizes the need for ""greater confidence,"" stating ""the committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence."" This indicates that the speaker has not yet reached a definitive conclusion about future actions. The second text, however, expresses a higher level of certainty with phrases like ""we believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle,"" which indicates a forward-looking assurance. The difference in wording reflects a clear distinction in certainty levels, with the first text leaning towards ambiguity and the second towards assurance."
2024-01-31 19:45:00,2024-01-31 19:50:00," the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong. If we saw an unexpected weakening in certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner, absolutely. And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things would argue for moving later. In the base case, though, where the economy is healthy, and we have, you know, we have fond going growth, solid growth, we have a strong labor market, we have inflation coming down. That's what people are writing their SEP around. And in that case, what we're saying is based on that, we think we can and should take advantage of that and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction. Thank you. Claire Jones, financial times, just a circle back to the greater confidence aspect of the statement. There's been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings and just wondering going forward when it comes to all needing greater confidence. Is the unanimity or at least consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater confidence is? And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you know, about the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates and also if there was any variation on how quickly that greater confidence threshold could be reached. Thank you. So we're not really at that stage. You know, there was no proposal to cut rates. Some people did, you know, talk about their view of the rate path. I would point you to the SCP as good evidence of where people are, although it is one cycle later. So, you know, we're not at a place of really working out those kinds of details because we weren't actively considering, you know, moving the federal funds rate down. I will say there is a wide disparity, a healthy disparity of views and you see that in public statements in the minutes and the transcripts when they're released every five years. So we do have a healthy set of differences and I think that's actually essential for making good policy. We're also able to reach agreement generally because we listen to each other, we compromise and even though not everybody loves what we do, they're able to, for the most part, able to join in to me. That's a well-functioning public institution. Rachel. Hi, Chair Powell, Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. So over the past few years, there have been all these real-time indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like, open table data or office attendance. You've talked about vacancies in the past. And I'm wondering at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that's giving you the clearest picture of the economy, including on runs if you could touch on that. Including. Rent. That's awesome. Yeah. Well, so we're not, you know, it's not the pandemic. So we can actually rely on more traditional forms. People are working, they're getting wages and the economy is largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see. So I wouldn't say we're looking at that sort of more innovative data as much. You know, you point to rent. So of course, we follow the components of inflation very carefully, which would be goods inflation. We talked about that a little bit. You mentioned housing inflation. So the question is when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rent measurement as measured in PCE inflation? And we think that's coming. And we know it's coming. It's just a question of when and how big it'll be. So that's in everyone's forecast, I would say. So that will help. But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably, it's been giving a lot of disinflation to the effort and probably that declines over time. But it may well have some more time to run. You know, the supply chains are not perfectly back to where they were. In addition, it takes time for the healing process to get into prices. So there may be still a tailwind. We'll find out with that. So we look at the things that relate to our mandate very carefully. And as you would imagine. I guess this is a quick follow-up. Do you feel comfortable at this point saying the economy has reached a soft landing? Or is that part of looking for more confidence? No. I wouldn't say we would achieve that. I think we have a way to go. Inflation is still, core inflation is still well above target on a 12-month basis. 12 months is our target. Certainly, I'm encouraged and we're encouraged by the progress. But we're not declaring victory at all at this point. We think we have a way to go.

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on January 31, 2024:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective February 1, 2024..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective February 1, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:
 o Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate
 in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.","Federal Reserve officials, seeking more progress on the fight against inflation, hinted that their next move will be a cut in interest rates — just not yet..“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Mr. Powell said..In the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, some Fed officials have been signaling that the current rate has been enough to knock inflation down toward the central bank's 2% target..Still, traders believe the economy remains strong enough that they have estimated the probability of the Fed's first rate cut happening in March at 61.5% — down from a 73% likelihood a month ago..Not everyone is that optimistic about an imminent rate cut..""It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates."".That pretty much cemented the outlook for a rate cut by the May 1 Fed meeting..Advertisement

2024-01-31 19:50:00,2024-01-31 19:55:00," I said that you would know the neutral rate by its works. So I'm wondering what you could tell me, how do you believe the neutral rate is working, we're telling you right now that growth is stronger. In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate? And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down? I think you do see in the interest sensitive parts of the economy, you do see, for example, housing, you see the effects. Your second question, though, really, I think, is important. And that is a lot of this has come through a lot of the disinflationary processes come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market. So you've seen that other set of factors is really different from other cycles and has brought that working with tighter policy, which is enabled to supply side to recover. I think that mixture has been behind what has enabled this. So we really do think that we're having an effect broadly across the economy. I would point to the interest sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally. But it's a joint story. It's a complicated story. But how much restraint are you actually imparting to the economy? Would you say relative to the neutral rate? Of course, you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision. But if you, a standard approach would be to take the nominal rate 5.3 percent, let's say, and subtract sort of a forward measure of inflation. If you do that, there are many, many ways to calculate that neutral rate. But that's what I like to do. And you're going to get to something that is materially above mainstream estimates of neutrality of the neutral rate, you will. But at the same time, you look at the economy and you say this is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. And you say, what does that tell you about the neutral rate? What's happening, though, is the supply side has been recovering in the middle of this. So that won't go on forever. So a lot of the growth we're seeing is not, it isn't just a tug of war between interest rates and demand. You're getting more activity because of the labor market healing and supply chains healing. So I think the question is when that peters out, I think the restriction will show up probably more sharply. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks for taking the question from some experiment. You mentioned earlier we're not seeking a weaker labor market. I think you said, can you talk a little bit more about that? Do you think the labor market now is back to quote unquote normal? And that we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming back down to what they were pre-pandemic, even with today's ECI levels, they were still above those pre-pandemic levels. I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing normal, but not totally back to normal. And you pointed to one or more of them. So I think job openings are not quite back to where they were. Wages are, wage increases rather are not quite back to where they would need to be in the longer run. I would look at it this way, though. The economy is broadly normalizing and so is the labor market. So the process will probably take some time. So wage setting is something that happens. It's probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back. And that's okay. That's okay. But we do see, you saw today's ECI reading, you know, the evidence is that wage increases are still at a healthy level, very healthy level, but they're gradually moving back to levels that would be more associated, given assumptions about productivity, or more typically associated with 2% inflation. It's an ongoing process, a healthy one, and I think we're moving in the right direction. So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically. I think the labor market is, it's rebalancing. Clearly there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers and supply at the beginning of the pandemic. So we lost several million workers at the beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force. And then when the economy reopened, you remember, 2021, you had a severe labor shortage. It was everywhere panic on a part of businesses couldn't find people. So what's happened is we expected labor, the labor supply labor market to come back quickly, and it didn't. And in 2022 was a disappointing year, and we were kind of thinking, well, maybe we won't get it back. And then in 2023, we did. As you know, so labor force participation came back strongly in 23, and so did immigration.",-0.0013938996392258,45,2024-01-31,True,False,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024

Powell, the Fed’s chair, said that the country had “six good months” of moderating inflation, but officials wanted to see continued progress before lowering rates..“We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,” Mr. Powell said..In the run-up to Wednesday's announcement, some Fed officials have been signaling that the current rate has been enough to knock inflation down toward the central bank's 2% target..Some economists believe these higher rates have helped pull down inflation..In remarks this month, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that slowing inflation, combined with continued steady employment gains had led to an economic landscape that was “almost as good as it gets.”
 “The progress I have noted on inflation, combined with the data in hand on economic and financial conditions and my outlook has made me more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2%,” he said in written remarks to the Brookings Institution, according to The Associated Press..At 3.7%, the unemployment rate is now back to pre-pandemic levels, though it has crept higher from the post-pandemic low of 3.4% seen in January 2023..Still, traders believe the economy remains strong enough that they have estimated the probability of the Fed's first rate cut happening in March at 61.5% — down from a 73% likelihood a month ago..""It likely will be midyear before policymakers are confident that they have reined in inflation sufficiently to start cutting their target for short-term interest rates."".The increase in wages and benefits was still mostly healthy, but the slowdown could contribute to the cooling of inflation and will likely be welcomed by Federal Reserve policymakers..Christopher Rugaber, The Associated Press

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the current state of the economy, focusing on growth and inflation.
2. Both address the relationship between interest rates and the labor market, with an emphasis on employment conditions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the complexities of the economic recovery process and the nuanced interaction between interest rates and various sectors of the economy, particularly housing and labor markets. The second text takes a more formal tone, focusing on specific monetary policy decisions and the balance of risks concerning inflation and employment.
2. The first text reflects a more analytical perspective on the neutral rate and its implications for economic performance, whereas the second text presents a straightforward report on the outcomes of a Federal Reserve meeting and the decisions made.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text provides in-depth analysis of the labor market dynamics and expectations regarding wage adjustments over time, while the second text offers a concise overview of current economic indicators without delving into extensive detail about the labor market.
2. The second text includes specific policy actions and metrics like the federal funds rate and reserve balances, indicating a focus on actionable monetary policy, while the first text is more exploratory and discursive.

Specific Terminology Differences:
1. The first text refers to the ""neutral rate"" and ""disinflationary processes,"" terms that are specific to discussions about monetary policy's effectiveness and economic growth, while the second text uses the term ""federal funds rate,"" which is more administrative and regulatory in context.
2.

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text conveys a subtle optimism regarding the economic outlook, particularly in phrases such as ""I think that mixture has been behind what has enabled this"" and ""we do see... evidence is that wage increases are still at a healthy level."" This indicates a belief in the ongoing recovery and a positive interpretation of economic indicators like job growth and wage health. In contrast, the second text is more measured and reports a neutral stance with expressions like ""Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated"" and ""the economic outlook is uncertain,"" which indicates a more cautious perspective. The slight optimism in the first text's exploration of economic factors versus the neutrality of the second text’s presentation of risks showcases the emotional bias difference.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: higher certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses a relatively high level of certainty about the economic mechanics and the trajectory of the labor market, as seen in the passage ""the economy is broadly normalizing and so is the labor market,"" which implies confidence in the remediation progress of the labor market. On the other hand, the second text acknowledges some uncertainty: ""The economic outlook is uncertain,"" which clearly indicates a lower level of confidence regarding future developments.

2. The first text discusses ""wage increases"" specifically, while the second text aggregates this into ""pay and benefits for workers,"" highlighting a difference in scope and analysis.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text reflects a slightly more positive bias, evident in phrases like “I think the economy is broadly normalizing” and “that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, basically,” which convey an optimistic outlook on the ongoing economic recovery. In contrast, the second text includes more cautious expressions, such as “officials wanted to see continued progress before lowering rates” and “there seems to be little reason to cut interest rates,” which imply a more hesitant, less optimistic tone. The first text emphasizes the amalgamation of economic growth factors positively, while the second text maintains a focus on waiting for economic indicators to confirm progress.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text demonstrates a lower level of certainty due to phrases like “it isn't just a tug of war between interest rates and demand,” and “you know that it's not something you can identify with any precision,” indicating a lack of definitive conclusions and an acknowledgment of uncertainty regarding the neutral rate of interest. Conversely, the second text displays higher certainty in its assertions, with statements like “we believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak” and “the U.S. economy will continue to grow and inflation will continue to moderate,” reflecting a more assured stance on the economic situation. The use of “likely” and “believe” in the second text suggests a stronger confidence in predicted outcomes compared to the first text."

So, and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor market to will it still a very strong labor market. It's still a good labor market for wages and for finding a job, but it's getting back into balance and that's what we want to see. And, you know, one great way to look at that is what's happening with wage increases. And you see it now across the major things that we track. It isn't every quarter, but overall there's a clear trend. Still at high levels, but back down to where would be what would be consistent with where we were before the pandemic and with 2% inflation. Chris. Hi, Chris Ruggabour, associated press. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on Rich's question. It sounded like you suggested that you're not worried about faster growth so much. So, I wanted to see if you're seeing anything that suggests inflation could re-accelerate from here. And it sounds like you're saying you're not worried that solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation. Thank you. No, I think that is a risk. The risk that inflation would re-accelerate. I think the greater risk is that it would stabilize at a level meaningfully above 2%. That's to me more likely. Of course, if inflation were to surprise by moving back up, that would be a surprise at this point, but I have to tell you that's why we keep our options open here and why we're not rushing. So, I think both of those are risks, but I think the more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is you've had six good months, very good months. But what's really going to shake out here? When we look back, what will we see? Will the inflation have dipped and then come back up? Are the last six months flattered by factors that are one of the factors that won't repeat themselves? We don't think so. We know there's not what we think, but that's the question we are asking. We have to ask, and we want to get comfort on that. And just one quick follow up. Governor Waller had mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th, or the CPI data. Is that something you're watching as well? And if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you more confidence and where things are going? I will just have to see. Yeah, we'll look at those. Last year was it a surprise. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and television. If you don't want to use the term soft landing, would you say at least that from your point of view now the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the Fed is off the table or the risk of diminished very much? And as you mentioned, below 2% inflation for on a three-month basis, Core PCE has been running at 1.5%. And there are those on Wall Street who think that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target. How do you see that? So how to describe your first question, how to describe where we are. So I guess I would just say this. Executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over the course of last year. The labor market, 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had just about two years now of unemployment under 4% that hasn't happened in 50 years. So it's a good labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is a good situation. Let's be honest. This is a good economy. But what's the outlook? That's looking in the review. The outlook, we do expect growth to moderate. Of course, we have expected it for some time and it hasn't happened. But we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its course. Labor market is rebalancing. As I mentioned, job creation has slowed the base of job growth has narrowed. And of course, 12-month inflation is above target and getting down closer to target. It's not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on track for that. So those are the risks and questions we have to answer. But overall, it's a pretty good picture. It is a good picture. Your second question was, sorry. Could you get inflation that is below target, end up with inflation below target and you have to do something about that? So the thing is, we're not looking for inflation to tap the 2% base once. We're looking for to settle out over time.",-0.0013671353792466,46,2024-01-31,True,False,False,False,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes the ongoing adjustments in the labor market and specific risks of inflation re-acceleration, taking a conversational tone. The second text, however, adopts a more formal tone, focusing on monetary policy decisions and risk assessments regarding inflation and employment.
2. The first text reflects on past performance and the uncertainty of economic outlook, while the second text discusses current decisions and plans in a structured, report-like format.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text includes a more detailed discussion of recent economic performance over the past six months and how that relates to current predictions, while the second text provides a concise overview of current economic indicators and monetary policy decisions without delving into historical context.
2. The first text mentions specific metrics such as unemployment rates and inflation data but focuses more on qualitative observations, while the second text emphasizes future monetary policy actions based on quantitative metrics.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: similar certainty
Explanation: Both texts demonstrate a moderate level of certainty, each acknowledging risks while also conveying a sense of current stability in the economy. The first text states, ""we think both of those are risks,"" and elaborates on uncertainties regarding inflation, indicating a thoughtful yet somewhat reassuring assessment.

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive
Explanation: The first text conveys a subtly more positive sentiment through phrases that reinforce optimism about the labor market and inflation.

2024-01-31 20:00:00,2024-01-31 20:05:00," at 2%. And the same thing is true. If we have a month or two of lower and we have that now of inflation that's annualized at a lower level, that wouldn't be good. We're not looking to have inflation anchor below 2%, we're looking to have it anchor at 2%. So if we do face those circumstances then we'll have to deal with that. I think as of now the question we want to take advantage of this situation and finish the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong. Edward. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you for taking this. So as I've heard from some district Fed presidents is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner and then when we do see that first rate cut is that should be interpret that as the beginning of a rate cut cycle or is it a one off? So I'll point to that language on your first question. We included that language in the statement to signal clearly that with strong growth, strongly of a market inflation coming down, the committee intends to move carefully as we consider when to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place. So if you take that to the current context, current context, we're going to be data dependent, we're going to be looking at this meeting by meeting. Based on the meeting today, I would tell you that I don't think it's likely that the committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that, but that's to be seen. So I wouldn't call, you know, when you say when you ask me about in the near term, I'm hearing that as March, I would say I don't think that's probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base case. Then your second question is on the, is this the start of a, when we see a cut, is it the start of a cutting cycle or is it, you could have just been one off? You know, that's going to depend on the data. The whole thing is this is going to depend on the data. We're going to be looking at the economic data as it affects the outlook and the balance of risks and we're going to make our decisions based on that. And it could wind up, you know, we'll have another SEP at the March meeting and people will write down what they think, but in the end, it's really going to depend on how the economy evolves. We talked about there are risks that would cause us to go slower, for example, stronger inflation, more persistent inflation. There are risks that would cause us to go faster and sooner and that would be a weakening in the labor market or for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation. Those are the kinds of things that we're just, we're just going to be reacting to the data. That's really the only way we can do this. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guido with Politico. Could you talk a little bit more about productivity growth? You've mentioned multiple times about the level of wage growth that's consistent with 2% inflation. We've obviously seen, you know, you were talking about ECI this morning in which it's cooled a little bit, but still sort of above what you wanted to see. Growth has been very strong. How much of those numbers do you attribute to productivity and do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors, the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about or do you think that productivity growth will fade over time? So, this is a really interesting question. And I think my own view is, I think if you look back to the pandemic, you saw a spike in productivity as workers were laid off and activity didn't decline as fast. And then you saw a deep trough of productivity. And then over the last, you saw high productivity last year in 23. I think we're basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy. And the question will be, what is it that has changed the, you know, the productivity tends to be based on, you know, fundamental aspects of our economy? Is there, is there a case, will it be the case that we come out of this more productive, more on a sustained basis? And I don't know, I don't know. What would it take? It would take, you know, people talk about AI. But I would, my guess is that we may shake out and be back where we were because I'm not sure I see work from home doesn't seem like it's a big productivity increase or AI, artificial intelligence generative may be, but probably not in the short run, probably maybe in the longer run. So I'm not, I'm not seeing why it would, but, you know, right, you know, right now, I would say we're, the productivity is kind of what falls out of the broader forces that are driving people in and out of the labor force and activity returning and supply chain is getting fixed. Right. So would that be behind why we've seen such strong growth, but we've also seen inflation fall that maybe there's just a higher level of productivity. That's one way to look at it.

 Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
 The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance
 announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on January 31, 2024:
 • The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the
 interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective February 1, 2024..• As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open
 Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to
 execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following
 domestic policy directive:
 ""Effective February 1, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:

 in a target range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.","Federal Reserve officials, seeking more progress on the fight against inflation, hinted that their next move will be a cut in interest rates — just not yet..Jerome H.

2. Second Text: ""maximum employment,"" ""target range for the federal funds rate,"" ""monitor the implications,"" ""unanimously voted,"" ""economic activity expanding,"" ""balance of risks""

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the importance of maintaining inflation at the target rate of 2%.
2. Both texts emphasize the need to assess economic data continuously and make decisions based on incoming information and risks.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The First Text places a stronger emphasis on individual economic dynamics, personal opinions, and responses to specific queries, while the Second Text has a formal tone that focuses on policy announcements and committee decisions.
2. The First Text discusses productivity in relation to inflation and labor market dynamics, while the Second Text primarily centers around maintaining economic stability and specific rate decisions.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The First Text contains in-depth analysis and discussion about future productivity growth and its dependencies on external factors, whereas the Second Text provides broad updates on monetary policy without exploring the underlying economic mechanics.
2. The Second Text offers specific rate targets and committee decisions, while the First Text elaborates more on potential scenarios affecting inflation and employment.

Specific Terminology Differences:

2. The Second Text incorporates technical terms like ""federal funds rate"" and ""Board of Governors,"" which are not present in the First Text.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative  
Explanation: The first text reflects a slightly more negative emotional bias primarily through its cautionary tone regarding inflation and economic outlook. Phrases such as ""wouldn't be good"" and ""I don't think it's likely"" suggest a pessimistic view of future economic conditions. In contrast, the second text maintains a more balanced and optimistic tone, highlighting that ""economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace"" and that ""the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance."" The first text raises concerns about labor market conditions and inflation while hinting at potential pitfalls, whereas the second text is more resolute about maintaining objectives, which gives it a more positive sentiment.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text displays a lower level of certainty, marked by phrases like ""I don't know"" and ""that's to be seen,"" which indicate significant hesitation and uncertainty about economic predictions. This contrasts with the second text, which communicates a high level of certainty when it states that ""the Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence."" The use of ""will"" and ""judges"" in the second text expresses assurance in decision-making, while the first text's reliance on conditional language suggests a lack of confidence in future outcomes.","Unique Key Terms/Phrases:

1. First Text: data dependent, labor market strong, productivity growth, economic context, risks that would cause us to go slower
2. Second Text: interest rates cut, peak for this tightening cycle, market optimism, dialing back policy restraint, central bank officials signaling

Similarities:

1. Both texts discuss the Federal Reserve's approach to inflation and interest rates.
2. They highlight the importance of economic data in determining monetary policy decisions.

Differences:

Themes/Topics with Different Emphasis or Tone:
1. The first text emphasizes a careful and data-dependent approach to managing inflation, while the second text focuses on the expectations for imminent interest rate cuts and market reactions.
2. The first text highlights uncertainties regarding labor market influences, whereas the second text presents a more optimistic outlook regarding potential rate cuts.

Variations in Detail/Scope:
1. The first text elaborates on the specifics of the meeting and discussions surrounding rate cuts, while the second text offers a broader market perspective on expectations and likely outcomes over the upcoming months.
2. The second text provides an account of the percentages and probabilities for rate cuts happening soon, which the first text does not specify.

1. The first text uses phrases like “finish the job on inflation” and “wage growth consistent with 2% inflation,” while the second text includes terms such as “likely at its peak” and “policy rate.”
2. The first text focuses on real-time meeting discussions and contexts, while the second text emphasizes future projections and market expectations for interest rates.","Emotional Bias Comparison:

First text vs Second text: slightly more negative
Explanation: The first text presents a more cautious tone in discussing inflation and potential rate cuts. Phrases such as ""that wouldn't be good,"" ""I don't think it's likely,"" and ""I wouldn't call... what we would call the base case"" convey a sense of pessimism about immediate economic outcomes and future decisions. In contrast, the second text contains more affirmations of potential improvements and progress, such as ""the country had 'six good months' of moderating inflation"" and ""economists are now hopeful for the first interest rate cut,"" which contribute to a slightly more positive emotional tone. 

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty
Explanation: The first text exhibits a lower level of certainty, illustrated by phrases like ""that’s to be seen,"" ""I don't know,"" and ""it could wind up,"" suggesting unpredictability and open-ended possibilities regarding future inflation and productivity. In comparison, the second text uses phrases such as ""we believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak,"" and ""most Fed watchers think the central bank’s first rate reduction will occur,"" which convey a clear direction and intent from the Federal Reserve, indicating a higher level of certainty about the decisions ahead."

You know, this is why we need to keep price stability. It's why we need to do our jobs is so that people don't have to deal with things like this. In terms of it, you're right. In recent surveys, a couple of, you've seen a couple of significant increases in consumer confidence or happiness with the economy. I guess that's a good thing. That can support spending, can support economic activity. There's some evidence of that. But you're right, it is the fact that we have seen a, you know, meaningful increase. I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they've been at various times, but it's they certainly have come up. Right. Thank you for taking our questions. By the minister and business. Committee members have said they like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in person to learn more about the economy in real time given that some data subject to a large revision, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance and many readings of the economy being quarterly. So did any members say they learned anything? Not you reflected in the data or have you yourself or anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn't been captured in the data yet? Well, yes. I'm a big believer that yes. So we do meet with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy. And I always feel like you, I mean, I, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies, individual companies, individual management teams, and then building out from that. And so starting with GDP data is, and working into what's actually affecting people's lives is, is challenging. It's very hard. So I really like anecdotal data. In addition, as you know, the 12 reserve banks have really the best network of anyone that in all their districts, they're talking to, you know, not just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, you know, nonprofit community. They have arms into all of that. And so when they come back, that's what goes into the beige book, but that they come back in what each reserve bank president does is during the outlook go around, they'll say, in my district, and they'll talk about 100 conversations. They say, not, they won't talk up. They will give you input based on 100 conversations that they've had with people of all different walks. And it's, I personally find it very helpful in understanding what's going on and also I think you hear things before they show up in the data sometimes. Did any of them notice slowing economy based on what they've heard from like their district? Yes. I mean, if you look back, the last, not this beige book, but the one before, it was more, there was a lot of slower activity. I think that what you're hearing now is things are picking up a bit. You're hearing not, not in every district and not every, every person that we talk to, but you're, you're overall, it feels like you're hearing things picking up at the margin. So that's what comes through. Good to Jeff Cox for the last question. Thank you, sir. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just kind of looking to put it all together. You talked about basically the economy looking strong with 3.3% annualized growth in the fourth quarter. Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to you now than any inflation threat might that you know, you're in a position. In other words, to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong and you're more, you're more tilted towards that and also perhaps are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point. I'm not so worried about that. You know, it's, again, we've had a flation come down without a slow economy and without, you know, important increases in unemployment and there's no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process if it's going to continue. So I am, you know, I think I think declining inflation continued declines in inflation are really the main thing we're looking at. Of course, we want the labor market to remain strong too. We don't have a growth mandate. We've got a maximum employment mandate and a price stability mandate and those are the two things we look at growth only matters to the extent it influences our achievement of those two of those two mandates.

The second text also maintains a moderate level of certainty with phrases like ""The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance"" and ""The economic outlook is uncertain,"" suggesting that while there is a recognition of progress, caution is still necessary.

First text vs Second text: slightly more positive  
Explanation: The first text reveals a subtle optimism when discussing the economy, particularly through phrases such as “I guess that’s a good thing” and “it feels like you’re hearing things picking up at the margin.” These indicate a positive outlook despite the challenges mentioned. In contrast, the second text, while acknowledging progress in the economy, involves a more measured tone. It refers to the economy as “almost as good as it gets” and includes a note of caution regarding the need for “continued progress” before any rate cuts can be made. The first text's direct mentions of improvements in consumer confidence combined with a sense of urgency for price stability highlight a slightly more positive sentiment than the more tempered outlook of the second text.

Certainty Level Comparison:

First text vs Second text: lower certainty  
Explanation: The first text expresses uncertainty through phrases like “we’ve seen a, you know, meaningful increase” and “levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ve been,” reflecting a lack of strong confidence in the overall recovery. The frequent use of hedging language such as ""you're right,"" ""I guess,"" and ""I think"" contributes to this sense of uncertainty. Conversely, the second text showcases a higher degree of certainty, particularly with statements like “I have been more confident than I have been since 2021 that inflation is on a path to 2%.” This demonstrates a stronger assurance in the economic outlook compared to the first text. Overall, the first text's reliance on tentative language suggests a lower level of certainty compared to the more confident assertions found in the second text."
