2024Jan,"For release at 2:00 p.m. EST January 31, 2024
 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job
 gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has
 remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of
 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment
 and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the
 Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.
 In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal
 funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the
 federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and
 the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target
 range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.
 In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency
 debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans.
 The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.
 In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to
 monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee
 would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that
 could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take

 Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have

 Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship and is

 Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a modest
 pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained
 low. Inflation remains elevated.
 The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households
 and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of
 these effects remains uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of
 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the
 target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5-14 percent. Holding the target range steady at
 this meeting allows the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for
 monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate
 to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative
 tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and
 inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Committee will continue
 reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed
 securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed
 to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

 monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee
